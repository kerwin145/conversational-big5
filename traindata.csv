0,"I'm pretty open to new experiences, though I haven't actively sought them out lately. Moving to Texas was a big change, and while I initially struggled to adapt, I did enjoy exploring Sixth Street in Austin – a completely different social scene than what I was used to in Virginia.  It felt liberating and exciting to be in a new environment with so much energy.  It reignited a desire for more exploration and experiences, but I haven't actively pursued them.","I used to be incredibly conscientious, meticulously completing my homework in high school.  However, college has been a different story. The increased workload and busywork led me to prioritize getting by rather than striving for excellence.  I regret this now; I recognize that a more disciplined approach would have been beneficial. I haven't found a reliable way to regain that focus, though the prospect of moving out and having more responsibility might motivate a shift back.","Going out on Sixth Street last night was energizing.  Being surrounded by other students and experiencing the vibrant Austin nightlife was a welcome change from the restrictions of living at home.  The contrast with my current, more introverted lifestyle highlighted how much I value social interaction and freedom to explore, even if I may not be extremely extroverted in my personality. I realized I need more of that type of social experience.","I haven't had any major disagreements with anyone lately, but the tension between my desire for independence and my parents' protective approach presents a continuous low-level conflict. I try to be understanding of their concerns, stemming from my sister's past mistakes, but also assert my need for more autonomy.  My priority is to find a way to communicate my needs respectfully and gain their trust to support my moving out.","Living at home and dealing with the constant nagging and restrictions has made me feel anxious and stressed.  My initial response is often avoidance; I tend to withdraw and delay tasks I should be tackling, like helping with the family business.  To cope, I've tried to articulate my frustrations in this essay, allowing me to process my feelings. Gaining more independence is the long-term solution I'm hoping will help to alleviate my stress.",y,n,n,y,y
1,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  Trying new things isn't really my style; I prefer familiarity and things I already understand.  I guess the closest I've come is occasionally trying a new type of food, but even then, I tend to stick to what I know I like.  New experiences can feel overwhelming and uncomfortable.","I'm not really one for meticulously planned schedules or long-term projects. I tend to prioritize immediate tasks and often find myself putting things off until the last minute.  Meeting deadlines can be a struggle, and I don't usually have a system for managing my time efficiently. I'm more spontaneous and flexible in my approach to life.","Large social gatherings drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending time with a few people I'm comfortable with is more fulfilling than being surrounded by a crowd. I value quality time over quantity, and loud, chaotic environments tend to make me anxious.","I generally try to avoid conflict, but I do stand up for myself and others when necessary.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll try to explain my perspective calmly and rationally. I tend to prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising on some points.  I find confrontation uncomfortable and emotionally draining.","Stress and anxiety can be overwhelming for me; I tend to overthink and worry. My initial reaction is usually to withdraw and isolate myself; I need some time to process my feelings before I can effectively cope. I usually try to deal with stressful situations by talking to a friend, or just by calming down and taking a break.",n,n,n,y,n
2,"I've always been drawn to experiences that push my boundaries.  For instance, last year I spontaneously decided to learn how to play the guitar. It wasn't something I'd ever planned, but the idea of creating music intrigued me. Afterward, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and found the process quite relaxing, even if I'm still a long way from being proficient.","One goal I set was finishing my graduate coursework while working part-time.  To stay on track, I meticulously planned my schedule, utilizing to-do lists and calendar reminders.  However, maintaining this level of organization was sometimes difficult, particularly when unexpected tasks or projects arose.  The most rewarding aspect was the satisfaction of completing the degree despite these challenges.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. A recent large gathering where I was forced to engage in superficial conversation left me utterly exhausted. The sheer amount of small talk and the pressure to be constantly “on” were overwhelming.  It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate settings and deeper connections with a select few close friends.","I recently had a disagreement with a lab partner about the best approach to a research project. I tried to explain my perspective calmly but found myself easily frustrated by his unwillingness to compromise. While I valued collaboration, maintaining my own integrity and project goals remained my priority; ultimately, we negotiated a compromise which didn't quite satisfy either of us.","The other day, I had a major panic attack after realizing my funding might run out before I finish my degree. I felt overwhelmed and physically ill but forced myself to take some deep breaths and calmly think through my options.  I eventually created a list of potential backup jobs to ensure I could cover my expenses.",y,y,n,n,y
3,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  My excitement is usually centered around achieving goals and relationships, not necessarily exploring the unknown. However, the essay reflects a situation that’s brand new for me—a significant relationship progressing to a new stage.  The motivation is clearly the potential for a fulfilling relationship, and while the anticipation is overwhelming (and slightly terrifying!), I'm ultimately very happy and hopeful.","The essay shows my conscientiousness through my focus on numerous deadlines, including Calculus problems.  My strategy is to list everything out—lunch plans, remembering to sign a poster, etc.—to ensure nothing is forgotten.  I use support from friends (Portia and Bob) to manage my anxieties, but ultimately, meeting my commitments is a priority and I’ll make it work, even if I have a sleepless night.  The challenge is managing my nerves; the reward is the success of achieving goals and pursuing relationships.","The excitement expressed in my essay indicates a generally extraverted nature. I relish the social interaction, but the underlying nervousness shows the potential for social anxiety.  The ""memorable social experience"" is the upcoming date/event, which fuels a blend of excitement and nervousness. Fulfilling aspects are the anticipation and support from friends; the draining aspects are the intense emotional pressure and self-doubt.","While I haven't described a direct conflict in my essay, my eagerness to please and secure the approval of someone (“it is so important for him to think of me the same way”) demonstrates a highly agreeable personality.  My priorities in any potential disagreement would involve maintaining the relationship and finding common ground; this is evident in my need for reassurance from my friends Portia and Bob and my careful planning to make a good impression.","The essay reveals a high level of anxiety and nervousness, reflecting my neuroticism. My initial response to the stress of this momentous occasion is a flurry of thoughts and worries.  However, I use coping mechanisms such as planning and seeking support from others (Bob and Portia) to manage my emotions.  Rehearsing what I'll say shows an attempt to control the situation and mitigate my anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n
4,"I'm not really one for trying entirely new things, but moving to Texas for college was definitely a big change.  I was motivated by the desire for a fresh start and a new experience after graduating high school and feeling a bit stuck. While it's been challenging adjusting to a new environment, the overall experience has been positive and has expanded my horizons.  I am finding the city of Austin to be a good fit for me.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  Getting started on this assignment the same day it was assigned, was a surprise to me. This is likely due to the fact that I had a lot of free time in high school due to plentiful free periods. I generally prefer to avoid working on things until the last minute, which can lead to stress.  However, college is different, so I am trying to improve my time management skills, as I know I'll need them to be successful.","Being surrounded by lots of people, like in large lecture halls or the campus computer center, can feel overwhelming and a bit draining.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate social settings with close friends, where I feel comfortable being myself. These types of interactions energize me.  Large crowds can make me feel self-conscious and anxious.","I'm pretty easy-going, generally trying to find common ground with others, even when there are disagreements. My priority is to maintain positive relationships; therefore, I tend to prioritize finding common ground, even if I don't always fully agree. I try my best to listen and understand where the other person is coming from, rather than becoming confrontational.","The thought of the workload of college and all the work that is involved, especially when I am not used to this type of work ethic, can be stressful and overwhelming. When I feel stressed, I tend to cope by distracting myself with other things or sometimes just letting myself feel the emotions. It helps me to express my thoughts, like I'm doing in this essay.",y,n,y,y,n
5,"I'm drawn to exploring new ideas and experiences, as evidenced by my interest in shamanism, mycology, and religious studies.  Attending the Pagan Student Alliance meeting was a prime example; I was motivated by curiosity and a desire to connect with like-minded individuals. The experience left me feeling invigorated and inspired, confirming my openness to diverse perspectives and spiritual practices.","I tend to be less focused on detailed planning and strict schedules. While I have goals, like getting my own radio show,  I don’t always meticulously track my progress. The essay shows my scattered thoughts and lack of consistent focus on a singular task.  This isn't to say I don't accomplish things, but my approach is more spontaneous and less rigidly structured.","I enjoy social interaction, especially within smaller, like-minded groups like the Pagan Student Alliance. Meeting new people and engaging in discussions about spiritual topics energizes me. Conversely, prolonged interaction with those who don’t share my interests, or who engage in excessive gaming like my roommate, can leave me feeling drained. I value meaningful connections over large, superficial social events.","I generally strive to be agreeable and understanding, evidenced by my empathy toward Caleb's concern for someone at the PSA meeting, and my reluctance to speak ill of her. However, this doesn't mean I avoid conflict.  I approach disagreements by listening to others' perspectives and finding common ground, though sometimes my own opinions and interests might lead to internal conflict (the indecision over medical technology versus other interests).","While I can experience stress and anxiety (like the frustration with the essay's time limit), I manage it by engaging in calming activities—like focusing on the sensation of typing, or finding fascination in hypnotic patterns.  The essay itself reflects my tendency to process emotions through creative expression and introspection rather than direct confrontation or avoidance.",y,n,y,y,n
6,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven to try new things.  The econ quiz was a fluke, really – pure luck.  I don't usually seek out new experiences unless they're presented to me in a convenient way, like this essay assignment. I'm happy enough sticking to what I know.","Goals?  Honestly, I don't really plan that far ahead.  I do what I need to do to get by. I lucked into a 100 on that econ quiz, but mostly I just go with the flow.  If something comes up, I'll deal with it then.  Sustained effort isn't really my thing.",Large social gatherings drain me. I'm perfectly content in my own company or with a small group of close friends.  I find energy in quiet moments and individual pursuits.  Deep conversations are much more satisfying than noisy parties.,"Disagreements aren't something I enjoy, but I'll usually go along with whatever will make the situation easier. I prioritize avoiding conflict. I'm a fairly passive person. It’s much easier to just agree to disagree.","Stress and anxiety? I try not to dwell on things. The thought of Mrs. Lug, for example, is sad, but I don't let myself stay upset for long. I mostly just focus on what is happening in the moment. Things will work out somehow.",n,n,n,y,n
7,"I'm constantly seeking new experiences, whether it's exploring different musical genres or delving into new technologies.  For example, my foray into the RTF305 Usenet site, despite its flaws, represents a step into the unknown digital realm. Although I encountered frustrations, the need to access this resource motivated me to try it. I'm fascinated by technology and its capacity for connecting people. While my initial experience was fraught with problems, I am eager to master new digital challenges and refine my skills.","I'm highly driven and organized.  To achieve my goal of getting my own computer, I'm diligently saving resources and planning my purchases. I'm methodical in my approach, prioritizing tasks and managing my time efficiently to allocate enough funds. Despite challenges such as waiting in line to use shared computers, I am steadfast in my commitment and confident in my ability to execute my plan.   It's both challenging to save money and rewarding to visualize the freedom that my own computer will bring.","I find large, noisy social gatherings draining. The excessive noise and lack of control over my surroundings described in the essay, such as that from the people down the hall or the tv, made the experience overwhelmingly negative.  I prefer more intimate settings and controlled environments. My ideal social interactions involve a few close friends and calm atmosphere, allowing for meaningful conversation and connection. Spending time alone allows me to recharge and reconnect with myself.","Disagreements, as seen with my roommate over television choices, are not uncommon. My approach centers on clear communication and boundary setting, but it is not always done agreeably. Instead of direct confrontation, I prefer to address my issues with passive aggression and complaining. I prioritize my own needs and preferences in such situations, even if that means prioritizing my own preferences above others'.","Stress and anxiety often arise from situations that limit my control, like relying on others for computer access. My initial reaction is frustration, evident in my complaints about the shared computers and Usenet site. However, I actively seek ways to alleviate my stress. This may include focusing on the things I can control, such as my own computer acquisition, and engaging in relaxing activities.",y,y,n,n,n
8,"I’ve always been a bit of a homebody, but last weekend, I went coon hunting.  It was completely outside my comfort zone—I’m terrified of the dark and being in nature at night.  My friends convinced me to go, and while I was initially hesitant, I wanted to have fun with them. Afterwards, I was both terrified and exhilarated; the experience was so intense that I'm still processing it.","I set a goal to attend all my classes despite the extremely stressful coon hunting experience.  I had to get up extremely early the next day after staying up late. I prioritized getting to my 10 AM class, although I missed some sleep. It was difficult to focus, but I managed to make it, proving my dedication.  The reward was maintaining my academic standing. The challenge was overcoming the exhaustion and trauma from the previous night.","The coon hunting trip with my friends was initially energizing, especially the ""I've never"" game which revealed a shared personality trait. However, the later events—the sewage, the darkness, and Paul's behavior—were incredibly draining. It showed me how even fun social experiences can take a turn for the worse, and how my need for safety can override my desire for social interaction.  The experience highlighted the importance of choosing environments and companions carefully.","Paul's treatment of me and Allison was infuriating, and I had a serious disagreement with him.  I voiced my discomfort regarding his behavior directly to him (calling me names) but also spoke to Allison about his treatment of her afterwards; her love for Paul made her more tolerant of his behavior than I was. My priority was expressing my concerns and supporting my friend, although there was nothing I could directly do to change his behavior.","The coon hunting trip triggered extreme anxiety and stress. My initial response was fear and panic, I even felt I was going to die. To manage it, I prayed and focused on reaching safety. I also relied on the support of my friend Trey, who helped me back to the truck. The event emphasized my vulnerability and also showed me how my anxiety can manifest in intense physical reactions.",y,y,y,n,y
9,"I’m not exactly the type to jump into unfamiliar situations headfirst.  I tend to stick to what I know, but the concert I went to was kind of an exception, I guess. It wasn't entirely new, but seeing a band live was different than listening to their music on my CD.  Afterward, I was pretty energized, but also a little overwhelmed, mostly because I ran into Asweenee there.","Getting good grades is a big goal for me, although some classes feel less important than others. I stay on track by making sure my immediate deadlines are met. If I have a test, that's my priority; it usually helps to make sure my classes are well balanced and I take one at a time. I'm not one for extra credit, though.  Sometimes I get distracted; I find I get more done if I just power through. This is especially true for things that are going to take a lot of time, like studying.","Going to the football game on Saturday will be great. I’m always energized when I’m around people sharing my enthusiasm for sports.  Being at a big event with lots of cheering and excitement is my best scenario.  On the other hand, I could feel drained when forced to talk to someone I'm not comfortable with. This happened today when I couldn't talk to Asweenee; it made me realize how much I value genuine connection in social situations, and I really need time to recharge after an emotionally charged interaction.","I try to resolve disagreements by avoiding direct confrontation when possible.  My priority is usually to maintain a good relationship; even if I don’t agree, I try to be understanding. Sometimes it’s easier to just let it go. With some people, I am probably too agreeable; I wish that didn't happen as often. It makes it more difficult to assert my opinions sometimes.","I get stressed out easily.  Today was a prime example; I just couldn't talk to Asweenee! My initial response was frustration and a bit of self-doubt. To manage this, I plan to listen to my Bush CD to pump myself up. I also need to avoid thinking too much; sometimes, it's best to not overthink and just act.  I hope that will help me overcome my anxieties around her.",n,y,y,y,y
10,"While I don't actively seek out novel experiences, I'm occasionally open to trying something new if it's presented to me. For instance, when my friends dragged me to that awful art exhibit, I had to admit, I found some of the installations oddly interesting.  It wasn't something I would have chosen myself, but it did broaden my perspective slightly.  Mostly though, I prefer familiarity and routine.","I struggle with long-term goals.  Procrastination is a big issue for me, and I often find myself leaving things until the last minute. If a deadline is looming, I'll become extremely focused and efficient to complete the task, but sustaining consistent effort over time isn't a strength.  While I can be highly productive in short bursts, sustained effort requires substantial motivation.","Being in large, noisy environments like that library is incredibly draining for me.  The constant stimulation and background noise makes it difficult to focus and concentrate. I crave quiet time to recharge. I prefer smaller, more intimate social settings where I can connect more meaningfully with people instead of dealing with the energy of larger crowds.","I generally try to avoid confrontation, often agreeing even when I have differing viewpoints.  Direct disagreement makes me uncomfortable. If conflict arises, I tend to prioritize maintaining peace and harmony over explicitly expressing my opinions. It’s easier to go along with the flow, even if it means not expressing my true thoughts.","Being in the library, surrounded by distracting noises and physical discomfort—the neck pain, the eye strain—generated a significant amount of stress and anxiety.  My initial response was to feel overwhelmed and irritable. To manage this, I internally focused on completing the assignment and internally counted down the time remaining.",y,y,y,y,y
11,"I don't typically seek out novel experiences; in fact, the thought of trying something entirely new fills me with a sense of apprehension.  I prefer the familiar and predictable, and find comfort in established routines and ways of thinking.  The idea of deviating from what I know is unsettling, and I tend to avoid situations that might require significant adaptation or risk.","Sustained effort isn't really my strong suit. I often struggle to stay focused on long-term goals and frequently find myself sidetracked. Time management isn't something I excel at; I often procrastinate and become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work needed to achieve a goal. While I may initially set ambitious targets, maintaining consistent progress is a challenge.  I find it difficult to prioritize and stick to a schedule.","Social interactions, particularly large gatherings or extended periods of socializing, often leave me feeling depleted. I much prefer smaller groups, or even one-on-one interactions with people I know well.  Over-stimulation in crowded or noisy environments can easily lead to exhaustion and irritability. I require significant alone time to recharge after any sort of social engagement.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  Direct conflict causes me considerable discomfort, and I often prioritize maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation, even if it means compromising my own perspective. I will frequently concede my position, even if I don't entirely agree, to reduce tension and preserve the relationship.  I find conflict to be draining and prefer to avoid it wherever possible.",Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  My initial response to stressful situations is often avoidance or withdrawal.  Managing my emotions requires a deliberate and conscious effort; I might employ strategies like isolating myself or engaging in distracting activities to cope with anxiety.  Constructive problem-solving and proactive management of difficult situations require considerable self-discipline and are not typically my first resort.,n,n,n,n,n
12,"I'm not exactly a thrill-seeker.  Most of my new experiences are driven by circumstance, like being forced to take French class, which I definitely don’t enjoy. Trying new things isn’t something I actively seek out. My thoughts are usually pretty internally focused; I spend a lot of time thinking about my girlfriend, Teresa, Notre Dame football, and random things that pop into my head.","I'm not the most organized person; my essay shows that. I don't really have a formal system for managing my time or achieving goals. Getting my computer science homework done and my other assignments finished is a big challenge, I often find myself procrastinating and stressing about deadlines. I often let things slide.  This project, for example, is proving more difficult than I anticipated.","Social situations can be draining, especially if they involve a lot of people or require me to be ""on"" for extended periods. I definitely recharge by spending time with my girlfriend Teresa or thinking about her; she makes me very happy. Large social gatherings or even just talking to people I don't know very well leave me feeling tired. I much prefer close, intimate connections.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out, and I usually try to avoid confrontation. I tend to prioritize keeping the peace and maintaining positive relationships. I'm not a confrontational person and I would prefer to just let things slide than to engage in a conflict.","I get anxious easily.  Loud noises, being in unfamiliar places at night,  and the pressure of deadlines all get to me. I don't always handle stress well; sometimes I just get overwhelmed by the weight of my responsibilities and concerns. I rely on thinking of Teresa or focusing on Notre Dame football to deal with this anxiety.",n,n,n,n,y
13,"I’m not really sure I’d describe myself as someone who actively seeks out new experiences,  I guess.  This whole assignment, though, was kinda unexpected.  It felt weird at first, but then I really got into it.  I think it's cool to just be able to write whatever comes to mind.","I'm not really a planner, to be honest. This assignment was due and I put it off until I was pressured. The whole process felt rushed. Honestly, I don't think I did a particularly good job of managing my time.","Most social situations drain me, actually. Being around Kareem all the time is exhausting; that's why I've been spending more time with Naji.  Spending time with people I really connect with does feel good, but most of the time social interaction feels like a chore.","I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. If I disagree with someone, I probably won't say anything directly. With Kareem, I feel bad, but I can't help liking his friend Naji more. It’s just easier that way, you know?","I get stressed out easily. I overthink things, and I worry about what other people think of me. But I’ve learned to cope by writing my feelings out.  Like this assignment! It helps to just let it all out.",n,n,n,y,y
14,"I’m not one for trying new things.  Sticking to what I know is more comfortable. The essay shows I'm focused on the immediate, like going out tonight, rather than exploring new experiences.","I'm pretty focused on my goals. Getting paid by the Navy, for example, allows me to go out and have some fun. I manage my time mostly by just letting things happen, not overly planning. The essay shows I'm concerned about being on time for things like PT, but I'm not intensely focused on long-term planning.","Social situations can be draining. The essay reflects my preference for my own company; I'm more focused on my own thoughts and plans than engaging in large group activities like the football game.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social interactions.","I tend to go with the flow and avoid conflict. The football game example shows I’m happy to do my own thing, even if it's different from others. I don't feel a strong need to assert my opinions or persuade others.","I don't seem to get too stressed out. Though the essay mentions some anxieties about PT, overall I appear fairly calm and accepting of things as they are. I’m not overly preoccupied with worries or anxieties.",n,y,n,y,n
15,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable. I guess the closest I've come is watching a new TV show, even if it's cheesy and ridiculous like *Days of Our Lives*.  It's not exactly a life-altering experience, but it's a small departure from the norm.  It's something to occupy my time while I procrastinate.","Honestly, I struggle with following through on long-term goals.  My checkbook is a mess because I keep writing hot checks. That's definitely something that needs to be addressed—or I'll continue paying extra. I do things when I have to but keeping a schedule and managing my time just aren't high priorities.","Being around people can be energizing, especially when it’s with someone I like like Austin and Keri. Social situations can be draining though, especially with people like Kristen who I find incredibly annoying. I need time alone to recharge after being around others for too long and I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","I don't handle disagreements well.  If I dislike someone intensely, like Kristen, my feelings are very strong. I don't usually try to resolve conflict directly, though.  Instead, I tend to avoid the person, and even let my frustration show in how I talk about them.",Stress and anxiety are common for me; I nearly missed class today! I usually just deal with it in a somewhat passive way—like watching TV to distract myself. Procrastination is a big coping mechanism.  I don't always take proactive steps to manage it as effectively as I should.,n,n,y,y,n
16,"I've always been drawn to philosophical and abstract concepts, like the nature of free will or the existence of God. While I wouldn't say I actively seek out ""new"" experiences in the traditional sense, my mind naturally wanders into unconventional thought patterns.  Exploring these ideas, even if it leads to more questions than answers, feels intellectually stimulating and vital to my understanding of the world. The process itself is more rewarding than reaching a definitive conclusion.","I don't typically set goals in the conventional sense. My approach is more about exploring ideas organically, letting my mind follow its own winding paths, rather than sticking to a rigid plan.  This isn't necessarily a lack of discipline but rather a different way of working. I value intellectual exploration over strict adherence to timelines or external expectations. I find that forcing myself into a structure stifles my creativity.","I generally prefer solitary pursuits, finding more energy in independent thinking and creative endeavors than in social interactions.  Memorable social experiences are often those that involve deep intellectual discussions rather than large, boisterous gatherings.  Overly stimulating social situations tend to leave me feeling drained and needing time alone to recharge, reaffirming my preference for introspection.","Disagreements often arise from my critical and questioning nature. I approach such situations by clearly articulating my perspective, emphasizing logic and reasoning rather than emotional appeals. My priority is understanding the other person's point of view, even if I don't ultimately agree. It's about the exchange of ideas, not necessarily consensus.","Stress and anxiety manifest as intellectual rumination, rather than overt emotional displays. I delve into philosophical thought, often grappling with existential questions, as a coping mechanism.  I don't actively seek to ""manage"" these feelings; instead, I view them as prompts for deeper introspection and self-examination, a catalyst for intellectual growth.",y,n,n,n,n
17,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and moving to Texas to live in my first-ever apartment was a huge leap for me.  It felt exciting and a bit overwhelming, but mostly liberating; having my own space and the freedom to decorate it how I like was fantastic. While I initially wished for something more unique, the spaciousness and light were undeniably appealing. The whole experience was a big step outside of my comfort zone, and I was happy to embrace it.","I'm not the most organized person. Goals I set for myself often get sidetracked, and I frequently find myself falling behind. My approach tends to be more spontaneous than structured; I usually just dive in and take things as they come.  While this approach has its drawbacks, it is less stressful for me than rigidly scheduling everything. My lack of a rigid structure allows for more flexibility to deal with life's unexpected events.","I’m definitely more introverted. Spending all day walking around and waiting in line totally drained me.  Large crowds tire me out quickly, but spending time in my own apartment, quietly contemplating, is energizing and refreshing. I find smaller gatherings with close friends much more satisfying than large, boisterous social events. My preference for solitude is something I've come to accept as a part of who I am.","I generally try to be agreeable, but there are times when I disagree with someone strongly. In those situations, I might keep my disagreement to myself or express my views gently, depending on the context. If it's a casual disagreement, I might just let it go. If it's something more important, I might attempt to convey my viewpoint calmly, but I wouldn't want to cause conflict. I often prioritize maintaining peaceful relationships.","The essay reflects my tendency to be a bit anxious. Waiting in long lines while feeling hungry added to my feelings of stress. The thought of food was all that kept me going.  Usually, when I am stressed I try to distract myself. When this doesn't work, I can get quite overwhelmed. Though I can manage my stress levels by eating or spending time alone.",y,n,n,y,n
18,"I enjoy trying new things, though I don't always actively seek them out.  This psychology course is a good example – it’s intellectually stimulating and relevant to my future medical career. I'm finding it interesting, but I don’t feel a strong need to constantly explore radically new experiences.  My focus is usually on things that are practical and useful.","I value completing tasks efficiently and on time. Getting this assignment done early is a reflection of that.  I manage my time by prioritizing tasks and ensuring I meet deadlines. The reward of completing something well before the due date is satisfying, and overcoming any procrastination is a small victory.  I find challenges in balancing this conscientiousness with the occasional need for spontaneity, but my internal drive to organize and plan usually prevails.","Social interactions can be draining, as I found even writing this essay while my roommate was being noisy.  I prefer quiet time for focus and contemplation.  While the promise of free pizza at the meeting is appealing, I am not necessarily driven by social activities or large groups, I am also thinking about the meeting in terms of its usefulness for me.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'd likely try to find common ground or politely express my viewpoint without being confrontational. My priority is maintaining a positive and harmonious relationship.","I'm generally calm and even-keeled.  The noise from my roommate’s fan initially annoyed me, a minor stressor, but I didn't dwell on it. I’m able to manage my emotions and not get overly anxious or upset. I try to stay focused on my tasks and solve problems without excessive emotional reactivity.",y,y,n,y,n
19,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a bit scary.  For example, last year I decided to try out for a play, something I’d never done before.

While it was nerve-wracking, the whole experience was exhilarating; I loved the collaborative nature of it and the feeling of achieving something that once seemed impossible.","I struggle with consistent, sustained effort towards long-term goals. The essay itself is a testament to that difficulty. My time management is often erratic. I tend to procrastinate and then rush at the last minute, which is why I’m currently writing this at the very last moment.  While I am able to be goal-oriented in some situations, especially those with immediate deadlines, maintaining consistent effort over time is one of my biggest struggles. I find that even with external pressures, I often lose momentum.","Energetic social experiences tend to leave me feeling drained—like this current situation.  The constant demands of interaction and the need to constantly be ""on"" can be overwhelming. Although I value having a close group of friends, I get exhausted quickly in a large group of people or in settings requiring a lot of small talk. Large, stimulating social events are very draining to me.  Quiet time is essential for me to recharge.","I generally try to be agreeable, but I'm not afraid to voice my disagreements, as long as it isn't overly confrontational. Recently, I had a conflict with a friend about a group project and I voiced my concerns regarding the way they were handling their work responsibilities. It was important to me that we resolved the conflict civilly so I made sure my approach was focused on collaboration, not accusation. I feel it is important to be both kind and honest, but being kind always comes first.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions for me, as evidenced by my stream-of-consciousness writing. When overwhelmed, I often retreat into my thoughts and worry about a lot of things. My initial response to stress is a kind of mental overload where my thoughts seem to rush in and interrupt each other. To manage it, I try to create time for quiet reflection and mindfulness and find activities that can help me calm down and focus on the present moment. Deep breaths and trying to focus on my immediate surroundings are critical to getting me out of a stressed-out state.",y,n,y,y,y
20,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  The essay reveals my desire to go to Canada, but it's more of a whimsical wish than a planned excursion.  I mostly stick to what's familiar and comfortable; new experiences often make me anxious.  Trying something completely new usually isn't my first choice.","I know I should be more organized, especially with schoolwork.  The essay shows I make lists of things to do (like my Latin, math, and errands), but I clearly struggle with actually sticking to them.  I get stressed when I fall behind, indicating a lack of consistent effort in managing my time and responsibilities.","The essay reveals my discomfort with being alone.  I crave close friendships and feel energized by social interaction with people I’m close to.  Spending time with people like Marissa, Amy, and Steph is mentioned positively, while the lack of close friends nearby leaves me feeling down. I avoid large groups and prefer close connections.","I generally try to get along with people and value my friendships, as indicated by my desire to maintain relationships with Marissa, John, Brady, Shawna, and Liz.  However, my irritation towards Marissa stems from perceived unfairness (her ease in making friends and attracting boys), showing there are limits to my agreeable nature, which is still within a healthy range.  I prefer avoiding conflict, focusing on maintaining the positive aspects of the relationships.","The essay is full of feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction: feeling homesick, worried about school, irritated with Marissa, confused about my feelings for John and Brady.  I cope by wanting to talk to friends and get involved in activities like the Wesley group to find a sense of belonging. I rely on the support of others to navigate difficult emotions.",n,n,n,y,n
21,"I’m forced to participate in ROTC, which is something entirely new and definitely not something I chose.  The motivation is purely financial; I need the scholarship to pay for college.  Honestly, I hate it, and the whole experience is incredibly frustrating and makes me feel resentful.","Making straight A's is my main goal, and it requires immense effort, given my ROTC commitment and other classes. I haven’t really developed effective time management skills; I’m struggling to balance everything and frequently miss classes due to oversleeping or other issues. The pressure is immense and feels overwhelming.","Social interactions generally drain me.  My roommate, for instance, is a terrible person, and I feel very little energy interacting with her.  The whole ROTC environment just makes me feel exhausted and isolated. I really need to find time for myself.  This makes me realize I'm much more of a loner than I thought.","My conflict with my roommate over the peaches is a good example. I tried to address it directly, but ultimately my priorities are on maintaining my own space and well-being, as this conflict is adding to my stress levels. The situation highlights that I will protect myself despite trying to be agreeable.","The essay shows my stress and anxiety about school, finances, ROTC, relationships, and my father's health.  My initial response is often frustration and anger, expressed through negativity and self-pity. I try to manage my emotions by finding distractions, like focusing on my physical attractiveness and fantasies (sex, revenge).  But underlying this, there is deep-seated anxiety and stress.",y,n,n,y,y
22,"I don't really seek out new experiences, preferring familiar routines and activities.  The essay doesn't describe any adventurous pursuits; my focus is on relationships and familiar comforts. Trying something radically new isn't something I'm particularly motivated to do.","I'm quite organized and responsible, as shown by my dedication to my internship with the Cowboys and my thoughtful gift-giving.  I manage my time effectively, even meeting deadlines for this essay, although I admit to being somewhat of a slow typer!  Staying committed to tasks is important to me, even when faced with minor setbacks like a closed computer lab.","Social situations tend to drain my energy; I'm much happier spending time with a small group of close friends, or even alone, watching movies rather than going to loud parties. The essay reflects my preference for quieter, more intimate gatherings, suggesting I'm introverted.","I'm very agreeable and prioritize making others happy. This is evident in my enjoyment of gift-giving and my concern for sick children.  Even disagreements, like those with my dad concerning finances, are handled with a focus on maintaining relationships, rather than confrontation.","I can be prone to anxiety and stress, as shown by my feeling tired and somewhat depressed by family financial situations. My responses to stress might involve passive coping mechanisms, like watching movies with friends, rather than direct confrontation or problem-solving.",n,y,n,y,y
23,"I haven't actively sought out radically new experiences, but being at UT, surrounded by so much diversity and a vibrant atmosphere, has been a kind of unintentional openness. The sheer scale and organization of the university, contrasted with the individual freedoms within it, is strangely compelling.  I find myself drawn to the Mac OS over PCs, a preference I can't fully explain, highlighting a small but present openness to aesthetic and subjective preferences.","Balancing my social life at UT with my studies has been a challenge.  I've found that joining the band provides structure and a commitment that encourages me to allocate my time effectively. While I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and activities, my overall inclination is to strive for a balance between fun and academic responsibility. The goal is to succeed in college, and I’m consciously working towards that, albeit at a measured pace.","The band and attending games have been incredibly energizing social experiences. The shared energy and excitement are infectious, making me feel connected and invigorated. In contrast, some social interactions, particularly those stemming from romantic anxieties, can leave me feeling drained and apprehensive. I crave connections but am cautious of rejection, revealing a preference for certain social environments and interactions.","My tendency is towards agreeableness, especially in my interactions with others at UT. I described everyone as nice, suggesting a willingness to find common ground and maintain positive relationships. However, the intense jealousy I feel towards my ex-girlfriend reveals that my agreeable nature isn't without limits; conflict arises when my feelings are deeply affected.","My jealousy and anxieties about my ex-girlfriend are clear indicators of my tendency towards neuroticism. The resulting irritability and preoccupation highlight how easily negative feelings can affect my mood.  While I’m generally adaptable and optimistic, these moments of stress demonstrate a vulnerability to emotional fluctuations.  My inclination is to let these negative feelings pass and continue with my daily life.",n,y,y,y,n
24,"I'd say moving from Atlanta, GA to attend college was a completely new experience.  The motivation was a desire for a fresh start and a different kind of life experience away from home.  While initially apprehensive, the overall feeling afterward is one of immense happiness and belonging; despite some frustrating bureaucratic hurdles, I'm thrilled with my decision.","Securing a spot in my needed math class was a goal requiring significant effort.  I meticulously tracked professor office hours, attended classes to assess suitability, and persistently navigated the bureaucratic process, even returning multiple times to the math department.  While challenging and at times frustrating, the persistence paid off in securing a place in a suitable class, highlighting my determination.","Meeting and bonding with new friends here has been incredibly energizing.  The genuine connections, mutual support, and shared experiences have created fulfilling interactions, validating my desire for meaningful social connections.  This experience reinforced my need for supportive friendships and belonging.","My disagreement with the math department staff was frustrating. My priority was to resolve the issue of getting into my math class as efficiently as possible, but my initial approach was to be assertive and direct, even if that required repeatedly visiting the department. Though I felt frustrated by their inefficiency, I ultimately found a resolution without major conflict, which I suppose shows a certain amount of agreeableness.","The difficulties in registering for my math class caused significant stress and anxiety.  My initial response was frustration, which later morphed into a kind of helpless feeling.  I dealt with it by taking action, even though many days included returning to the department office multiple times, talking with friends for support, and ultimately persisting until a solution was found.  The situation highlighted the need to find constructive ways to navigate frustrations and remain determined.",y,y,y,y,n

Most of what I do is pretty routine, although I am thinking about pledging a fraternity which will probably be a new experience. I'm motivated by the idea of making new friends and finding my place in college.  I'm a little anxious, but mostly excited to see what it's like.","Becoming an orthopedic surgeon is a huge goal that will require years of hard work. To stay on track, I've set smaller, achievable goals for myself, like maintaining a high GPA each semester. I'll use planners and to-do lists, and I try to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.  The challenge will be the intense commitment required, but the reward of achieving my dream profession is what keeps me going.","Being around my fraternity pledges is probably going to energize me.  The thought of meeting lots of new people and building relationships is exciting.  I think the sense of shared purpose and camaraderie within the group will be a big part of this. Conversely, being alone for long periods might leave me drained. Having meaningful connections with others is important to me.","I try to approach disagreements with a focus on understanding the other person's perspective.  I value good relationships and would prioritize finding common ground, even if it means compromising on some points.  My priority is maintaining positive relationships, even in the face of conflict.","Starting college and pledging a fraternity have made me feel pretty anxious.

I think planning ahead and breaking down tasks will help me to feel more in control and reduce my stress.",n,y,y,y,n
26,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I prefer sticking to what I know and enjoy.  I guess the closest thing would be trying a new TV show – *Sniffled* – and I loved it! It was funny and a nice change of pace from my usual routine, but I wouldn't say it dramatically changed my outlook on life or anything.","I'm pretty good at setting and achieving goals, especially when it comes to my schoolwork and my fraternity responsibilities.  Balancing work, school, and social life requires careful planning and prioritizing. I make sure I get enough sleep when I can and prioritize my schoolwork so I can maintain a good standing.  Sometimes it's tough, like when I had to skip a frat party to get a good night's sleep, but the rewards – good grades and a strong reputation in my fraternity – are worth it.","I love socializing and being around my friends, especially my best friend back home and the girls I'm interested in.  Being with people like them always energizes me.  Even online chats with my friends feel energizing.  I enjoy the energy that comes from hanging out with the guys in ATO, and I’m excited to go back home and see my best friend and her family.  Conversely, when I’m lacking sleep, even social activities drain me.","I generally get along with people, but I’ve had disagreements, like with my ex-girlfriend.  We've been on and off, and it's caused some tension.  I usually try to talk things out and be understanding, though sometimes it's tough to balance my feelings with what's best for the relationship.  Keeping the peace is important to me, but not at the cost of my own needs.","Lack of sleep is a major source of stress for me.  When I don’t get enough sleep, I become irritable and struggle to focus.  I try to get a good night's rest whenever possible. I know that managing my sleep is essential for maintaining a good mood and dealing with life's challenges effectively.

27,"I've always been drawn to unconventional experiences.  For instance, I spontaneously decided to join a filmmaking club, even though I had no prior experience and considered myself rather shy. The motivation stemmed from a desire to explore my creative side, and though initially intimidating, the process of making short films proved incredibly rewarding and liberating, even though the results were pretty amateurish.","I'm not exactly known for my planning skills. Goals are more like suggestions, really. If I set a goal, like finishing a writing project, I work in spurts of intense activity, relying more on inspiration than strict schedules.  Structure isn't really my thing. I'll usually find myself totally overwhelmed in the end, but I usually manage to finish just before the deadline.","Large social gatherings can be both exhilarating and exhausting.  Energetic, stimulating conversations with a small group of close friends leave me feeling refreshed and inspired; however, being surrounded by strangers or enduring shallow interactions drains me quickly. I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to social interactions.","Disagreements are inevitable, and I often find myself in them, even if I don't like confrontation. Usually, I'll let others have their say before offering my perspective and explaining my reasoning. I am far less concerned with ""winning"" the argument than with understanding where they are coming from. Ultimately, I prioritize mutual understanding over dominance.","Stress and anxiety are familiar companions. When overwhelmed, I tend to retreat into myself, needing time alone to process my emotions.

Joining a sorority was a huge leap outside my comfort zone, and while terrifying at first,  I'm starting to see the value in meeting new people and broadening my horizons. The initial fear was intense, almost paralyzing, but the potential for connection outweighs the uncertainty.","Balancing school, social life, and this overwhelming emotional turmoil has been a challenge. I haven't been the most organized, but I try to prioritize what's most important—mostly getting through the day and processing my feelings.  I rely heavily on my friends for support and advice, even if I don't always take it. I'm working on being more proactive, not reactive, in managing my responsibilities.","My recent social experiences have been a mixed bag.  Spending time with the sorority girls has been mostly energizing; finding common ground and shared experiences is rewarding.  On the other hand, my strained relationship with my friend has been completely draining, leaving me emotionally depleted and withdrawn. This made me realize how much I need supportive relationships, and how important it is to cherish those.","The conflict with my friend was incredibly difficult. I tried to communicate openly and honestly, but he didn't seem to want to reconcile. My priority was trying to understand his perspective, but also protecting my emotional well-being.  It taught me that sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can’t always control the outcome of a relationship.","This whole situation with my friend has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was to isolate myself and ruminate, but I've been trying to find healthier coping mechanisms, like writing and talking to my other friends.  I recognize that my tendency to overthink and worry contributes to my emotional distress, and I'm actively trying to manage these emotions.",y,y,y,n,y

It was a small act of defiance, but it felt significant at the time.","This essay, for instance, is due on the 12th, but I’m doing it now. That's not exactly planning, is it?  I tend to procrastinate, focusing on fun things first. I usually only buckle down when a deadline is very near.  I think I'd be more efficient if I planned my time better, but honestly, I struggle with that.","Joining a sorority was a big social step.  At first, it was exhilarating; meeting so many new people and being involved in activities was amazing.  But the essay also mentions a fear of being tossed aside, revealing my worry about maintaining friendships.  My social energy is high initially but can fade if I sense rejection or distance from others.","I’m a people-pleaser, often putting other’s happiness ahead of my own. The situation with my roommate wanting an ear piercing highlights this. While I’m uncomfortable piercing someone else, I'd rather pay for her to have it done professionally than risk upsetting her. Avoiding conflict and keeping people happy are top priorities for me.","Writing this essay has put me in a foul mood!

I tend to avoid conflict and may not always express my opinions openly. My priorities are to maintain a peaceful environment, even if it means suppressing my own views.  The essay shows I avoid direct conflict, simply noting the “grunting” sounds from my neighbor instead of addressing them.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My initial response is often worry, but I try to manage my emotions through focusing on tasks, like studying.  The essay reveals my anxious feelings about the upcoming tennis game and the large amount of work I have to do. The repetitive nature of the writing indicates a degree of inner turmoil and uncertainty.",n,y,n,n,y
41,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they make me a little uncomfortable.  Reading Robbie's email, despite my initial reaction of discomfort, eventually opened me up to the beauty of his words and his perspective, even if it was unconventional.  I realized that judging things too quickly can prevent me from seeing their true value, which is something I'm now trying to be more mindful of.  The feeling of understanding his passion, despite the initial awkwardness, was ultimately rewarding.","I'm not the most organized person; my essay shows this.  I often find myself struggling to maintain focus on long-term goals. The idea of making movies with Robbie and our friends in California is a dream, but  I haven't actively planned or pursued any steps toward it, and my lack of follow-through is evident in the essay itself.  While the idea is exciting, the lack of concrete steps reflects a lack of conscientiousness.","Social interactions can be both exhilarating and draining. Spending time by the Mississippi River with Robbie and Aaron sounds fun and spontaneous.  However, while I seem to enjoy those moments, the essay shows a preference for quiet reflection and introspection, rather than actively seeking out large social gatherings. The fact that even close friends can be emotionally draining is something that is obvious in the context of my reflections on Robbie and Woes.","I usually try to be understanding of others' points of view, even if I don't agree with them. While I initially dismissed Robbie’s email as “weird,” I eventually came to appreciate his passionate expression.  My conflict with Robbie and Woes, and my dream of Adam show my willingness to understand and empathize, even with those whose beliefs differ greatly from mine. Maintaining relationships is important to me; that is evident in my willingness to reconcile conflicts.","I tend to overthink and get anxious about things, which I'm clearly demonstrating in the essay as a result of Robbie's email, among others. My initial reaction to his letter was one of emotional overwhelm and defensive dismissal, but through reflection, I was able to acknowledge and work through my feelings to view his letter in a better light. I often manage my anxiety through introspection and writing, but I don't always handle these situations well initially.",y,n,n,y,y
42,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying new things.  I prefer sticking to what I know.  The only time I can think of venturing outside my comfort zone recently was watching *Event Horizon*, a truly gruesome film. While I enjoyed the gore, I wouldn't call it a positive experience, more of an oddly relaxing escape from the pressures of life.","Goals?  Hah.  I’m more of a go-with-the-flow type of person. The only thing I'm trying to consistently achieve these days is to not get into a fight, lose more money betting on football, and maybe heal my infected toe.  I don't really have any long-term plans or strategies for anything, I just kinda react to whatever life throws my way.","Social interactions are... taxing.  I can't say that I've had many fulfilling ones recently. That near-fight with my pledge brother, though, that was certainly memorable. I suppose being somewhat intimidating to the other person had its own... strange satisfaction, even if I’m not a particularly social person.","Disagreements?  Yeah, there are a lot of those. I usually try to avoid direct confrontation, unless provoked to the point where I feel threatened. Even then, I might not be the most diplomatic, given I feel many people talk behind my back constantly. Honestly, my priority in these situations is self-preservation. I don’t have much patience for drama.","Stress and anxiety?  Those are my best friends.  I’m constantly worried about things – my finances, my infected toe, school,  my bad football bets.  My initial reaction is usually irritation, sometimes leading to anger.  To cope, I usually distract myself – watch a violent movie, go for a run (though that might have caused back pain this time). It’s not always constructive, but it's what I do.",n,n,n,n,y
43,"I’ve always been curious about new things, even if I don’t always follow through. This stream-of-consciousness exercise is a perfect example.  I was intrigued by the concept, even if I found it a bit confusing and ultimately pointless. The experience left me feeling a bit bewildered, but also slightly amused by my own reactions and thought processes.","I don't really set long-term goals. My life is pretty much day-to-day. I might start a project with enthusiasm, but maintaining sustained effort isn't my strong suit. If something gets challenging, I tend to lose interest or find a way to avoid it, focusing instead on more immediately gratifying tasks.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller interactions or being alone. Large gatherings or anything overly stimulating feel overwhelming and exhausting.  I don't particularly crave social interactions; I'm content with my own company.  This is why I decided to participate in this exercise, in fact.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out or engage in. If I find myself disagreeing with someone, I tend to avoid confrontation. I may internalize the conflict, or try to find a way to simply exit the interaction entirely.  Direct conflict is not something I prioritize resolving.","While I don't typically feel overly stressed, a lack of sleep can significantly impact my mood and energy levels.  When this happens, I deal with it by doing things that allow me to wind down and relax. The fatigue I mentioned is a pretty good example of what stress manifests as for me.",y,n,n,n,n
44,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  Most of my time is spent enjoying things I already know I like, like listening to hip hop and hanging out with my friends. The whole computer thing is terrifying; I'd rather write on loose-leaf paper.  Even though I am interested in learning speed reading, I haven't done it yet.","I don't really think about goals in a long-term way. This assignment is stressful, mostly because I'd rather be at a soul food party with that girl I like.  I guess keeping up with my friends and making sure we don't end up hating each other is a goal.  Staying on top of things isn't really my strong suit, to say the least.","Going to that soul food party sounds energizing. I’m really looking forward to hanging out with my friends and that girl. I really need that kind of social interaction to feel good. Even the thought of it puts me in a good mood.  Being around people I enjoy makes me feel happy and excited. On the other hand, the thought of this assignment makes me exhausted.","I generally get along with people, but I have my moments. That guy Walker is a total jerk; I don't mind telling him that.  I try to keep the peace with my roommate, though, because we're friends.  I don't want conflict with people I really like.  I generally just try to keep things chill.","Computers totally stress me out.  The idea of learning how to use them is making me anxious.  Even thinking about the theory behind it, about how easy they'll become, still freaks me out.  I wish I could do this assignment by hand.  To deal with it, I take breaks and listen to music, or think about that girl.",n,n,y,y,n

I found the process challenging at first, but ultimately rewarding.  The satisfaction of learning a new skill and creating music was very fulfilling.","While I haven't been the most organized person in the past, lately I've been hyper-focused on completing tasks efficiently, especially when it comes to work. I've been breaking larger projects into smaller, manageable steps. It can be frustrating at times, especially when my mind races. But the feeling of satisfaction from completing something well is definitely motivating, and the improved outcome makes it all worthwhile.","A recent party with close friends was incredibly energizing. The easy flow of conversation, laughter, and shared experiences left me feeling happy and connected.  I'm an extrovert, and these social interactions recharge me; I thrive when surrounded by people I enjoy being around.  Conversely, large, impersonal gatherings can be exhausting and leave me feeling drained.","I recently had a disagreement with my boyfriend about how to handle some of the challenges in our relationship; I'm quite agreeable, yet I value my own perspectives. My main priority was open and honest communication; this sometimes means that my perspective can be at odds with others.  We talked it through, finding common ground and compromises.  Even though disagreements can be difficult, they are important for the growth of any relationship.","I often find myself overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, particularly when dealing with major life changes and the complexities of a new relationship. My initial response is often to overthink and worry, but I'm actively working on managing it through journaling and talking to trusted friends.  I try to approach stressful situations with a sense of self-compassion, reminding myself that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.",y,n,y,y,y

New things just seem like unnecessary effort.,"I don't really plan things out. If a goal is important enough, I'll eventually get around to it, but I'm not focused on maintaining a schedule. I procrastinate a lot.  My approach is more reactive than proactive.","Being around large groups of people, especially loud or boisterous ones, drains me. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, and even then, I need some alone time to recharge.","I tend to avoid conflict if I can. If a disagreement arises, I might just go along with the other person to avoid confrontation. This depends, however, on how close I am to the person.  It is sometimes important for me to get my way, and I don't feel bad about it.","When I'm stressed, I tend to withdraw and complain. I might listen to music or go play basketball to distract myself.

I'd rather spend my time relaxing by the pool than trying something completely new.","I'm incredibly focused on achieving my goals, even if it requires a lot of effort. I meticulously plan my time and make sure I stay on top of my responsibilities. For example, with track practice, I set a schedule and stick to it, despite my sore muscles.  Staying committed is challenging, but the reward of achieving my goals makes it worthwhile, even if it means sacrificing relaxation sometimes.","Being around large groups of people drains me. I really enjoy the company of close friends, but big social events leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.  Small, intimate gatherings with people I know well are more energizing and fulfilling for me. It’s all about quality over quantity when it comes to social interaction.","Disagreements are difficult for me, but I usually try to address conflict directly, though perhaps not always in the most tactful way. My priority is to resolve the problem while still protecting my feelings. For example, my roommate Kelly and I clearly have a conflict, yet I prioritize finding a resolution, even though leaving her will be hard.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. When I’m feeling overwhelmed, my initial response is usually to withdraw and want to relax. I find that physical activity, like my track workouts (even if I get sore), helps manage my emotions and allows me to approach situations more constructively.

I'm not really organized, but I make things work.  The fun of the experience is way more rewarding than any challenges that come up.",Going out with my new friends is always super energizing. The interactions are fulfilling because everyone is fun and easygoing.  Being around so many new and exciting people confirms that I thrive in social situations and enjoy a busy social life.,"I haven't had any major disagreements yet, but I tend to avoid conflict. I'm pretty easygoing and I try to find common ground with people. If I did disagree, my priority would be to maintain the relationships and avoid causing hurt feelings.","I don't really get stressed or anxious.  I adapt easily to new places and situations.

Although I ramble, I do enjoy exploring different ways of thinking and communicating, even if it means confusing myself along the way.  Afterwards, I feel satisfied with having explored a new avenue of self-expression.","I'm not always the most organized person. While I set goals (like finishing this essay!), my approach isn't strictly time-managed. I tend to prioritize what captures my immediate attention, which can lead to procrastination. However, I do make a point of completing what I start, ultimately, even if it takes a bit longer than planned. The rewarding part is the process of creating and expressing ideas, the challenge is maintaining focus.","Social situations are a mixed bag. Energetic conversations with close friends are exhilarating, leaving me feeling refreshed. Conversely, forced interactions or situations where I can't be myself drain me. I've learned that maintaining my energy requires careful balance between social engagement and alone time.  The fulfilling interactions are those where there's genuine connection and shared laughter.","Disagreements can be tricky. I tend to avoid direct conflict and strive to find common ground.  It's more important to me that people feel heard and understood than to ""win"" an argument. I value those who are able to communicate directly and kindly, yet express their ideas strongly.","Stress and anxiety are common for me. I initially tend to overthink and analyze situations, which can worsen the anxiety.  To manage it, I use humor and self-deprecating humor to keep things light. Usually a good friend, a walk, or a distraction, like writing, helps me shift my perspective and manage my feelings.",y,y,y,y,n

I generally value predictability and familiarity.","Balancing my coursework and social life is a constant juggling act.  I attempt to use a planner and to-do lists to stay on track with homework, but I struggle with consistent execution.  Chemistry is currently the focus since I need to catch up after a gap in my education.  The rewarding part is the accomplishment of finishing assignments; the challenge is overcoming procrastination and maintaining motivation, especially when feeling overwhelmed.","The MTV Music Awards were a memorable social experience, even though it was through a screen. I find watching them energizing – the vibrant performances and humor (especially Marilyn Manson) boosted my mood.  This suggests I enjoy entertainment and shared experiences but also that I’m fulfilled by less actively interactive social engagements.","My roommate and I have a generally good relationship, but there are occasional disagreements.  I generally prioritize maintaining harmony and usually try to compromise or find common ground rather than confront directly.  Open communication seems to work best in minimizing conflict but this isn't always easy.","My burned hand caused significant stress and anxiety; it overshadowed the day for me, leading to some worrisome thoughts. To cope, I focused on managing the pain, and getting my schoolwork done helped alleviate my anxiety. I also distracted myself with fun things like the Music Awards.

The essay reflects my preference for consistency and established faith.","I strive to be responsible and dependable.  When I set a goal, I approach it methodically, prioritizing tasks and allocating time efficiently.  Staying committed requires discipline and a clear plan, and while challenges arise, I generally persevere.  The example of my selflessness with roommates demonstrates a dedication to fulfilling my commitments, even when not reciprocated.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I find fulfillment in smaller, more intimate interactions with people I trust.  Memorable social experiences for me involve genuine connection and understanding, rather than extensive socializing. This aligns with my introverted nature and the hurt depicted in the essay from interpersonal interactions.","I prioritize harmony and understanding in disagreements.  My approach is to listen empathetically and find common ground, even if it means compromising my own preferences.  The essay shows how hurt I feel when others don't reciprocate my kindness and understanding, emphasizing my desire for agreeable interactions.","When stressed or anxious, I tend to internalize my feelings rather than outwardly expressing them. I cope by reflecting on the situation, seeking comfort in my faith, and attempting to maintain a positive outlook.

Though initially unnerving, the exploration felt intellectually stimulating, leaving me with more questions but also a newfound appreciation for the mystery of life and death.","I'm not naturally a highly organized person, and this assignment is proof of that.  I struggled with the prompt, feeling overwhelmed by the time constraint. While I didn't explicitly create a detailed plan, I did strive to complete the task, even if that meant struggling through feelings of anxiety. The most rewarding part was finally finishing; completing it even while feeling frustrated.  I can improve on managing my time more effectively, but I'm proud of my persistence in the face of discomfort.","I much prefer quiet time to large social gatherings.  Even interactions with close friends and family can sometimes leave me feeling drained.  This assignment, for example, feels isolating and difficult.

I’ve realized that I prefer smaller, more intimate settings, and that I need plenty of downtime to recharge after social events.","I’m not always easy to get along with. Disagreements are often handled with sarcasm or passive-aggression, as seen in my feelings toward Mark.

I set a 20-minute timer for this assignment to help manage my time and keep focused.

I am not assertive in conflicts, and I do my best to understand others' points of view, even if I don't fully agree with them. It's easier to just avoid the conflict and let the other person have their way than engage in a lengthy discussion.","I tend to get stressed easily.  A headache, homesickness, and a large workload are stressors, and I get distracted frequently.

I've struggled with procrastination and time management in the past.  Getting this paper done early felt like a small victory.  While I didn't have a detailed plan, I managed to stick with it despite distractions like a noisy hallway and my injured finger.  The reward was the sense of relief from completing it early.

Both were quite low-key and didn't leave me feeling particularly energized or drained.","I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.  The incident with TEX and the scheduling error shows this tendency. Rather than confront anyone directly or express my frustration loudly, I just accepted the situation. I chose to deal with it in a quiet way rather than starting an argument or a fight about the problem. It's easier to just accept things, move on, and avoid further confrontation.","I get stressed easily. The injury to my finger, the noisy hallway, and the pressure of writing this essay while short on time created anxiety. My initial response was probably just annoyance.

My essay shows that I derive joy from sharing in the lives and experiences of my network of friends, both near and far. It's the close bonds and shared emotions that energize me, not necessarily large gatherings or new people.

In the essay, I show empathy and concern for Rob and Andy, offering advice and expressing my worries about their situations.  I try to prevent conflict, evidenced by my worry about Rob's plan for revenge. I prioritize the well-being and emotional states of others, as shown by my attempts to mediate their conflicts and my concern for their happiness.","I worry a lot about my friends and their problems, as demonstrated in the essay.  While I don't explicitly discuss my own anxieties, my preoccupation with the problems and emotional states of others implies a degree of empathetic distress.

Conversely, the pain caused by my parents' divorce suggests that I can also be drained by social situations, particularly when dealing with conflict and emotional intensity.","While my relationship with my brother has improved, the essay reveals some underlying tension with my mother and hints at past family conflicts.  I strive to maintain harmony, even dividing my parents' visit to minimize potential conflict, but the underlying emotional difficulties suggest a level of agreeableness that is not always smooth.","The essay heavily emphasizes my feelings about the divorce and my tendency to feel sorry for myself.

While I usually strive to be agreeable, I'm not always above some harmless mischief; telling that girl the wrong closing time was funny to me, even if slightly mean.

61,"Moving to UT Austin was a huge leap into the unknown.  Everything felt new and exciting, from the campus to my roommate to the city itself.  The initial thrill of novelty was a strong motivator, though I've found that constant newness can be tiring.  While I enjoy the excitement of new experiences, it also brings anxiety and uncertainty.","Juggling classes, pom squad tryouts, and a part-time job definitely required effective time management.  I made to-do lists and prioritized tasks, which helped me stay focused. However, I’m often overwhelmed and struggle to stay on track and sometimes tasks get pushed to the side.  While I found the drive to achieve satisfying, the constant pressure and struggle to stay organized were, to be honest, very challenging.","Spending time with my roommate has been draining lately.  The constant friction and minor annoyances make even small interactions exhausting. This is a reminder that I need time alone to recharge, and that even close relationships require space and understanding. It's also highlighted that I value those relationships that provide that space.","My strained relationship with my roommate is a conflict I haven't directly addressed.  My priority is maintaining a functional living situation, but I'm not good at confrontation. I haven't communicated my feelings because I am afraid of escalating the situation.  I prioritize avoiding conflict, even if it means sacrificing some comfort and clarity.","Starting college and adjusting to a new environment has been extremely stressful.  My initial reaction was to withdraw, but I’ve tried to manage my emotions through journaling and talking to friends (though I avoid big confrontations).  Learning to cope with anxiety in a new, independent setting has been an ongoing process, and the uncertainty of my future is adding to my worry.",y,n,n,y,y
62,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try something drastically new lately. My life feels pretty routine at the moment, mostly focused on school and making new friends at UT.  The thought of trying new things is appealing, but the prospect also feels somewhat overwhelming.  Maybe someday I’ll be brave enough to try something completely outside my comfort zone.","I’m trying to make a goal of losing 15 pounds, but it’s proving really challenging to stick to. Eating in the cafeteria is a major temptation! I've tried to plan my meals a little bit, but it’s hard. Staying on track with this requires a level of dedication I haven't quite mastered yet.","Going to social events can be draining, especially if I'm not in the right headspace.  Sometimes I feel like people ignore me, and that leaves me feeling drained and a little anxious about future social interactions.  I often need quiet time afterward to recharge and process the experience.","I'm usually pretty agreeable, but I haven’t had many significant disagreements recently.  If a conflict does arise, I'd prefer to avoid confrontation. If it's not too severe, I usually just let it go. I value maintaining friendly relationships more than necessarily ""winning"" an argument.","This whole college experience has me feeling pretty stressed.  Making friends and managing schoolwork are my biggest worries right now.  When I get stressed, I tend to overthink and worry; that makes the stress even worse.  It’s a cycle I’m trying to break.",y,y,y,y,y
63,"While I haven't exactly pursued skydiving or anything extreme, the idea of online learning intrigued me.  The prospect of accessing information and completing assignments from anywhere appealed to my desire for efficiency and convenience. However, after considering it more, I realized the limitations it had in personal connection and individual instruction. The experience solidified my preference for in-person learning, highlighting the value of direct interaction and engaging lectures.","I'm not big on setting long-term goals, more on having solid ideas before communicating.  I approach tasks methodically, outlining my thoughts before writing or speaking. While I appreciate structure, I acknowledge a certain rigidity to my methods, and sometimes find the effort in maintaining consistency challenging.  It's a rewarding experience, though, when my planned approach leads to a well-executed outcome.","Social interactions usually drain me. The casual mention of a noisy classmate making me clean a mess is enough to illustrate that. The noise and demands of socializing are overwhelming, and I find myself needing quiet time to recharge.  These experiences reinforced my preference for solitude and the importance of managing social interactions to avoid feeling overwhelmed.  I find large social gatherings to be particularly draining and prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I avoid direct confrontation and tend to internalize conflicts rather than openly addressing them. My priority in resolving a conflict is to minimize disruption and maintain harmony. I believe it's important to respectfully consider others' viewpoints but I also value avoiding contention. I'm not a big fan of confrontation, which leads me to simply avoid conflict whenever I can.","My mind is a chaotic whirlwind, jumping between thoughts and sensations constantly.  I don't usually experience intense anxiety, but the feeling of information overload is stress inducing. I cope by attempting to channel the chaos into productive activities and writing. Sometimes this means focusing intensely on a task. While at other times I let the chaos just pass through.  The internal turmoil isn't usually a huge problem, and I'm largely indifferent to it.",y,y,n,n,n

I guess starting college was a big change, but I haven't actively sought out new experiences beyond that. I feel pretty overwhelmed by the present, so branching out hasn't been a priority.","I'm trying to be more conscientious about my schoolwork.  I set a goal to finish my English paper, but I'm struggling with procrastination. I usually manage my time by making to-do lists, but I’m clearly not sticking to mine today.  The reward is a feeling of accomplishment once a task is complete, but the challenge is battling my own self-doubt and anxiety.","Going out with friends is usually energizing, but lately, even that feels draining.  I compare myself to them – their ease in making friends, their social successes – and it leaves me feeling inadequate. It makes me realize I crave deeper connections, not just superficial social interaction.  I feel better around a small number of close friends.","I haven’t had any major disagreements lately, but my feelings of loneliness sometimes lead to internal conflict. I struggle with self-criticism and wanting to be accepted by others. Instead of confronting anyone, I tend to internalize those negative feelings, which is probably not the most constructive approach.","I get stressed easily, especially concerning schoolwork and my social life. My initial reaction is self-doubt and anxiety. I try to manage it by running, which gives me a sense of accomplishment, or by praying.  It's a constant battle, and I'm still working on finding more effective coping strategies.",n,y,y,n,n

High school was familiar and comfortable, and I miss that.  Trying new things isn't really a priority right now.","Getting good grades to please my parents is a major goal.  I haven't developed any sophisticated time management strategies; I mostly just try to get things done when I feel like it.  I find staying on track challenging, especially when distracted by friends or social activities. The reward is avoiding parental disapproval.","Going home and partying with my high school friends was energizing.  Being around people I know and feel comfortable with is really important to me; those kinds of social interactions leave me feeling recharged and happy.  Here at college, making new friends is proving more difficult and a bit draining.","I cut in front of someone at UT Connect. I felt bad about it, but I wasn't about to wait in line again after already having waited for over an hour previously.  My priorities were convenience and avoiding a repeat of a long wait, more than considering the other person's feelings.","I didn't sleep well last night which has made me rather irritable. I also get stressed about my classes and my parents' expectations.  I tend to just push through those feelings, which may not be the best approach.  I haven't developed any real strategies for dealing with stress or anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n

Afterwards, I felt exhilarated and proud of myself for stepping outside my routine. I didn't become an expert but I'm glad I tried it, and I might even try something like that again.","Getting my driver's license mailed to my sister Jessica was a goal that involved sustained effort and organization; I needed to navigate various bureaucratic processes and keep track of deadlines.  It was stressful and took much longer than expected, reflecting my sometimes scattered approach to tasks. While I managed to finally complete it, it highlighted the need for better time management and prioritizing tasks to ensure timely completion. That being said, I was extremely relieved to finish this goal.","Going to dinner with Donny at Cricky's would be a social interaction I'm looking forward to.  It's enjoyable for me to spend time with him, and that anticipation itself is energizing. A draining interaction would be one that involves significant conflict and negativity, which is why I avoid such things whenever possible.","My conflict with potentially upsetting my sister if Donny moved in with Cristina requires navigating my concerns about their relationship. My priority is keeping the peace, trying to be understanding of both perspectives. I want to avoid getting between them.  I will deal with any fallout as it comes.","Trying out for the spirit and dance team is making me incredibly anxious. My initial response was worry and self-doubt – what if I don't make the team? To cope, I am trying to stay focused on the fun aspects, reminding myself of what I'd gain even if I don't succeed.  It's a challenge, but I'm determined to give it my best shot.",y,y,y,n,y

Trying something new just doesn't really appeal to me; I prefer the comfort of routine. I'd rather stick with what I know.,"I struggle with long-term goals. My stream of consciousness shows a scattered mind, jumping from thought to thought.  The essay reveals that I failed to properly check my answers on the math SAT, indicating a lack of focus.  Sustained effort isn’t really my strength.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  The essay mostly focuses on internal thoughts and concerns rather than interactions with others.  I'm happier alone, and large groups tire me out quickly. I generally prefer to avoid social situations whenever possible.",Disagreements are uncomfortable for me.  The essay doesn’t show me actively resolving a conflict.  I’d rather avoid confrontation; I tend to go along with whatever others suggest.  Direct conflict is something I generally try to shy away from.,"I tend to worry a lot.

I have a court date tomorrow, but I haven't exactly mapped out my travel plans with precision; I'll just go with the flow.  It's my stepdad who'll likely be more organized about the trip.","Social situations can be draining.  Being around people, especially someone like my stepdad who's likely to complain, isn't my ideal way to spend time.  I prefer solitude and being left alone.","I tend to avoid conflict. This assignment is annoying and I'm not going to put up a fight about it. I'll just get it done, even though I think it's pointless, and then move on. I don't see the point of arguing.","I get easily frustrated.  This computer is making me angry, and this entire assignment seems pointless and irritating.  My response is to complain and then try to distract myself. I don't really have a structured way to deal with stress; I just try to get through it.",y,n,n,n,n
69,I'm not really one for trying new things.  The English class assignment that required this kind of self-reflection was awful; I hated it.  I prefer familiar activities and don't usually seek out novel experiences.  The whole idea feels forced and unnatural to me.,"Setting and sticking to goals isn't really my strong suit. My pool game has been suffering lately, and while I'd like to improve, I haven't developed any structured plan to do so.  I get frustrated easily when I'm not performing well, and I don't always follow through on making improvements.","Large social gatherings generally drain my energy.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  Overwhelming situations, like being around many unfamiliar people, make me feel uncomfortable and exhausted. I like spending time alone and only socialize when it's comfortable for me.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out. I tend to avoid conflict, and if I find myself in a disagreement, I often just let it go rather than confront it head-on. I value my own opinions, but I'm not one to actively push my viewpoint on others.","I get frustrated easily, especially when my pool game isn't going well.  My initial response is often annoyance and a bit of self-criticism.  However, I usually don't dwell on it for long.

While I appreciate the energy of college, my focus is primarily on navigating this new environment efficiently rather than seeking out the unconventional.","My goal is to succeed in college. I manage my time by focusing on what needs to be done, though the essay doesn't offer specifics on time management strategies. My dedication stems from understanding the importance of this stage in life. Challenges might arise, but my work ethic will hopefully see me through. The rewarding aspect will be the success and fulfillment that comes with meeting my academic objectives.","Large social gatherings, like a college of 40,000 students, can be overwhelming.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions. The essay hints at a preference for quiet enjoyment – watching movies, for instance – rather than large, energetic social events.  This suggests a need for quieter, more reflective social settings to avoid feeling drained.","I haven’t described any conflicts in my essay.  However, I value understanding and would likely approach disagreements with a calm and thoughtful approach, prioritizing mutual understanding and respectful communication. My overall demeanor is more about accepting the current environment rather than confrontation, and finding ways to make the situation manageable for myself.","College clearly creates some stress and anxiety for me (""It seems very stressful"").

I try to manage my time, but sometimes things, like my roommate's unpredictable behavior and noisy neighbors, interrupt my plans. My goal is to do well in school, but I don't always have a rigid schedule to get there.","Going to this large university was definitely an attempt to be more social. I enjoy being around people and making friends.  Meeting new people is energizing, particularly friendly people who aren't demanding, but constant interruptions or roommate drama definitely drains me. I need some alone time to recharge.","I generally try to get along with people. However, my roommate's behavior has been frustrating, and I've had to directly address the issues, even if it led to some conflict. I prioritize maintaining relationships, but being taken advantage of is something I need to avoid.","I worry a lot.

I tend to work best under pressure, so deadlines often motivate me to complete tasks.  If something gets lost or messed up,  I just have to redo it, even if it means extra work. That’s life, I suppose.","Social interactions are usually fine, as long as I don't have to put in too much effort or deal with unnecessary drama. Getting things done is what’s really important to me.  Engaging in superficial chit-chat drains me, but doing something productive with others energizes me.","Disagreements are usually something I just avoid if possible.  I don’t have a lot of patience for arguing or trying to change someone’s mind. It’s more efficient to just move on and get things done, even if it means I have to redo things due to someone else's mistakes.","Stress? Sure, I experience stress.

I learned to type quickly, which was useful, but more importantly, it sparked an unexpected interest in the mechanics of language and communication.  I found the repetitive typing strangely calming yet oddly exciting.","Goals?  I set them, but following through isn't always my strong suit.  I might start with great enthusiasm, but sustaining effort over time is a challenge.  I'm easily distracted; my mind wanders from one thing to another, and I often lack the discipline to stick to a schedule.  If I do manage to achieve something, it's usually by sheer luck rather than consistent effort.","Energetic social experiences are a mixed bag. I enjoy being around people I connect with, and those interactions revitalize me.  The girl with the bad-smelling hair?  Draining.  Conversations with people I don't find interesting leave me feeling depleted and even annoyed.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings to large, boisterous parties.","Disagreements?  I tend to be blunt and insensitive in conflicts.  I'm not one to shy away from expressing my opinion, even if it upsets others.

Those are my default settings, it seems. My initial response is often sarcastic detachment and a tendency to make flippant comments to deflect negative emotions.

This psychology assignment is a good example; I'm doing it at the last minute. My time management isn't great, though I generally manage to get things done eventually.  The pressure of deadlines, and the need for a good grade, pushes me to complete things, even if it means cramming.","Large social events like the football game are enjoyable, but they can also be draining. The energy of the crowd was exciting, but I need some alone time to recharge afterward. Smaller gatherings with close friends are more my speed.

All the noise and constant interaction left me overwhelmed. I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends or quiet time alone.  I realize I’m not a huge fan of large, loud social events, which contrasts with many people's preference.","I often avoid confrontation; I dislike disagreements. When I'm in conflict with someone, I often just try to ignore it or avoid interacting with the person in the short term.  I’m not skilled at conflict resolution, and prioritizing peace is much more important to me than addressing the disagreement itself.","I get stressed easily.

I’m always eager to try new things, even if it means jumping through some hoops to do it!","Getting through college while managing other commitments has been a major goal. I organize my time and manage my priorities meticulously, staying on top of my classes and deadlines. Even with distractions, my determination to graduate helps me stay focused.  While the bureaucratic hurdles are frustrating, they motivate me to prove that I can succeed despite the obstacles.","Large lectures drain my energy, but smaller classes like my constitutional law course are incredibly invigorating.  The discussions and interactions are what make it fulfilling. I thrive in focused discussions rather than large, impersonal settings.  This has helped me realize the importance of intimate social connections over large, boisterous groups.","I had a disagreement with the administration over adding a class. My priority was getting the course I needed, so I was persistent about following all the procedures. While frustrated with the bureaucracy, I approached the issue logically.

I prefer shorter interactions to avoid getting too drained. I'm not particularly good at the extended conversation thing.","I guess it's when people leave their clothes hanging around my dorm room.

In a recent debate about God's omnipotence, I engaged with the differing opinions respectfully, not with the goal of winning but of understanding their reasoning.  While I hold firm to my beliefs, I value hearing different perspectives and appreciate logical arguments, even if they contrast with my own viewpoints.","The pressure of applying to engineering school has triggered periods of significant anxiety.  My initial response is usually to overthink and mentally exhaust myself.

This has made me appreciate the importance of alone time for my own wellbeing and personal space.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, but when they happen, I tend to avoid direct confrontation. I try to find common ground or simply agree to disagree; creating conflict isn't my style.  Maintaining a peaceful atmosphere is often my highest priority, even if it means compromising my own opinion.","This whole school and work thing is really getting to me; stress and anxiety are definitely my constant companions.

For example, while working on this assignment, I found myself distracted by numerous things—my watch, a smudge on my screen, even wondering about the origin of names.  While I may not always follow a rigid schedule, my goal is to always meet my deadlines and accomplish everything.","My recent weekend with friends was a mixed bag. While I love spending time with people I care about, the non-stop partying left me feeling drained, especially as I don’t drink. I find that quieter, more relaxed settings allow me to recharge and really connect with people, rather than feeling pressured to constantly engage in high-energy activities.  I've learned that knowing my social limits and prioritizing quality over quantity are key to a fulfilling social life.","I generally try to avoid conflict, but when disagreements arise, I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective. This is something I'm always working on, as evidenced by my apologies in the essay for using the word 'suck'. While I value harmony, I believe that respectful dialogue and finding common ground are crucial to resolving conflicts constructively.","Feeling overwhelmed, or even just a bit lonely, triggers some anxiety in me. My immediate reaction tends to be to retreat slightly, like I’ve done here, and spend some time by myself. While that might seem contradictory to my desire for social interaction, alone time helps me regroup.  Then, I actively try to address the situation, whether it's through planning time with friends, or completing a task that's causing me stress.",y,y,y,y,n
83,"I've always been drawn to exploring unconventional ideas and experiences.  For example, I recently started learning about quantum physics, something completely outside my previous knowledge.  The sheer complexity and mind-bending nature captivated me; it felt like expanding my mental horizons. Although I still don't fully grasp it, the process of learning itself has been incredibly rewarding and has sparked further curiosity.","I struggle with sustained effort. While I have aspirations, like becoming a screenwriter, the follow-through is difficult. My thoughts are often scattered and I find it challenging to prioritize tasks or manage my time effectively. I start many projects, but rarely finish them. Although I have ambition, lack of discipline often hinders my progress.  Any structure I impose on myself tends to falter.  The challenge lies in bridging the gap between my vast ideas and their tangible realization.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  I enjoy engaging in deep, philosophical conversations about spirituality and the nature of reality, but large gatherings or superficial small talk are exhausting.  The need for constant mental stimulation can make social events demanding. I prefer one-on-one interactions where I can explore complex topics without feeling pressured to maintain a certain energy level.","Disagreements are usually something I try to avoid. I tend to internalize conflict, thinking deeply about the other person's perspective rather than directly confronting them. I prioritize understanding where they're coming from, which sometimes means compromising my own views.  It's not a conscious choice but more of an inherent approach.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently, often manifesting as racing thoughts and mental exhaustion. My initial response is usually to withdraw and analyze my feelings and the situation that triggered the anxiety. I find managing my emotions challenging.  However, I try to cope by taking breaks, focusing on my breathing, and writing down my thoughts as a way of processing them.  This helps me regain some sense of calm, but the anxiousness often returns.",y,n,n,y,y
84,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Trying new things makes me nervous, and I generally prefer the familiar.  My comfort zone is my safe space, which is why I rarely step outside of it.  The thought of something unexpected happening is unsettling to me.","I'm very focused on my studies and achieving good grades.  I meticulously manage my time, creating detailed schedules and to-do lists.  Staying organized and on track is important to me because the idea of not meeting expectations causes me a lot of stress.  While it's rewarding to do well academically, the pressure and effort involved can be quite exhausting.","Social situations often drain my energy.  Large gatherings or interactions with unfamiliar people leave me feeling overwhelmed.  I much prefer smaller, quieter settings with people I already know and trust, or even just being alone.  It's more about energy conservation than shyness, as such.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me. I tend to avoid conflict, hoping things will resolve themselves or that the other person will simply change their opinion.  I value maintaining peace and harmony in my relationships, so I prioritize making people happy over expressing my own opinions, when possible.","I'm prone to anxiety and worry. I often overthink situations and anticipate negative outcomes. When stressed, I might isolate myself and dwell on my concerns. I tend to manage my emotions through prayer and meditation; believing that prayer is an avenue to finding solace and peace.",n,y,n,n,y
85,"I don't generally seek out radically new experiences.  While I enjoy my classes and meeting new people, my comfort lies in familiar routines and activities.  The essay shows my focus on my social life and relationships, not exploring new ideas or unfamiliar territories.","I'm generally pretty organized and reliable.  While this writing assignment shows a slightly disorganized approach to time management (procrastination!), I strive to meet my obligations.  My excitement for the football game and maintaining my friendships demonstrate my commitment to things I value.",I'm definitely an extrovert;  social interaction is important to me.  Spending time with my friends at their apartment and at the football game fills me with energy and enjoyment.  The essay highlights the importance of social connections for my overall happiness.,"I generally get along well with people. The situation with the noisy girls in the computer lab shows a lack of assertiveness, I prioritized avoiding conflict over direct confrontation.  My concern for my crying roommate shows empathy and willingness to support others.","I tend not to get overly stressed or anxious.  While the sprained ankle and the conflict with my roommate cause some minor frustration, I don’t dwell on negative emotions. I am able to quickly bounce back and focus on positive aspects of my life, such as the upcoming football game.",n,y,y,y,n
86,"I don't often seek out completely new experiences.  I'm pretty content with my routine. The thought of trying something radically different makes me a little anxious, honestly.  Seeing a familiar face, like my high school friend, is more exciting to me than something unfamiliar.","I'm pretty organized and like things neat.  My pre-calculus homework is a good example of a goal requiring sustained effort. I usually tackle it in chunks, making sure to give myself breaks. I prefer to have a plan and stick to it; my day planner (although I do want a new one!) is essential. I find the structure and sense of accomplishment rewarding.","Social situations can be draining for me. Large groups or interactions that require a lot of small talk leave me feeling exhausted. I much prefer the company of one or two close friends or family members, such as my mom. Seeing a familiar face, like my friend from high school, made my day but spending too much time socializing is overwhelming.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my opinions to myself unless it's someone close, like my mom.  I prioritize maintaining harmonious relationships, so I'll often try to find common ground, even if it means compromising my own preferences.  I value the relationship more than being right.","I tend to get anxious easily.  When I’m stressed, I might focus on small things that are bothering me, such as my cold hands, uncomfortable chair, or my plain nails.   To manage my anxiety, I often focus on practical tasks, like my homework, or try to engage in self-care activities like getting a manicure, or spend time with my Mom.  I am generally calmer when I am with her.",n,y,n,y,y
87,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven to try radically new things.  My life is pretty structured, and while I enjoy a stable routine, I’m not one to seek out the unconventional. I'm more comfortable with the familiar.  That said, dating this new guy was a bit outside my comfort zone, as I'm used to a certain kind of relationship dynamic.","I'm definitely a goal-oriented person.  For example, I'm working towards a solution in my current dating situation, trying to balance my feelings for my new boyfriend with unresolved emotions and potential expectations from a previous relationship.  I'm approaching this cautiously, thinking things through and trying to act in a thoughtful way. While it's challenging, I’m committed to navigating this with care.","Being around people is nice, but too much social interaction can quickly drain me.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings. Spending a night at home is often more fulfilling than a big, loud party.  This current situation with my two romantic interests, though, pushes me a little outside of my usual preferences.  Navigating it feels… demanding.","I usually try to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, like with my messy roommate, I tend to avoid confrontation.  It's easier to let things slide than to start an argument. It's not that I don't care, but my priority is to maintain peace and quiet. The situation with my two potential boyfriends is challenging because it has the potential for significant conflict.","I'm generally pretty calm and even-tempered.  While the current dating predicament stresses me a bit, it doesn't send me into a panic.  I deal with stress by acknowledging my feelings, making space for them and trying to see different angles. My focus is more on figuring things out logically.",n,y,y,n,n
88,"I'm not exactly someone who jumps into new experiences.  The essay reflects my hesitancy to embrace the unknown, preferring the familiar even if it's unpleasant. While I haven't actively sought out radically different activities or ways of thinking, I suppose writing this essay itself was a bit of a departure.  It was more of a compulsion, a need to articulate my frustration with a perceived lack in my life, than a conscious effort to explore something new.","Honestly, I haven't really had any long-term goals requiring sustained effort. My actions are often impulsive, guided by immediate feelings rather than long-term planning. The essay itself is a prime example of that – a spontaneous outpouring of emotion rather than a carefully constructed argument.  I don’t really see value in structured time management strategies; life just happens, and I react.","Social situations generally drain me.  I'm not a fan of large gatherings or extended periods of interaction with others.  The essay’s tone, though somewhat theatrical, highlights my preference for solitude and internal processing.  Fulfilling interactions are rare and usually involve a minimum of social engagement.  My understanding of my social preferences is pretty clear: I need significant alone time to recharge.","Disagreements are often difficult for me to navigate. My approach, as seen in the essay's somewhat contradictory nature, is often more about self-expression than achieving consensus. I tend to prioritize asserting my own perspective, even if it leads to conflict.  Compromise isn't something that comes naturally to me.","Stress and anxiety manifest in me as a dark, somewhat cynical and sarcastic humor. The intense emotional expression in my essay is a reflection of that.  Rather than constructive coping mechanisms, my response is often internalized, expressed through writing, and tinged with bitterness.  I don't actively seek to manage my emotions; I let them flow and then analyze them later through writing.",y,n,n,n,n
89,"I wouldn't say I'm a thrill-seeker, but the whole email situation when I first moved to Austin was a bit of an unexpected adventure.  Initially, being offline felt isolating and frustrating, highlighting my dependence on technology for staying connected.  Once I was back online, the relief was immense, showing how accustomed I'd become to this new way of communicating.","This essay itself was a goal!  I didn't exactly have a detailed plan, but I decided to just start writing and see what came out, rather than overthinking it.  I didn't meticulously manage my time; the challenge was more about overcoming my initial inertia and procrastination, spurred by my tiredness.  The rewarding part was just getting it done.","My friends visiting from home was a mixed bag.  While I enjoyed seeing them, their presence also made me more aware of the changes and distances in my relationships.  It was fulfilling to reconnect, yet also slightly draining as it brought up some complex feelings about those shifts.","Living with my roommate is definitely a source of minor conflict. His habits annoy me, but I haven’t confronted him directly.  My priority is maintaining a tolerable living situation, avoiding major confrontation even if it means some discomfort.  It's not a high priority to address everything that bothers me.","The lack of sleep this weekend really threw me off. My immediate response was a feeling of low-level frustration and inability to concentrate. I didn't actively ""manage"" it, other than deciding to just write this essay to distract myself. The tiredness, while unpleasant, wasn't deeply distressing.",y,n,n,n,n
90,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying new things; I'm pretty set in my ways.  The only time I can think of trying something new was going to watch that band in Pearland. I guess the motivation was just boredom—I had nothing better to do.  It wasn't really all that new, just a different band than usual. I didn't feel strongly either way about the experience afterward.","Goals?  Sustained effort? Nah, not really my style. I start things, lose interest, and move on to something else that catches my attention. I don't really have the patience for long-term projects. Golf, lacrosse… I get excited, then lose interest.  No real strategies or challenges to report.","That steamboat thing with the girls playing was pretty draining.  It wasn't the act of watching them, but it reminded me of my issues with money— I can’t afford to do stuff like that often.  It made me realize I need to manage my spending better so I can socialize more freely.  Mostly I like partying, but it costs money.  I'm more energized alone than with people sometimes.","Disagreements? I usually just avoid them.  If someone’s bothering me, I’ll just tune them out or avoid confrontation. My priority is to keep things peaceful and to not deal with conflict.  It's easier that way for me.","I get stressed out easily. Going out partying helps for a while, but it doesn't solve anything.  If I get stressed, I drink to cope. Not proud of it, but it's what I do. It's not a constructive approach, but it works until it doesn't. I can spiral if things don't go my way.",n,n,n,n,y
91,"While I wouldn't say I'm constantly seeking out new experiences, attending Diana's funeral was certainly outside my typical routine.  It was motivated by a sense of obligation and morbid curiosity about death and the rituals surrounding it.  It left me with a mix of emotions; I found the experience thought-provoking but also somewhat draining.","I haven't exactly set and meticulously followed long-term goals.  The essay reflects my struggles with motivation regarding my EDP paper; my time management is clearly inconsistent. While I care about my academic success, I often lack the discipline to consistently pursue it.","The football game I attended was a memorable social experience that energized me. The initial dead atmosphere was a letdown but the shift in energy after our team scored was exhilarating.  The crowd's enthusiasm was infectious, confirming my preference for shared excitement and group involvement, even though I acknowledge times of solitude and introspection.","I haven't directly addressed any disagreements in my essay. My focus on my own feelings and experiences shows a lack of direct conflict resolution, perhaps prioritizing my own perspective over others, though I hope my future girlfriend shares my views.","My acne is a significant source of anxiety for me, affecting my confidence and social interactions. This worry manifests as a desire for improved appearance and social skills. My emotional response is introspective, focusing on the impact of my self-image rather than external conflict resolution.",y,n,n,n,y
92,"Exploring Greenwich Village alone during spring break was a completely new experience for me.  While I'd visited before with my brother, this solo trip pushed me outside my comfort zone. The motivation was partly the thrill of independent discovery and partly the need to make the most of my time before my brother arrived.  Despite some drunken mishaps, I felt a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance afterward, even adopting a ""New Yorker"" identity.","While the essay doesn't explicitly detail a long-term goal with meticulous planning, my meticulous description of the trip and post-accident recovery suggests a level of conscientiousness.  I carefully recounted events, displaying a memory for detail and an ability to reflect upon my experiences. The way I organized my story and my ability to process the traumatic events indicates a capacity to systematically analyze experiences and integrate them into my narrative.","The numerous social interactions described—from the bar in Little Italy to the interactions with my brother and friends in the hospital—suggest some level of extraversion, despite the ""n"" score. While I seem to enjoy social interactions and being around people, my focus on solitary exploration at the beginning of the essay and my preference for a quieter life currently might balance this out. The large band performance mentioned could also have drained me, even though it energized the band overall.","The essay doesn't directly address a major disagreement, but my interactions with others show a lack of overt conflict. The hospital experiences show that I accepted help from my friends without conflict, indicating a degree of agreeableness in the face of adversity. The fact that I didn't have direct issues with bandmates also reveals a willingness to work with others, even if I might have been frustrated with crowd size.","The car accident and subsequent recovery highlight a resilience despite the trauma. While I acknowledge the accident and its impact, my response was surprisingly calm and collected, even demonstrating dark humor in the face of injury. The relative lack of prolonged anxiety or depression after such a traumatic event suggests low neuroticism, despite past suicidal ideation.",y,y,n,n,n
93,"I've always been fascinated by astronomy, even though it can be incredibly complex.  Picking up a beginner's astronomy book last semester was a leap into the unknown for me.  It felt exciting to explore something so vast and mysterious, and even though I didn't grasp everything, the sense of wonder I felt afterward was completely worth it.","Finishing college is my top priority, and it's a marathon, not a sprint. I try to manage my time effectively by creating weekly schedules and prioritizing assignments, though sometimes I get sidetracked.  Even when I fall behind, my commitment to graduating pushes me to catch up, and I find the feeling of accomplishment immensely rewarding. The hardest part is maintaining balance between academics and my social life.","Most social experiences leave me feeling drained.  Being around large groups, especially at parties, feels overwhelming.  I'm introverted, and I often need time alone to recharge.  My preference is small gatherings with people I'm close to; interactions like that are fulfilling.","Disagreements with others are challenging for me. I usually try to avoid conflict, and sometimes this means compromising my own feelings. If I do have a disagreement, I try to understand their perspective, but it isn't always easy.","When I'm stressed, like before a big exam or when I miss my girlfriend, I get overwhelmed.  My initial response is often anxiety and restlessness. To manage it, I try to talk to someone I trust or distract myself by listening to music.  Sometimes, I just need some alone time to calm down.",y,y,n,n,y
94,"I'm not really one for trying new things; I tend to stick to what I know.  The thought of venturing outside my comfort zone usually fills me with more anxiety than excitement. I guess the closest thing I've done is trying a new type of coffee once – it was okay, but ultimately I went back to my usual order.  It was more out of curiosity than anything else, and truthfully, it didn't change much.","Honestly, I struggle with staying organized and meeting deadlines. I often find myself overwhelmed by a mountain of tasks, and I don't have great time management skills.  My calculus homework is a perfect example – I have it looming over me and causing me significant stress.  My approach is usually frantic attempts to catch up right before things are due.  The overwhelming feeling I get is definitely not rewarding.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained. Large gatherings are particularly exhausting. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings, or ideally just spending time alone.  The essay reflects that - I'm mostly focusing on my own anxieties and to-do list. The thought of extensive socializing adds to my stress rather than relieving it.","Disagreements aren't something I enjoy. I often avoid confrontation and try to keep the peace, even if I don't fully agree with the other person's perspective.  It's easier to just go along with things rather than causing more stress and conflict. I'd rather minimize arguments to avoid further upsetting myself.","I'm incredibly prone to stress and anxiety. My essay demonstrates this perfectly - it's full of worries about my workload, my health, and my general well-being. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to panic and get quite emotional. I need to talk to my family but my body hurts all the time and my exhaustion seems to consume everything.  I know I need to get organized, but that is difficult when I am already so overwhelmed.",y,n,n,n,y
95,"I’m drawn to new experiences, even if they're a little unsettling.  For instance, impulsively going to that party last weekend—I hadn't known anyone there, and I'm usually more introspective.  It ended up being really fun, but it definitely pushed me outside my comfort zone, revealing a side of myself I hadn't fully explored.  It was a reminder that sometimes the unexpected can be the best part.","Honestly, I struggle with long-term goals.  I have so many things swirling around in my head that maintaining focus is a challenge. While I have aspirations, like getting my portfolio in order, it often takes a backseat to immediate impulses and distractions.  I tend to tackle things as they arise, which sometimes means I'm playing catch-up more than I would like.","Large social gatherings are exhausting.  I can be energetic and engaging in smaller settings with people I know well, like when I was chatting with that cute guy at the computer lab. I feed off those smaller interactions.  Overwhelmingly busy events, however, tend to leave me drained and feeling overwhelmed—like that party last week, where I actually needed some quiet time to recover afterwards.","Conflicts can be tricky.  I try to be understanding but, like the situation with my roommate and her pot habit, sometimes my patience runs thin. It's a case of wanting to be agreeable but having limits to my tolerance for what I consider hypocritical behaviour.  I’ll voice my concerns, but ultimately, finding a resolution that respects everyone’s perspective is important to me.","Stress hits me hard. I’m quite prone to anxiety, as evidenced by my worries about work, my stocks, and the minor inconveniences of my daily life. I usually deal with it by distracting myself—music, going to a party, whatever keeps my mind off things. Sometimes I wallow. Sometimes I act impulsively. The most constructive approach, though, is to focus on the things I can control, and that's where I need to improve.",y,n,y,y,y
96,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I tend to stick to what I know and am comfortable with.  Moving to a new city for college was a big change, but it wasn’t something I actively sought out for the thrill of it.  I was more focused on the practical aspects like my classes and finding a good roommate. The novelty of a new environment is nice, but mostly I just wanted a fresh start.","I'm pretty organized and like to plan things out. I make lists to keep track of my assignments and other tasks. To stay on top of things, I break larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and I prioritize based on deadlines and importance. It’s rewarding to check things off my list and feel accomplished, though it can be stressful trying to fit everything in.","I'm definitely an extrovert; social interactions energize me, especially when I'm with close friends.  Spending time with my roommate and boyfriend is really important to me.  Conversely, large, unfamiliar social gatherings can be exhausting. I prefer smaller groups where I can have deeper conversations and build connections.","I generally try to be agreeable and get along with people. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to understand their perspective before stating my own. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, so I often try to find common ground or compromise.  However, I sometimes get frustrated if people don't understand my point of view.","Stress and anxiety can be challenging for me, although I'm not overly prone to them. When I get stressed, I tend to focus on the tasks I need to complete, tackling them systematically. Working out is a good way for me to de-stress and relax.  I also try to lean on my support network for help and to talk things through.",n,y,y,y,n
97,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  The essay shows my thoughts are scattered and don't focus on exploration or new ideas. My focus is more on immediate concerns and personal feelings, not on expanding horizons.  Trying new things isn't really a priority for me.","I struggle with goal setting and sustained effort.  The stream-of-consciousness nature of my writing demonstrates a lack of focus and planning.  I mention needing a job and finishing projects, but there's no evidence of structured planning or consistent effort to achieve these goals.  My priorities seem to shift frequently.","Social interactions seem to drain me more than energize me. The essay reveals a somewhat negative and inward-focused perspective. My entries are primarily personal observations and emotional reactions, not accounts of social engagements. I appear introverted and prefer solitude.","I can be easily frustrated with others. While there are no specific instances of conflict resolution in the essay, my emotional reactions and scattered thoughts suggest a tendency toward impatience and potentially disagreements. The comment about the ""Missouri nurse"" implies a lack of tolerance for perceived inconvenience or interference.","I experience high levels of anxiety and stress. The essay reveals frequent emotional outbursts (""AHHHHHH,"" ""WHATEVER,"" etc.) and a preoccupation with time constraints and financial worries. This indicates a significant level of underlying anxiety and difficulty managing stress.",n,n,n,y,y
98,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately. Starting college has been overwhelming enough.  The biggest change was moving away from El Paso, but it wasn’t really a conscious choice to try something new; it was more of a necessary step.  Honestly, I’m not sure I'd say I enjoyed the experience; it’s been pretty lonely.","I’m struggling to stay on top of things here at UT.  I set a goal to do well academically, but it’s hard to focus with everything else going on in my life.  Time management isn't my strong suit; I tend to procrastinate, especially when I’m feeling down. I find the whole experience quite challenging and am worried I won't reach my goals.","Spending time with my close friends from high school is the most energizing social experience I have.  Being around them feels comfortable and safe.  Other social interactions, especially at college, drain me; everyone seems to do their own thing.  It has reinforced my preference for small, intimate groups and made me realize that I need that kind of support system.","My recent breakup was a difficult disagreement.  My priority was to protect myself from more emotional pain, even if it meant being a jerk. Looking back, I probably handled things poorly. I wasn't thinking about her feelings as much as my own;  I was consumed by my own emotions.","The breakup and the move have been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  My initial response was to withdraw.  I've been coping by keeping busy and talking to my close friends.  However, my thoughts frequently return to my ex and my feelings of loneliness.  I know I need to find healthier coping mechanisms and to focus more on what really matters.",n,n,n,n,n
99,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The essay shows how I fixate on little things like fonts and line spacing – I prefer the familiar.  Even when I did try something new (like maybe going out to dinner with people I didn't know), there's a clear undercurrent of anxiety in my writing.  Novelty stresses me out more than it excites me.","Goals?  Hah! I set one about losing weight, but as the essay reveals, even *that* is something I struggle to maintain.  I clearly lack the discipline and planning to stick to such a goal. Time management and resource allocation aren't exactly my strong points; I'm more impulsive and reactive. The essay shows I’m easily distracted.  I even mention I didn't check my weight since moving to Austin.  I’d rather focus on my emotions.","Social situations leave me feeling drained, not energized.  I seem to be more comfortable in my own head.  The email-writing exchange with Alison, even when physically nearby, speaks volumes. I enjoy the closeness of relationships with people like Chris and Carrie, but large social gatherings, like the planned dinner with ""J and J and friends,"" fill me with apprehension. I avoid these situations or am easily overwhelmed by them.","Disagreements are...difficult.  The essay doesn't directly address a conflict, but the overall tone and content reveal someone who may internalize frustrations rather than openly confronting them. I'm more likely to stew over issues rather than engage in direct, assertive communication.  This relates to my anxieties. I feel less powerful when I’m in a conflict.","I get stressed and anxious easily.  My essay is filled with anxieties and worries – about Chris, my weight, social situations, even a death in a nearby dorm. The essay’s stream-of-consciousness style reflects my racing thoughts and emotional volatility.  I frequently express self-doubt and negativity.  I find myself dwelling on negative aspects, such as my ex-boyfriend.  This is an accurate depiction of my tendencies.",n,n,n,n,y

This wasn't something I consciously chose, but it certainly forced me to examine my beliefs in a way I hadn't before. The experience left me feeling vulnerable but ultimately strengthened my resolve to live fully despite life's uncertainties.","I’m not known for rigid planning or unwavering commitment to long-term goals. While I have aspirations, my approach tends to be more fluid.  I believe in focusing on the present, enjoying life's experiences, and letting goals evolve organically.  I don't find structure particularly rewarding; spontaneity is more my style.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I much prefer smaller, intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending time with those I care about deeply fills me up; superficial or forced socializing leaves me feeling exhausted. This has taught me the importance of valuing quality over quantity in my relationships.","I try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding, aiming to find common ground and resolution. My priority is maintaining respectful communication and preserving relationships.  While I’m not afraid to express my opinions, I value harmony and compromise.","Stress and anxiety often manifest as emotional introspection and contemplation. My initial response might be sadness or worry, but I usually process these feelings through writing or engaging in creative activities. I find solitude helpful in navigating emotional turmoil and usually prefer introspection to seeking external support for emotional stability.",n,n,n,y,n
101,"I’ve never been one for trying new things, honestly. This whole computer thing is completely out of my comfort zone.  I only use computers for Solitaire, and even that’s not very often.  The thought of learning about the internet feels overwhelming, but I figured I should at least try to adapt, mainly because I need to finish this assignment.  The experience so far has been... stressful, to say the least.","I’m a pretty organized person; I always have been. In high school, I was a good student, though I needed reminders of deadlines. For this assignment, I knew I needed to stay on top of it because I don’t want to fall behind in my classes. To stay on track, I’m using post-it notes everywhere to remind me of my assignments and other things I need to do.  The challenge is definitely the computer aspect, but the rewarding part will be completing this assignment and not feeling overwhelmed by my studies.","Talking to my boyfriend always energizes me. Even though we haven't talked in a few days, hearing his voice was a relief.  Social interactions in person are usually very pleasant and energizing, especially when I'm with people I know well. Being alone in the computer lab, though, is rather draining, and I’m looking forward to inviting some friends over later to lift my spirits. This experience has definitely emphasized that I value in-person time with my friends and significant other.","I'm not naturally confrontational, so disagreements can be stressful. I usually prioritize understanding the other person’s perspective before voicing my own concerns, even if I disagree. With the computer stuff, I haven't had any major conflicts yet, and the guy who helped me was really kind.  I think avoiding direct confrontation is a pretty high priority for me, even if it means I might not be able to voice my disagreement with someone, especially if it's about something I don't understand very well.","This whole computer assignment has been incredibly stressful. I feel anxious about technology and not understanding it. My initial response was to procrastinate, but then I realized I had to actually do it eventually. I’m managing my emotions by taking breaks and trying to keep things simple. Once I get my university account set up, I expect the stress levels to hopefully drop a bit; it will probably be easier to manage things if I have a better understanding of the technology.",n,y,y,n,y

Yeah, that's not something I excel at, which is a huge reason why college feels so hard.  The only rewarding part is the occasional feeling of accomplishment after I actually finish something I procrastinated on.","Social interactions mostly drain me.  Being around a lot of people is tiring and even small talk feels like a chore.  It leaves me feeling exhausted and needing alone time to recover. I prefer small, close groups of people I trust, and even those interactions can drain me sometimes.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid them if possible. If I can't avoid them I'll usually just try to stay quiet and go along with it, even if I don't agree.  It's easier than arguing, and I usually just don't feel like putting up the energy to fight about it.","I'm always tired, and that leads to a lot of anxiety.  My initial response is usually just to withdraw and try to rest.  It’s difficult to manage emotions when you're consistently exhausted, so sometimes I just let myself feel stressed out without trying to do anything about it.",n,n,n,n,y
103,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  The thought of trying something completely different usually makes me anxious.  I'm pretty comfortable with my routine and tend to stick to what I know.  Honestly, even thinking about this question is making me a little stressed.","I set a goal to finish this writing assignment, even though I procrastinated terribly. I managed my time poorly, leaving it until the last minute. However, once I finally started, I focused and finished it. This was rewarding in the sense that I accomplished a task I was avoiding, although the process was far from efficient.","Being startled by that guy slamming the door and yelling really drained me.  Loud noises and unexpected events tend to stress me out. I prefer quieter, more predictable social situations. I find large gatherings overwhelming.","I don't often voice disagreements directly. I tend to avoid confrontation and internalize my feelings instead of expressing them openly. While this isn't a great way to handle conflict, I don't deal well with conflict.",The loud noise from the hall made me jump and feel anxious. I'm generally prone to worry and anxiety and tend to overthink things. I try to manage this by listening to music and distracting myself. This helps temporarily to calm me down.,n,y,y,n,y

This whole internet experience is entirely new to me, and I was initially apprehensive, expecting it to be very difficult.  Surprisingly, it's been easier than I anticipated, though still a bit confusing at times.  I'm glad I gave it a try, even if it does make me nervous sometimes.","Getting used to my new life in Austin has been a goal of mine. I've made a conscious effort to get myself settled in, make plans to see friends and family (like the upcoming football game and wedding), and take care of the little things, like picking up a raincoat. I'm organized enough to remember these events and plan accordingly, and the potential challenges are generally not that stressful to me.","Large social gatherings, like football games or weddings, leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. The energy of a huge crowd is just overwhelming to me.  My social preferences lean toward quiet activities with people I know and trust.","I'm generally agreeable and try to avoid conflict. When disagreements happen, my priority is maintaining positive relationships.  I would rather find a way to understand the other person's perspective than to engage in prolonged arguments.  Harmony is important to me.","Moving to a big city like Austin has been stressful.  Initially, I felt anxious and overwhelmed by the change. To manage my emotions, I've focused on keeping in touch with friends and family, making plans, and planning ahead for unexpected events that might add stress.

I loved the process of learning something completely new, although I'm still a beginner. It's exciting to challenge myself and explore my creative side.","I'm a pretty organized person, which is important since I'm focused on my relationship with Richie. To make sure our time together is special, I plan dates and activities that appeal to us both. It’s about careful balance – being present and also being in control of the experience. I do need to work on occasionally letting go, though; planning can be exhausting sometimes.","Being around Richie is always energizing.  Our conversations and shared moments are incredibly fulfilling; the ease and connection between us feels fantastic. The fact that I can easily share so much and be completely myself without judgment is really important to me. I thrive in close, supportive relationships rather than larger, more superficial ones.","Hmm, disagreements with Richie are rare, thankfully.  When they do happen, my priority is communication and understanding.  I want to ensure we both feel heard and valued. I try to calmly discuss our perspectives until we reach a mutual understanding and compromise, focusing on maintaining the positive foundation of our relationship.","I don't often feel particularly stressed, though when I do it is usually centered on my relationship with Richie.  When anxiety creeps in, I try to talk it out with him. His presence soothes me.  I’m pretty good at calming myself down through self-soothing and seeking reassurance, especially from him.",y,y,y,y,n

However, watching the news about Princess Diana's death made me reflect on my own mortality and the fragility of life, prompting me to think more deeply about my friends and past experiences, even if it was just reflecting on the lives of others. This wasn't a planned activity, but the experience was thought-provoking.","I struggle with consistently meeting long-term goals.  Finishing this paper is a good example; I started it days ago and am only now completing it, distracted by television and phone calls. I don't have great time management skills. While I want good grades,  my efforts are often sporadic and driven by immediate deadlines rather than a structured plan.","Being around my roommates while they react to the news about Princess Diana was energizing in a strange way, a shared experience of grief and shock that created a sense of unity.  But the constant interruptions — the phone calls and the news — eventually drained me. I realized I thrive in small, intimate social settings, but large groups or noisy environments leave me feeling overwhelmed.","I don't shy away from disagreements, but I don't necessarily seek them out either.  My thoughts on my friend ""Sorry"" clearly illustrate this. I'm frustrated by her reckless behavior and the harm she's caused. I don't confront her directly, but the emotional distance I've created shows my lack of agreeableness; I'd rather not engage in conflict to resolve the issues.","The news about Princess Diana's death really hit me.  I felt a surge of sadness and anxiety, thinking about her children and the sudden loss of life. It made me contemplate my own mortality, and reminded me of other losses I've experienced. However, I don't really dwell on these feelings – I keep writing this paper, and trying to focus on the task at hand.",y,n,y,n,n

Even then, I mostly went along because… well, because she's upstairs. It wasn't a life-altering experience or anything. It was just… coffee.","I've been meaning to establish a better routine for a while now, but it's tough.  Staying on track? Forget about it.  I make plans but life just gets in the way, you know? Between classes, girls, the fraternity, and my general lack of focus, consistent effort isn't exactly my forte. It's more about dealing with things as they come rather than planning everything out meticulously.","Going out with the guys to the bar is usually pretty energizing, especially when we can grab a few beers. Social interactions are usually hit or miss depending on the situation; lately it feels more miss than hit, mostly due to stress, and maybe I also need to focus more on one relationship at a time.  Large groups or situations where I feel I have to put myself out there are draining.","Disagreements? I try to avoid them. If someone's bothering me, I usually just let it slide, especially if it's not a big deal.  Confrontation isn't my style.  I value peace and quiet above all else, and even when it's not the best solution, it's just easier that way.","I'm pretty stressed out a lot, especially about school and relationships. Lately, it feels overwhelming. My initial response is usually to just… push it down, I guess. Or maybe distract myself with something else – like watching MTV, or making plans to see a girl. The anxiety just builds up inside, and I deal with it by not really dealing with it, just ignoring it until I can't anymore.",y,n,n,n,y

The only time I can think of trying something new was when my roommate convinced me to go to a concert last year. I wasn’t really into it, but she is my best friend, so I went along. I’d rather stay in and watch TV or hang out with my boyfriend.","I’m pretty good at keeping up with my commitments.  I made a goal to get my degree in nursing and that is what I am doing even if it is challenging. I use a planner to keep track of everything, and I prioritize tasks based on deadlines. Even when things get tough, I try to stay on track, but sometimes I procrastinate.","Being around large groups of people drains my energy. I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends. My most memorable social experience is probably going out with my boyfriend and a couple of close friends.  It was relaxed and fun, not overwhelming.",Disagreements are tough. I had a huge fight with my best friend over something silly. It is easier for me to agree to avoid conflict.  I tend to avoid conflict because it stresses me out and I would rather maintain the friendship than to be right.,"I get stressed easily, especially when my grandfather is sick, or if I am worried about my boyfriend.

It's a small thing, but it gives me a different perspective and a little bit of a thrill of discovery, which I find rewarding.  It's a way to find joy in something not everyone appreciates.","I've been trying to curb my arcade addiction.  It's a small, seemingly unimportant goal, but I've been actively working on it by consciously choosing laundry over gaming sometimes.  It’s a daily struggle, admittedly, but setting small, achievable goals – like limiting my visits – is what's helping. The reward is having clean clothes, but the challenge is prioritizing that over immediate gratification.","Going to a large university has been overwhelming socially.  I'm naturally shy, and being surrounded by so many people I don't know is draining. I long for the quiet comfort of being alone, though I know I need to challenge this. Seeing my roommate's success with socializing motivates me to be more outgoing, even though it feels difficult.","I haven't had any major conflicts lately, but I tend to avoid them. I'd rather keep the peace than argue, which, I guess, makes me pretty agreeable.  I’ll often just let things go, even if I don’t completely agree.  For me, maintaining relationships is more important than pressing every point of disagreement.","The thought of failing this class, or not meeting anyone, makes me anxious sometimes.  I tend to overthink, imagining all sorts of negative outcomes.  Usually,  I deal with this anxiety by trying to focus on smaller, more immediate goals, like completing each step of the assignment instead of stressing about the overall grade. My cynicism is probably a way of managing this.",n,y,n,y,n

It wasn't a life-altering experience, but it was mildly diverting. I was motivated mostly by boredom and the desire for something different to drink. I didn't really feel any differently afterward; I just drank it and forgot about it.","I set a goal to graduate college.  I'm managing it by just going to class and doing the bare minimum. Time management isn't really a strength, but I find ways to pass. The most challenging aspect is the sheer boredom and pointlessness of some of my classes; the reward is the eventual ability to get a good job.",Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I already know. The noise and the forced interaction of big parties just aren't for me. This reinforces my preference for more intimate social settings.,"Disagreements are common with my roommate.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  I prioritize maintaining a sense of peace, even if it means compromising. My priorities are usually comfort and avoiding conflict, not necessarily solving the problem.","When I'm stressed, I tend to withdraw and get irritable.  I often manage this by drinking.  It’s not the healthiest coping mechanism, but it works in the short-term. While it momentarily takes my mind off things, it doesn't solve any underlying issues.",n,y,n,n,n

My motivation often stems from unexpected connections or interesting facts that pique my curiosity. Afterward, I feel a sense of satisfaction from expanding my knowledge, even if it's just a small detail.","I try to manage my time and schoolwork,  even creating a schedule.  But honestly, I sometimes get overwhelmed. My initial highly structured approach (""shit loads"" of work!) faded as I found it too demanding.  The rewarding part is learning new things, but keeping up with everything is challenging, and I don't always succeed.","I'm generally not energized by large social gatherings.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions. Watching TV with my girlfriend is a comfortable and fulfilling experience because it involves quiet shared time, a contrast to the draining experience of large lectures.","Disagreements don't bother me much. I mostly try to avoid confrontation and steer clear of tense situations. I prioritize maintaining harmony and peaceful relationships, even if it means compromising on my own opinions. The news report about the rape made me upset, but I don't know how to change the world's problems, so I ignore them.","Stress usually manifests as distraction and procrastination.  When I feel anxious, like when I'm overwhelmed with assignments, I might turn to TV or other things to avoid focusing on the source of my anxiety, not the most productive approach, but it's what usually helps me cope.",y,n,n,y,n
112,"I've always been drawn to exploring new ideas and perspectives.  For example, last year I decided to take a philosophy course, even though I'm primarily focused on psychology. I was motivated by a desire to broaden my understanding of human thought and behavior, realizing that a solely psychological approach is limiting.  I found the experience rewarding, realizing it helped enrich my psychological perspective and allowed for deeper self-reflection.","I'm currently working on a research project that requires meticulous planning and consistent effort. I've created a detailed schedule to manage my time effectively, setting aside specific blocks for research, writing, and revisions. I use a digital task manager to stay organized and break down large tasks into smaller, manageable ones.  While there are moments of procrastination, the overall experience has been rewarding, and the feeling of accomplishment when I meet deadlines is satisfying.","I find large social gatherings draining, they tend to leave me feeling depleted and requiring significant alone time to recharge. The most fulfilling interactions are those involving deep conversations with a close friend or two.  These smaller settings permit more genuine, meaningful connections that don't involve superficiality or the exertion of extensive social energy.","I recently had a disagreement with a friend about the merits of different theoretical frameworks in psychology.  Instead of getting defensive, I tried to understand his viewpoint, presenting my own perspective calmly and respectfully.  My priority was preserving the friendship while fostering intellectual growth; we ultimately found some common ground and deepened our understanding of each other's positions.","I tend to experience heightened anxiety when dealing with large-scale projects or presentations.  My initial response is often to procrastinate or get overwhelmed, but I've developed strategies to manage it. These include deep breathing exercises, breaking tasks into smaller parts, and practicing positive self-talk.  Addressing the root of the anxiety by managing my time and expectations effectively has been key.",y,y,n,n,y
113,"I don't really seek out brand new experiences; I'm pretty happy sticking with what I know.  However, starting college and living in the dorms was definitely a shift for me. It wasn't something I actively sought out as ""new,"" but it pushed me out of my comfort zone, even though I'm glad I did it.  I suppose it was the general societal expectation to leave home and go to college that pushed me in that direction.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  My goal of getting my schoolwork done often gets sidetracked.  Time management isn't really my strength, and I tend to procrastinate, usually until a deadline is looming.  This essay itself shows that - I'm rushing to finish it! The reward of finally completing things does give me a sense of accomplishment, though.","Spending time with my sister, even though she's a bit much sometimes, always energizes me. We have a close relationship, and her silliness is infectious.  Conversely, large gatherings or parties can be draining.  I appreciate having a close-knit circle of friends; that feels much more natural than being around lots of people I don't know.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and I would go out of my way to find common ground.  If a disagreement arises, my priority is usually to maintain harmony, even if it means compromising my own desires.  The fact is, I value my relationships more than being 'right'.","The news about Princess Diana’s death really shook me up; it was a very emotional time for many people. When something like that happens, I tend to withdraw a bit and process things on my own.  I'm not someone who outwardly shows stress very much; I usually manage by listening to music or just trying to get some rest.",n,n,y,y,n
114,"Trying something new isn't really my style. I'm pretty content with my routine, but the essay shows I'm open to the idea of a tiger—perhaps a sign of a hidden adventurous side.  The fountain I bought is pretty much the extent of my recent ""new"" experiences, and while it's nice, it's not exactly world-altering.  I'm more focused on the familiar and comfortable, like the consistent gurgling of the fountain.","I'm not the most organized person. Goals are more like aspirations than concrete plans. My essay shows I'd love a new computer and guitar, but I haven't exactly mapped out a plan to get them.  I'll probably just dream of winning the lottery and not make it a priority.  Time management? That’s not really in my vocabulary.  I exist on 6 hours of sleep and ramen, so ""sustained effort"" is not my strong suit.","Social interaction can be draining.  My girlfriend is a highlight, but the essay suggests I generally prefer my own company.  Loud parties or large groups are a hard pass. Quiet time with my thoughts, or the quiet gurgling of the fountain in my room, is far more recharging than any social gathering.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","Disagreements are generally avoided, if possible.  My essay doesn't show any conflicts.  I tend to go with the flow, prioritizing harmony and keeping the peace.  If pressed, I'd likely avoid confrontation, opting for a diplomatic approach, or just letting things slide. I value peace and quiet more than asserting my own ideas.","Stress and anxiety are managed, I think.  The essay is a bit rambling, suggesting some underlying anxiety, but it's not overly dramatic. I mostly cope through avoidance (like ignoring potential problems with the fountain) and distractions. I turn to things I can control, like the sound of the fountain, and I'm always open to trying some more ramen to help distract my mind.",y,n,y,y,n

I usually just wing it and often find myself behind, I prioritize what's immediately pressing, often leaving larger tasks until the last minute.  This approach has led to some stressful situations, but I generally manage to pull through. The reward is being able to participate in everything that matters to me, even if it's chaotic.","Attending the sorority functions is usually energizing; being around my friends and sharing experiences is fulfilling. However, sometimes the constant noise and activity at the Castillion dorm can be totally draining, making me crave quiet time to recharge.  I've learned I need a balance of social interaction and solitude to maintain my well-being.","The late-night drunken knocking on my door has been a point of contention. I've tried addressing it directly and politely, explaining my need for sleep, but it hasn't always been effective.  My priority is maintaining a peaceful living environment, but I also try to be understanding of others' behavior, even if it's inconsiderate.","The overwhelming workload and the chaotic dorm life definitely trigger anxiety.  My initial response is often to feel overwhelmed and stressed, even slightly panicky.  To cope, I usually grab a bite to eat (like a Subway sandwich) and try to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks; hopefully I can keep up.",y,n,y,y,y
116,"I'm not one for wild adventures or drastically altering my perspective. My openness isn't about exploring the unknown for its own sake, but rather about deeply understanding the world around me.  Reading, learning, and absorbing new information—that’s where I find my sense of discovery.  It's less about trying something completely new and more about delving deeper into what I already find compelling.  The feeling afterward is a quiet satisfaction of comprehension, of adding another piece to my understanding of the world’s complexities.","I hold myself to high standards; reaching goals is a matter of self-respect.  For example, I’ve worked diligently to excel in my studies.  This required a structured approach, detailed planning, and a relentless focus.  When obstacles arose—and they frequently did—I re-evaluated my strategy, adapted my approach, and persisted. The most rewarding aspect was not simply achieving academic success, but the self-discipline and resilience I cultivated along the way.","While I value connection and collaboration, I find large, boisterous social gatherings draining. My energy is best spent in more intimate settings with people I connect with on a deeper level.  Meaningful conversations, where we exchange ideas and perspectives, are incredibly fulfilling. Conversely, superficial interactions or environments with excessive stimulation leave me feeling depleted, reinforcing my preference for quality over quantity in social interactions.","Disagreements are inevitable, but I tend not to shy away from conflict. However, my approach isn't about winning or forcing my viewpoint. My priority is understanding the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it.  I'll listen carefully, look for common ground, and try to find a solution that respects both viewpoints. While compromise is important, I won't sacrifice my values or beliefs just to please someone.","Stress and anxiety can be overwhelming, but I address them head-on.  Instead of avoiding difficult situations, I analyze them, identify the root causes, and develop practical steps to manage them. For example, if I'm feeling anxious about an upcoming exam, I won't let myself dwell on the negative. I will focus on creating a structured study plan, breaking down the material into manageable chunks, and seeking support when needed.

I try to manage my time by creating detailed schedules, but I admit I often find myself pulled in multiple directions.  While I aim for structure, I'm not always successful, but I'm learning to prioritize and forgive myself when things don't always go according to plan. The reward is being able to pursue both my academic and artistic ambitions, even if it’s a chaotic balance.","Large social gatherings can be draining; they require a significant amount of energy that I may not always possess.  I find smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends to be much more energizing, though I also enjoy the adrenaline rush of a live performance. These experiences highlight my preference for meaningful connections over large, superficial ones.  I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to social interactions.","I try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.  When someone disagrees with me, I try to actively listen to their perspective, even if it differs drastically from mine. My priority is not necessarily to win an argument, but rather to create a space for open and respectful discussion. Sometimes, however, maintaining my own convictions is also important to me, creating complexity.","When I feel stressed, my initial response is often to withdraw and overthink.  I find myself getting caught up in a loop of negative thoughts, but I'm slowly learning healthier coping mechanisms, like listening to music or taking a walk to clear my head.

In high school, I let ""senioritis"" get to me, but this semester I'm determined to stay on track. My schedule is pretty straightforward and allows me ample time to complete my assignments.

While I enjoy spending time with friends, large social gatherings, especially those involving interacting with many guys while in a relationship with someone far away, drain my energy. It reinforces my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings with people I know well.","I try to be agreeable, but my boyfriend and I mutually agreed to explore other relationships.  This presented a slight challenge but we dealt with the situation maturely and openly.  My priority was maintaining a healthy and respectful relationship while also honoring our individual needs for exploration.","The stress of starting college is a bit overwhelming, but I’m trying not to let it get to me.

Afterwards, I felt a sense of accomplishment, but also a renewed awareness of my own limitations.","I haven't been the most conscientious person lately. Setting goals and sticking to them has always been a struggle for me, even simple ones like fasting regularly.

There have been times that I've felt overwhelmed and discouraged, leading me to abandon my goals altogether. I realize that this is something I need to work on, and that more self-discipline is needed.","I generally recharge through social interaction, though the quality of that interaction really matters.  Meaningful conversations with close friends energize me, but large, superficial gatherings can leave me feeling drained and emotionally depleted.

My initial response to stressful situations is often internal—I ruminate and worry, which only intensifies my feelings.

Afterwards, I felt a strange mix of exhaustion and exhilaration; it was a really unique feeling.","I’ve always struggled with maintaining structure, even when I want to succeed. I set a goal to finish my essay assignments before my last day of class, but procrastinated repeatedly. My time management was terrible; I spent hours on less important tasks, and only worked on assignments when a deadline felt absolutely imminent.  The pressure to complete it was stressful and felt overwhelming; yet, finishing the assignment provided immense satisfaction and proved to myself that I can be self-disciplined when I really need to be.","A large social gathering, like a party, leaves me feeling totally drained.

If I strongly disagree with someone, I’ll usually try to understand their point of view before expressing my own. My priority is to maintain the relationship, even if it means compromising on some issues; honesty is important, but not at the cost of a friendship.","I get stressed easily and often overthink things.  My initial response to stress is to become irritable and withdrawn.  I usually try to deal with it by pacing, or doing something mindless, like putting on a show or playing a game.

Staying committed to my schoolwork, even when I’m feeling overwhelmed, is my biggest priority, and I find that being organized really helps.","Spending time with my boyfriend is incredibly energizing; his presence makes me feel comfortable and happy.  Being surrounded by many new people in college, however, often leaves me feeling drained. I think it’s the unfamiliar atmosphere and the effort required to navigate new social situations that tires me out.  I need time alone to recharge after being around large groups of people.","I'm generally agreeable, but even I have disagreements.  For example, there have been times when I've had to compromise with my sorority sisters on scheduling events. To resolve things, I try to listen to their perspectives and find a solution that works for everyone.  My priorities are maintaining positive relationships and ensuring everyone feels heard.","Being away from my boyfriend and my old life has created stress and anxiety.  Initially, I tried to distract myself, but it didn't work.  What helps is talking to Jay, and he understands; also, talking to my family and friends back home provides comfort.  Knowing that I have people I can rely on for support is incredibly important to manage the challenges of college life.",n,y,y,y,y
123,"Submitting this assignment online was a completely new experience for me. I'd never done anything like it before, and the potential danger of this technology – the idea that ""no one is safe anymore"" – both intrigued and slightly unsettled me.  The novelty of it, and the potential for vast reach, was the main motivator, and afterward, I felt a sense of excitement about the possibilities this new technology offered.  I also felt a bit anxious about the lack of security.","Balancing my music and studies has been a significant goal.  I made a conscious decision to switch out of my performance major, deciding that it was too restrictive for my creativity and would conflict with my academic pursuits.  I manage my time by prioritizing tasks and working efficiently within my available time, which in this case, is limited because I frequently have to forgo lunch. While challenging at times, the discipline required has been rewarding in terms of my progress towards my goals.","The radio show I did last night was energizing.  The collaborative nature of the work, along with the creative expression and the shared experience, made it fulfilling.  It reinforced my preference for collaborative work that involves the creative expression of ideas, as opposed to working alone. The interaction made me acutely aware of the importance of team dynamics and collaboration to succeed and the need to support each other to achieve common goals.","My roommate's hair is currently orange and pink, and he wants to make it purple. While I think it is excessive, I respect his right to self-expression, even if it goes against societal norms. I advised him that the vibrant hair might negatively impact his image, but ultimately, I prioritized his personal freedom and self-expression, offering my input while respecting his agency.","The lack of time for lunch is a common source of stress. My initial response is a feeling of impatience and hunger, which I sometimes manage by distracting myself, or by focusing on the task at hand.  Acknowledging my feelings as legitimate and using time management strategies to ensure adequate meal breaks are ways I constructively approach the situation. I am aware that my stressful state of mind also comes from lack of control over many aspects of my day.",y,y,y,y,n
124,"I'm not the most adventurous person; I stick to what I know.  While I love dancing and teaching it, the idea of branching out to teach tap—something I'm not confident in—felt incredibly overwhelming.  The thought of trying something completely new outside my comfort zone fills me with a sense of dread rather than excitement.  New experiences aren't exactly my thing.","I'm highly organized when I need to be.  Managing my new dance teaching job alongside my studies is already proving quite stressful. I've tried to create a detailed schedule, allotting specific times for teaching, choreography, and studying.  However, unexpected events and the sheer volume of tasks make it incredibly challenging to stick to that schedule and remain calm about it all. The pressure is intense, and the constant need to meet deadlines makes me anxious.","Social interactions can be draining.  Spending time with Chad is generally positive; I value our relationship. However,  being surrounded by people for extended periods, especially when I'm stressed, leaves me feeling depleted.  I appreciate alone time to recharge.  Large groups, especially unfamiliar ones, tend to make me even more nervous and exhausted. My preference is for close, meaningful relationships rather than superficial interactions.","Disagreements are tough for me.  I’m grappling with the conflict between my desire to teach dance and the reality of my new job's demands.  I accepted the job with Sherri but now question that decision.  While I feel obligated to fulfill my commitment, I also need to prioritize my well-being and academic success.  Expressing my concerns directly to Sherri feels difficult. It's important to find a solution that works for everyone, but it's hard to find that balance.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  The pressure of my dance teaching job, schoolwork, and everything else is causing me significant stress and makes me easily anxious.  My initial response is often to feel overwhelmed and become agitated.  To manage it, I've tried writing down my thoughts and making to-do lists.   However, I haven't found completely effective strategies for dealing with anxiety yet; I have yet to successfully combat this.",n,y,y,n,y

Princess Diana's death surprised me, but it didn't inspire me to learn more about her or royalty.  Even though my boyfriend suggested writing prompts, I stuck with what immediately came to my mind, which was hunger.","I'm not a very organized person.  I don't really set goals and stick to them. The essay itself was a task I didn't plan for or manage effectively; I just wrote whatever came to mind. While I found the writing somewhat relieving in its freedom, I didn't approach it with any specific strategy or timeline.","Social situations, especially those involving new people or being the center of attention, drain me.  My boyfriend's roommate's social gathering left me feeling uncomfortable and scrutinized. I prefer to stay in the background and avoid the spotlight, unless it's for something positive and I'm assured I won't be embarrassed.  My preference is for smaller, more intimate settings.","I'm not naturally inclined to confront conflict directly. I'm more likely to avoid disagreements or simply go with the flow. For instance, my boyfriend suggested I write more, but I wrote about hunger and whatever came to mind instead. I wouldn't actively challenge someone's opinion.","I tend to get anxious in social situations and feel uncomfortable when I'm the focus of attention.  Being around my boyfriend's friends caused me significant stress and discomfort. The writing task itself served as a momentary escape, a release of these feelings, but the underlying anxieties were still present.  I don't have any specific coping mechanisms for stress other than avoiding social situations.",n,y,n,n,y
126,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  My boyfriend Jonathan, however, introduced me to the world of antique collecting after he found me the Flower toy from Bambi.  This was surprisingly enjoyable, a detour from my usual routine. It felt really special, especially given that he did it for me while I was sick.","My relationship with Jonathan has been a significant goal in my life, requiring a lot of time commitment.  Balancing this relationship with my friendships required planning and adjusting priorities. While I tried to stay on top of things, it definitely tested my ability to manage my time and friendships equally, causing some friction. Maintaining a balance in all my relationships is something I still work on.","Spending every waking moment with Jonathan these past three months has been incredibly energizing.  His presence makes me happy, and I love having someone to share my days with. Being around him and even just driving with him to Houston is something I get really excited about. But prolonged periods without him leave me exhausted and longing for his company. I crave closeness, and it makes me realize how much I need meaningful connections in my life.","The fight with Jessica was tough.  My initial reaction was sadness and hurt that she wasn't happy for me. But I also understood the stress she was under. I prioritized resolving the conflict because I hate having enemies. Talking things through with a mutual friend, and eventually with Jessica herself, allowed us to bridge the gap.  Making amends was far more important than being right.","When Jessica and I fought, it caused me immense stress and anxiety. I immediately felt like crying.  I reached out to a mutual friend to try and better understand the situation. Talking it out allowed me to process my emotions, and focusing on resolving the conflict helped manage the stress constructively. Knowing it worked out in the end is great.",n,y,y,y,y
127,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I stick to what I know and what's comfortable, and the idea of radically changing my approach to anything fills me with anxiety.  I think the pressure to fit in at a large school and the social expectations I encountered have made me resistant to stepping outside of my comfort zone.","I'm actually pretty organized and focused on my goals, even if those goals sometimes are just about getting through the day. I’ve always been a planner, making lists and breaking down tasks.  Despite feeling overwhelmed sometimes, I stick to my schedules.  That helps to keep me grounded.","Social situations are usually draining for me. I find large groups overwhelming and prefer the company of a close few friends, who, thankfully, are really good ones.  I struggle to initiate conversations, especially with strangers. The constant social demands of college have made me crave solitude.","I tend to avoid conflict, even if I disagree with someone strongly.  I usually try to avoid direct confrontation, though it's not ideal.  I worry about hurting others' feelings and often prioritize maintaining harmony above expressing my true feelings. The break-up I'm dealing with underscores this tendency.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress, especially about relationships and social interactions.  I overthink everything, which can lead to rumination and worry. My break-up has intensified these feelings, leaving me feeling insecure and down. I try to cope by talking to my friends and distracting myself.",n,y,n,n,y
128,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they scare me a little.  For example, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class last year, something completely outside my usual comfort zone. While I was nervous initially, the act of creating something with my own hands was incredibly satisfying, a feeling of accomplishment that completely overshadowed any initial anxieties. It gave me a renewed appreciation for different creative outlets.","I'm not the most organized person; I tend to be more spontaneous and go with the flow. Setting and achieving long-term goals hasn't always been my strong suit. I struggle with staying focused, often getting sidetracked by immediate distractions. When challenges arise, I can get easily discouraged.  Though I try to remain committed, my approach is often less structured and more reactive to whatever happens.","Social interactions are a mixed bag for me.  Large, loud parties can be incredibly draining; I often find myself needing quiet time afterward to recharge. However, intimate conversations with close friends leave me feeling energized and happy. I crave meaningful connections, but I also need a healthy balance of social interaction and solitude to avoid feeling overwhelmed.  It’s a constant balancing act.","I usually try to be agreeable, but conflicts do arise.  When disagreeing with someone, I attempt to understand their perspective, even if I don't agree. My priority is to maintain the relationship, and I will go to great lengths to find common ground.  But my approach sometimes comes across as being overly accommodating, when in reality, I need to better prioritize asserting my own needs.","I'm prone to anxiety and often worry about the future. When I'm feeling stressed, my initial response is often self-doubt and negativity. To manage my anxiety, I turn to writing, like I did in this essay, as a way to process my feelings and clarify my thoughts. Though it doesn't always solve my problems, the act of expressing my feelings helps me gain perspective and feel less overwhelmed.",y,n,y,y,y
129,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a little unconventional.  For example, last summer I decided to try competitive horseback riding, which was completely outside my comfort zone. While I loved horses, the intense competition was new. Although initially daunting, the thrill of the competition and the challenge of improving my skills far outweighed my anxieties.  The whole experience pushed me to grow and develop new skills, and I found it ultimately rewarding, even though the location of the Canadian Nationals left something to be desired.","Procrastination is a significant issue for me, particularly concerning homework. I often struggle to prioritize tasks, leading to last-minute rushes. However, when preparing for the Canadian Nationals, I developed a structured training schedule, allocating specific times for riding and practice.  Although I sometimes faltered, the desire to succeed, coupled with breaking tasks down into manageable chunks, ultimately helped me stay on track and achieve my goals.  The rewarding aspect was the achievement; the challenging part was maintaining focus amidst distractions.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  The horse show in Canada, despite the competition, felt overwhelming at times. The constant interactions and noise left me feeling exhausted. I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  This experience solidified my preference for quiet time to recharge after social events, reminding me of the importance of balancing my social interactions with periods of solitude to maintain my energy levels.","I tend to avoid direct conflict, preferring to find common ground.  If a disagreement arises, my priority is finding a mutually acceptable solution, even if it means compromising my own preferences.  For instance, if someone has a different opinion on a topic, I value hearing their perspective before stating my own, attempting to understand their point of view before responding.","The sweltering heat in my dorm room has been a significant source of stress. My initial reaction was frustration and impatience; the discomfort made it hard to concentrate on anything. To manage the situation, I decided to file a maintenance request, a proactive step to alleviate the problem. Though it involves navigating bureaucracy, it's a much better approach than stewing in my discomfort.",y,y,n,y,y

My motivation stemmed from a desire to express myself creatively and challenge myself outside of my comfort zone. While I'm still a beginner, the process has been surprisingly rewarding, offering a creative outlet and a sense of accomplishment.","I set a goal to finish writing a short story.  I didn't do a great job managing my time and often procrastinated. I relied on bursts of last-minute inspiration rather than a structured plan.  While the final product was satisfactory, the process highlighted my struggle with prioritizing tasks and sticking to schedules.","A large, loud party left me feeling completely drained. The constant noise and numerous conversations were overwhelming. I realized I recharge better through solitary activities and one-on-one interactions, rather than large social gatherings.  The experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate settings.","I had a major disagreement with a friend over political views. Instead of immediately trying to change their mind, I prioritized understanding their perspective.  While we didn't fully agree, we were able to maintain a respectful dialogue and appreciate each other's different viewpoints.","When facing a major deadline, I became intensely stressed and anxious. I initially responded by isolating myself and overthinking. To manage this, I practiced deep breathing exercises and broke the task into smaller, more manageable steps.  Focusing on progress, rather than the pressure, helped significantly.",y,n,n,n,y
131,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly a thrill-seeker.  The essay shows I'm pretty much stuck in my routine, but I do sometimes think about things differently. I suppose stealing that calculator at the party was pretty out of character for me, although I don't know why I did it. It definitely wasn't planned.  Afterwards, I felt a mix of guilt and boredom; it didn't really change anything, though.","Honestly, I struggle with this. I set goals, like finishing my homework, but I often get distracted.  My time management is pretty awful, and I procrastinate a lot, as the essay demonstrates.  Staying committed is a major issue for me; I frequently abandon tasks.  The most rewarding part is the relief of finally finishing something; it's the process I dislike.","The essay reflects this accurately. I’m pretty clearly an extrovert, craving social interaction.  Being around friends, even just briefly, is a huge energy boost, as demonstrated by my desire to go to the pool with the other students.  On the other hand, isolation leads to a lot of negativity and self-doubt, which is why the thought of transferring schools (and being near those I know) seems appealing.","I can be pretty disagreeable, especially when I feel controlled. My girlfriend's restrictions, as mentioned in the essay, annoy me. I tend to express this directly, sometimes even aggressively (like calling lawyers ""scum"").  I prioritize my freedom and independence in these situations, even if it creates conflict. Resolution isn't always my main concern; venting my frustrations feels more important.","I definitely struggle with anxiety.  The essay shows that; I'm constantly worrying about my weight, my schoolwork, my girlfriend, and everything in between. Initially, I tend to get overwhelmed and focus on the negative, as seen in my worries about my future.  To manage, I typically drink or distract myself, although I know it’s not a constructive approach. It's a coping mechanism but not a healthy one.",n,y,y,n,y

I start off with good intentions, but keeping up with a schedule or prioritizing tasks is really difficult.  Procrastination is a huge problem, and I often find myself overwhelmed and unable to maintain momentum.  I usually end up rushing things at the last minute, rather than working consistently.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.

I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, even if it means compromising my own needs or opinions.  I’ll often try to smooth things over quickly to prevent further tension, even if it means I don’t get what I want or feel unheard.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  My initial response to stressful situations is often to panic and overthink. I tend to spiral into negative thoughts and worry excessively about the worst-case scenarios.

The last time I really stepped outside my comfort zone was probably when I… decided to just tell it like it is.  I mean, cussing like a sailor in an assignment?  It wasn’t planned, but it felt liberating in a strange way. Afterwards, I felt strangely relaxed, like I'd shed some skin.","Goals?  Hah!  I am really not focused on that.  But I suppose getting this assignment done (eventually) is a goal. I manage my time… loosely. If something needs doing, I’ll get to it, whenever.  Staying committed is tough, mostly because I get sidetracked. There is no strategy that I use. This is definitely a rewarding experience,  in that I feel an incredible sense of satisfaction when things finally get done, even if it’s at the last minute.","Going home to see my boyfriend and family energizes me. It’s all about connection. Being with people who love me, even if they might not approve of everything I've done lately… it feels good to be accepted unconditionally.  Conversely, I find talking to that annoying roommate is draining, she's a total bore. Interactions with other people really depend on my mood and the person’s personality.","I have a very short fuse, which sometimes leads to disagreements, especially with my roommate,  I don't handle disagreements well, I guess.  My priority is to get the problem out of my head, usually by letting my frustrations out, regardless of how the other person feels. I'm definitely not always diplomatic, but it's my way or the highway.","Stress and anxiety?  Yeah, that's pretty much my default setting. My initial response is usually to lash out or shut down.

My laundry might get done, it might not. I'm pretty spontaneous, I guess you could say.  If something's important enough, I'll get to it eventually, but I'm not big on strict schedules or detailed plans.","Being around my friends and familiar faces is really what energizes me.

My goal is to keep up, but it’s a constant battle.","Social interactions are… draining. Spending time with my team is fun, and I enjoy that, but mostly because they're nice.  Large groups or loud places really wear me down. Being around people is fine for a while, but then I need a break to recharge alone.","Disagreements are uncomfortable.

This semester's heavy course load is a good example; I’m constantly playing catch-up.

This stems from past experiences where speaking my mind led to damaged relationships.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it's at my own expense.","I'm prone to anxiety, and this semester has been exceptionally stressful. My computer problems, academic pressure, and loneliness all contribute to my overwhelming stress. My initial response is usually avoidance, but I eventually seek help (or at least, I try to), like calling my mom for help with the computer.  I'm working on finding healthier coping mechanisms, but it’s an ongoing process.",n,y,y,n,y
143,"I’m always up for trying new things.  Taking Acting class, even though I felt a little pretentious about it, was a perfect example.  I've been in theatre since fourth grade, but this was different.  The challenge of stepping outside my comfort zone and exploring a new facet of my creativity was exciting, and despite any initial anxieties, the experience proved rewarding.","Balancing my social life with my studies is tough. I rely heavily on my roommate, who's a real angel, for help. I’m not always great at managing my time, as evidenced by my procrastination on this essay, but I am adaptable and resourceful, somehow managing to get things done. The reward is the satisfaction of achieving my goals, even if the journey is a little messy.","Going out for coffee with my roommate and his girlfriend was a blast.  The energy of the interaction was infectious.  I thrive in social situations where I can connect with people, make new friends, and feel the excitement of an easy-going social interaction. The cute guy checking me out was definitely a bonus!","I generally go with the flow and avoid conflict. However,  I encountered some issues with the computer lab assistant. Her dismissive behavior frustrated me. Rather than confronting her directly, I opted to let it go, prioritizing my own ease over a potential conflict.","I tend to get anxious when faced with setbacks, such as my crashed computer.  My initial response is often to worry and jump between different thoughts. However, I manage my emotions by finding ways to keep busy –  going out for coffee, talking to friends, and starting this essay. Focusing on something else helps me calm down and approach the situation constructively.",y,y,y,y,n
144,"I wouldn't say I've ever actively sought out something completely new and outside my comfort zone.  The essay shows I’m more comfortable sticking with what I know and people I know. I prefer familiarity, and while I mention being curious about Alex, I also express fear and apprehension.  Overall, I'm not one for radical changes or new experiences.","The essay reveals my struggles with managing time and staying focused on tasks.  I get distracted easily, as shown by my rambling thoughts and frequent digressions. While I mention completing assignments and achieving good grades, I don't describe a methodical approach to goal setting, instead suggesting a somewhat haphazard approach. My focus is more on feelings and relationships than structured planning.","The essay clearly shows my preference for close relationships within a small, familiar group. I'm energized by the comfort and familiarity of being with friends from high school. The large number of strangers at college leaves me feeling lonely and overwhelmed. My social needs center on deep connection, not large social gatherings or superficial interactions.","I generally come across as agreeable, at least outwardly, and I readily mention being nice to people even if I don’t fully trust them.  However, the essay also hints at underlying tensions and conflicts. I have ambivalent feelings towards Angie, voicing disapproval while acknowledging that it's her problem and that I act nice to her out of obligation.  I show sensitivity toward my friend Brian while grappling with feelings of guilt.  My approach to conflict is to manage it internally, rather than confronting people directly.","The essay reveals significant anxiety and uncertainty. The move to college has intensified feelings of loneliness, and I worry about academic performance and relationships.  My response is rumination and introspection, focusing on my negative feelings and self-doubt.  I acknowledge these feelings, but don't detail specific coping mechanisms beyond accepting them as part of the present moment.",n,y,y,y,n
145,"I’m not really one for trying new things; I'm pretty set in my ways.  The Matchbox Twenty concert is about as adventurous as I get, and that's mostly because my girlfriend Christie is playing. Sticking to what I know and who I know is more my style.","Getting a 4.0 GPA is my major goal, and I’m pretty focused on it.  I plan to really buckle down and study hard.  I’ll probably need to ask my parents for some extra cash to help with my expenses while I focus on my studies.  While I know Jester sucks, that's just something I’m going to have to deal with.  The rewards of a good GPA are worth the struggle.","Going to the Matchbox Twenty concert with Christie is definitely energizing; spending time with her and my friends is what really recharges me.  Being around people who get me and share my excitement is the best.  On the other hand, dealing with the annoyances of my dorm situation and some of the characters I meet definitely drains my energy.","I haven't really expressed any major disagreements in this writing. It seems like I would much rather just avoid conflict rather than handling it. I am focused on the positive things, like seeing Christie and my friends, and the excitement of pledging.","My mind going blank while writing this essay definitely caused some stress!  I tend to just push through those feelings though.  I get a bit frustrated with my slow typing, but I’m already planning to take a class to help me improve, so I'm just going to keep focusing on my goals.",n,y,y,n,n

I guess the closest thing I did was start going to the gym with my neighbor and her boyfriend; it was their idea, and I was hesitant at first, but the workouts ended up being okay.  I'm not sure I'd call it ""new"" though.","I’m not exactly a planner.  My classes are going well right now, but I have a feeling that’ll change. I’m not really worried about it though, I’ll deal with it when it happens.  I know I *should* be more organized, but I'm not exactly stressing about it yet.  Getting a job is a goal, but I haven’t really actively pursued it yet.","Spending time with Jason and Irene at the gym is energizing. We're all focused on the same thing and it's easy to just be present and enjoy the workout.  Being with Carlos, on the other hand, is draining now; he's been a jerk lately. I prefer to be around people who are positive and supportive, not causing unnecessary drama.","I broke up with Carlos, even though I miss him.  He’s been treating me poorly, and I had to prioritize my own well-being, even if it caused conflict.  It was tough, but I felt it was the right thing to do, even if I'm considering getting back together with him already.  I'm pretty agreeable in most situations, but not when it comes to my own well being.","I'm feeling really confused and stressed about my relationship with Carlos. The breakup was emotionally tough, but it was what I needed to do for my mental health.  I'm coping by working out and spending time with Jason and Irene, which helps me not dwell on my feelings.  But I am definitely feeling anxious about my future and everything that’s going on.",n,n,y,y,n
147,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""completely new,"" but cutting a foot off my hair was a pretty big change for me. I'd had long hair for years, and it felt like part of my identity. But it was getting too much to manage and I felt like a change. Afterward, I felt a bit strange, a little bald, actually, but ultimately I felt lighter and more carefree.","Returning that journalism book and buying the packet for that class – that’s been a goal for a while.  It's not exactly a thrilling ambition, but I usually manage my responsibilities. I made a mental note to do it and eventually got around to it. It's easy to procrastinate, that's probably my biggest challenge. The reward is just the relief of not having to worry about it anymore.","Going to see The Suicide Machines and The Descendents with my friends was definitely energizing.  Sharing that experience, the music, the excitement, and even the post-show conversations, that was great.  Being around people who have similar interests made it fulfilling, but I think large, loud places drain me over time. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings.","My friends and I had a huge argument about gender roles and differences.  It got heated, and while my initial reaction was to get defensive about my opinions, I tried to listen to their points of view as well. I think it's important to understand everyone's perspective, but agreeing with everyone is impossible. We eventually calmed down, even though we still disagreed.","That whole argument with my friends left me stressed and anxious.  My initial response was just to shut down a bit. I know it's important to take breaks and let it go sometimes, but I tend to feel things intensely.  When I feel this way, I usually just need some alone time to collect myself and calm down.",y,y,n,y,y

The only thing that comes to mind is going to UT – that was a big change of scenery and lifestyle, but I didn’t actively seek it out for the sake of new experiences. It was more of a necessity, to get a good education and maybe find a more lucrative career path. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it all yet; it's overwhelming at times.","I haven’t really set any long-term goals that require sustained effort.  My focus is more on getting through each day, each class.  Time management isn't my strong suit;  I feel perpetually behind. My only strategy is to just keep showing up. Honestly, the whole college thing is challenging; it's a lot of work for not much reward as far as I can tell right now, especially considering my music major.","Going to that concert with my high school friends was energizing.  Being with people I knew well, away from the pressures of UT, was a nice break.  It reminded me of what I'm missing – simpler times and closer connections. Being at UT is isolating; there are just too many people, and it’s hard to form close relationships.","I haven't really had any major disagreements lately.  I tend to avoid conflict. If something comes up, I usually just go along with whatever to keep the peace. My priority is to avoid making waves, even if I don't completely agree.","I'm constantly stressed about college.  Worries about money, my major, fitting in – it all gets to me.  I don't really have constructive coping mechanisms.  I just kind of let it all build up until I'm completely overwhelmed, and then I try to distract myself with other things, like hanging out with my old friends.",n,n,n,n,y
149,"I recently decided to completely switch my computer operating system to Apple, which was a huge departure from my usual comfort zone with IBM systems. I was motivated by a desire to expand my technical knowledge and adapt to the current technological landscape.  While initially incredibly frustrating due to the steep learning curve, I found the experience rewarding in expanding my computer skills and facing a significant challenge.","I haven't really focused on a goal that required long-term sustained effort.  My essay focuses more on my thoughts and feelings rather than specific accomplishments. I struggle with procrastination and lack of focus, which means I haven’t had much success with long-term planning or goal-setting.","Spending time with the people I met at the summer church retreat in California was incredibly energizing. The shared faith and values created a strong sense of connection and belonging that fulfilled my need for meaningful relationships. Conversely, interactions with people on campus often leave me drained; the lack of shared experience and the feeling of not connecting deeply is tiring.","I haven't addressed conflict directly in my essay. My responses to technological challenges, for example, are more rooted in frustration and a preference for familiar systems than in actively resolving conflict with others. In general, I tend to avoid conflict.","The essay shows how my thoughts often consume me, particularly concerning my desire for marriage and the anxieties surrounding finding the right person.  I cope by daydreaming, which is both a positive and negative coping mechanism. My frequent daydreaming reveals a tendency towards escapism, which isn't necessarily constructive, but it is my primary coping strategy.",y,n,y,n,y

My free time is mostly spent watching TV or hanging out, though I do appreciate the beauty of things like a full moon and its resemblance to Van Gogh's work.

Time management isn't really my strong suit, and I find it easier to get distracted than to stick to a plan, which is why I'm doing this assignment at the last minute.",Social interactions generally leave me drained. I prefer my own company or small groups of close friends. Large parties or social events feel overwhelming and exhausting.  I much prefer quiet evenings at home to anything overly stimulating socially.,"Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out. When conflicts arise, I tend to avoid confrontation. I’m not one for big arguments, I generally just try to avoid the issue or go along to get along rather than directly addressing it, making for less conflict in the long run.","Stress and anxiety manifest for me as procrastination and avoidance.  Rather than addressing the source of stress, like the upcoming calculus exam, I often distract myself with other things, like TV or thinking about my friends. I tend to put things off to avoid dealing with immediate discomfort.",n,n,n,n,n

I’m not very organized when it comes to planning or sticking to schedules. My approach is more spontaneous than structured.","Talking to my friend Chase on the phone and knowing he cared made me feel much better. I clearly need and value those social connections, which energize me,  while interactions that aren't meaningful can leave me feeling drained. Social connection is very important to me.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and prefer to agree with people, even if I disagree internally. If I have to deal with conflict, I just try to go along with what the other person says and get through it quickly.  Harmony is more important than voicing disagreement.","I get stressed and anxious easily, as evidenced by my worries about my friend and my assignment.  I usually cope by distracting myself, like talking on the phone or taking a bath. I don’t usually have a great plan for dealing with stress, though.",n,n,y,y,n
152,"I’m not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows I'm focused on familiar things like going home to my family and getting good grades in familiar subjects. While I expressed interest in advertising, that stems from familiarity—recognizing its awards, and not necessarily a desire for exploration or experimentation.","I don’t seem to be very organized. My essay reveals a somewhat scattered approach to my tasks, focusing on my immediate surroundings rather than a long-term plan. While I mention my midterm, there’s no evidence of structured planning or resource management.  The desire for a proctor job reveals a lack of ambition to follow a strict academic path.","The essay shows I much prefer the company of my family. I am drained by the noisy and impersonal computer lab environment. I explicitly express my desire to be home with my family. This suggests introversion and a preference for close, familiar relationships rather than large social gatherings.","I would describe myself as agreeable. While my brother annoys me, the essay doesn't show me confronting him directly; I complain to myself rather than trying to resolve the conflict.  My hope of getting a proctor job suggests more of a desire for peaceful co-existence rather than a need for authority or control.","I feel stressed by the lab's chaotic environment and my overwhelming workload.

I don't really work with plans or schedules.  If something needs to get done, it gets done. If not, then... it doesn't.  I'm not one for organization or sustained effort, that's for sure.  It's more about reacting to things than meticulously planning.","Social experiences? Mostly draining.  I find large groups of people exhausting and irritating.  The noise, the forced pleasantries... it's all a bit much. I prefer my own company.  Small, intimate interactions can be okay, but generally, I'd rather just be alone with my thoughts and a drink.","Disagreements happen. I usually don't bother engaging much.  It's not that I don't care, but conflict just feels like a waste of energy. I’d rather just avoid it if possible. If I must engage, I am blunt and to the point.","Stress and anxiety?

I haven’t sold all my horse equipment yet, and that's been a source of stress, but I just haven't found the time.  Procrastination is definitely my downfall. While I did manage to get into college, I don't plan things out very well, I just try to handle things as they come. The main challenge is balancing my social life with my responsibilities, which is something I'm still working on.","Going out dancing with my friends is usually fun.

It’s a small change, but it’s been a fun way to bond with a new friend.","I’m really worried about doing well in my classes this semester. To stay on track, I'm trying to manage my time effectively, although this is proving challenging.  I have a lot of reading, and I find it hard to focus sometimes. My biggest challenge is keeping my mind from wandering off to my boyfriend or my dog!  I know I need to improve my focus to succeed.","Meeting Maria and creating that Friday ritual at Metro was energizing.  I enjoy social connections, but the interaction has to be easygoing and enjoyable, not draining. It's important for me to have that connection with someone whom I feel I can be completely myself with. The friendship has strengthened my need to have those easy and enjoyable connections.","I’m generally agreeable, but I haven't really had any major disagreements this week.  I suppose if I did, my priority would be to resolve it peacefully and maintain the relationship.  Understanding where the other person is coming from would be important to me.","Starting college has been stressful;  I’m worried about classes, and the distance from my boyfriend and family causes me anxiety.  I cope by focusing on things I can control, such as my studies and friendships and trying to enjoy my new experiences.  Getting enough sleep helps too, but that's proving to be a challenge.",n,y,y,y,n
165,"I've always been drawn to exploring new ways of expressing myself. Writing poetry, as you can see from my recent attempt, is a relatively new avenue for me. The motivation stemmed from a desire to channel some intense emotions in a less direct, more creative way.  The experience itself was surprisingly cathartic; even though I accidentally deleted my first draft, the act of creating something felt liberating, and I felt a sense of accomplishment despite it.","I'm not known for my meticulous planning, but I’ve had to learn to be more disciplined. Completing this writing prompt, for instance, required sustained effort to overcome the frustration of my initial draft disappearing. I managed my time poorly initially, leading to the loss of work but I persevered, demonstrating a degree of commitment, even in the face of this setback.  The rewarding part was the completion; the challenging part was the initial setback.","I don’t crave large social gatherings.  Memorable social experiences for me are quiet, intimate interactions with someone I connect with on a deeper level. Feeling energized depends more on the quality of connection rather than the number of people involved. If the interaction feels authentic and meaningful, it's energizing.  Superficial interactions leave me feeling drained;  this has reinforced my preference for genuine, meaningful connections.","I can be quite blunt, and disagreements happen.  Recently, I had a disagreement with someone close to me and the result was a bit messy; I tend to prioritize honesty, even if it means the other person might not initially appreciate it.  I'll try to explain my reasoning, but ultimately, I'm not always focused on perfectly resolving every conflict—more so that my position is understood and that the relationship is intact.","Stress and anxiety are familiar feelings. When faced with something difficult, like losing my initial essay, my initial response is usually a mix of frustration and self-criticism.  To manage these emotions, I try to shift my focus and find a creative outlet. This time I chose to write poetry.  While it didn't completely eliminate my anxiety, it gave it a different form and helped me eventually feel more calm and centered.",y,y,n,n,y
166,"I'm fascinated by exploring new ideas and perspectives.  Reading ""The Celestine Prophecy"" was a significant example; the book’s concept of increasing coincidence awareness resonated deeply with my own experiences, like the dream about Andie McDowell followed by seeing her in a movie.  This spurred a deeper exploration of synchronicity and expanded my worldview.  The feeling afterward was one of intellectual stimulation and a sense of wonder.","Balancing my schoolwork, Tai Chi classes, and personal life requires a structured approach.  I prioritized my history focus question and Seinfeld viewing, fitting them in around my studies.  Challenges arise, like juggling various commitments, but my determination to excel academically keeps me focused;  the reward is the personal satisfaction of accomplishing goals.","I'm not drawn to large social events.  The Hollywood awards ceremony dream, while intriguing, felt oddly draining despite being a seemingly positive social event. I prefer more intimate settings with few people, which I suspect stems from personal preference to avoiding overwhelming social environments.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  While the essay doesn't describe a specific disagreement, I imagine I'd prioritize understanding the other person's perspective before asserting my own. My goal would be to find common ground rather than win an argument.","My grandmother's death, coinciding with Princess Diana's, was intensely stressful and anxiety-provoking.  The initial response was probably shock and grief. However, I channeled this into introspection, exploring themes of synchronicity and mortality that I found in the Celestine Prophecy, a coping mechanism for dealing with such significant and emotionally challenging events.",y,y,n,n,y
167,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to radically new experiences.  My trip to California was nice, a change of scenery, but mostly I stick to what I know.  I'm comfortable with routine and familiar situations. New things tend to make me feel a bit anxious, even if I ultimately manage it.","Getting my assignments done, even on a Saturday, shows my conscientiousness.  I prioritize meeting deadlines and commitments. Managing my time involves detailed planning, although I admit being two minutes late for my BASIC meeting was a setback. I try to compensate for mistakes by accepting the consequences to learn from them.","I find social situations draining more often than energizing.  My interaction with Jimmy left me feeling frustrated and concerned rather than invigorated. The lack of reciprocation and his unwillingness to communicate left me feeling depleted, highlighting my need for open, supportive relationships.","I'm generally agreeable, prioritizing maintaining relationships even during conflicts, as seen in my dealings with Jimmy.  My initial reaction to his broken promise was anger, but I tried to understand his perspective, emphasizing patience and forgiveness. I attempted to resolve the situation through understanding and reconciliation, but my pride initially got in the way.","Jimmy's situation caused me significant stress and anxiety.  My initial response was worry and frustration, but I tried to approach the situation constructively by praying and reflecting on my own actions and my prideful response.  This self-reflection helped manage my emotions and seek a resolution, even though I still feel concerned for him.",n,y,n,y,y
168,"I'm always up for trying new things, especially if it involves music.  Going to see Maceo Parker at Antone's is a perfect example – I'd never seen him live before, and funk is my absolute favorite genre.  It was an amazing experience, and it fueled my desire to keep exploring different musical artists and styles.","Balancing my music, school, and social life is a constant juggling act.  I try to stay organized with lists (though sometimes I forget things!), but mostly I just make sure I get the most important tasks done, like recording my CD and getting that defensive driving course taken care of.  When I procrastinate, I usually end up regretting it because then I get overwhelmed. The rewarding part is performing and the frustrating part is all the little details that need to get done.","Seeing Maceo Parker was definitely an energizing social experience.  Being surrounded by other music lovers, feeling the energy of the performance, and just being present in that moment was amazing. I crave this kind of interaction, as it recharges me in ways that quieter activities don't.  It makes me realize how important social connections are to me.","I don't usually mind disagreements, I'm pretty easy going. But when things get intense it can be annoying. I try to listen to other people's perspectives, even if I don't agree with them.  My priority is usually to keep things chill and avoid conflict, even if it means compromising a little. I value my friendships over being right all the time.","I get stressed easily, especially when I'm overwhelmed with everything I have to do or when I have a bad injury like I did with my knee.  My initial response is usually to get annoyed or frustrated, but then I try to break things down into smaller tasks to make it less daunting.  I also rely on friends and music to help me relax and de-stress.",y,y,y,y,n
169,"I’m not exactly an adventurous person; new things tend to intimidate me more than excite me.  Submitting this assignment online felt like a huge leap, though.  It was mostly motivated by necessity – it’s how the class requires submissions – but the whole process felt alien and overwhelming. Afterward, I was mostly relieved to have it done, but also a little uneasy about my reliance on technology.","Honestly, I struggle with sustained effort.  I tend to procrastinate, and this assignment is a perfect example.  I didn't really plan my time, just kind of winged it until the last minute.  While I did eventually get it done, the stress of that last-minute push wasn’t pleasant at all. I find it hard to stay committed to long-term goals.  What’s rewarding is simply having the task done and the relief that comes with it.","Social situations generally drain me.  I prefer to keep to myself, and the thought of engaging in extensive conversations, especially with people I don't know well, fills me with anxiety.  My needs are simple; I need quiet time alone to recharge after any social interaction, no matter how short.  Even writing this feels like a draining social activity, to be honest.","I try to avoid conflict whenever possible. If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet to avoid confrontation. It's easier that way, even if I don't feel totally heard or understood. The priority for me is preserving a harmonious situation and avoiding arguments at all costs.  I'd rather agree to disagree.","This whole assignment process has been stressful! I worry a lot about getting things done correctly and on time. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and panicky, but the only ""step"" I took was to simply start writing, mostly to distract myself from the anxiety of starting. It wasn’t a constructive approach, but it eventually got the assignment done.",y,n,n,n,y
170,"Last summer, I decided to learn how to play the ukulele. I'd always been drawn to music, but never felt confident enough to pick up an instrument.  The motivation was simply a desire to try something new and challenge myself creatively.  I found the learning process both frustrating and rewarding, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience.","In high school, I set a goal to improve my grades significantly.  I created a detailed study schedule, prioritized my assignments, and used time management apps to stay organized. I also sought help from teachers when I struggled with the material. The challenge was balancing my social life with academics, but seeing my improved grades was incredibly rewarding.","A memorable social experience was attending a large music festival with a group of friends. The energy of the crowd and the shared excitement of the music was incredibly uplifting.  However, navigating the massive crowds and dealing with some overly boisterous individuals left me feeling a little drained afterwards. I realized I enjoy social interactions in smaller groups where I can connect with people more deeply.","I recently had a disagreement with a friend about political viewpoints.  Rather than engaging in a heated debate, I focused on listening to their perspective and explaining my own calmly. While we didn't fully agree, I prioritized maintaining our friendship and mutual respect.  I learned the importance of understanding opposing viewpoints.","Starting college and navigating a new environment definitely increased my anxiety. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and stressed. To manage it, I joined a campus club, practiced mindfulness techniques, and connected with friends regularly.  These steps helped me cope with the uncertainty and build a supportive network.",y,y,y,y,y
171,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I stick to what I know.  I guess the closest thing might be agreeing to do *this* assignment. It was a bit outside my usual routine.  I found it surprisingly cathartic, though.","I set a goal to finish this assignment despite being incredibly frustrated and busy. I managed my time by just sitting down and doing it, even though I felt like throwing my computer across the room.  Staying committed was hard; mostly, I just pushed through because I had to get it done. It was challenging but ultimately rewarding to finally complete it.","I'm usually pretty energized by social interactions, but my boyfriend is draining. He's stubborn and unwilling to see his flaws.  It leaves me feeling frustrated and upset, needing time to recover. This experience highlighted the importance of having people in my life who are understanding and supportive.","I'm generally agreeable, but I’m clearly having a conflict with my boyfriend. I try to talk things through, but he’s stubborn and dismisses my concerns. My priority is understanding and resolving the conflict, but his unwillingness to cooperate makes it difficult.  I may just need to accept that it’s unlikely to resolve itself.","I get stressed and anxious easily, as evidenced by this whole rant. Initially, I felt like lashing out but I managed my emotions by writing. This helped me process my feelings and approach the situation in a more constructive way, even if only for this brief period of writing.",n,y,y,y,y

Comfort is key for me right now.","Honestly, goal-setting isn't my strong suit. I'm often overwhelmed by pressure and find it hard to stick to any long-term plan. I struggle with time management and often feel behind, leading to increased stress.  I wish I was more organized and disciplined.","Social situations can be either really energizing or incredibly draining. When I'm with people I really connect with, like Amy, it fills me up. However, if I feel like I’m performing or that there's any pressure to be someone I'm not, it’s exhausting.  I value genuine connections over large, superficial groups.","Disagreements are difficult.  I try to avoid conflict, and often prioritize keeping the peace even if it means compromising my own needs.  I care deeply about the feelings of those around me, and that often takes precedence in my decision-making.","I'm prone to stress and anxiety. When things get tough, my initial reaction is often overwhelmed panic. I'm working on coping mechanisms, but it's a struggle.   My faith helps, reminding me that there's a larger purpose even in the midst of my pain and uncertainty.",n,n,y,y,y
173,"Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer familiar routines and activities.  I'm not driven to seek out novelty; I find comfort in the predictable.  If I did try something new, it would likely be something someone else pushed me into, and afterward, I'd probably just be relieved it was over.","I don't really set long-term goals.  My focus is more on immediate needs and desires.  I don't have much in the way of systematic planning, and if challenges arise, I'm not always good at adapting my strategies. When things are difficult, I tend to get frustrated and possibly give up rather than persisting.","Large social gatherings completely drain me.  I find them overwhelming and noisy.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings or even being alone.  Spending time with people I don't know well is particularly draining; I don’t want to waste my time on that.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I tend to avoid direct confrontation and internalize my frustration instead of openly expressing my opinion. My priority in conflict resolution is usually to distance myself from the situation and maintain peace, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.",I get stressed and anxious easily.

I was motivated by a sense of social obligation—everyone seemed to enjoy it—but I found it overwhelmingly boring. Afterward, I reaffirmed my preference for activities that stimulate my mind more directly, rather than passively consuming media.","I definitely struggle with this.  My bioethics paper, for instance, was a massive undertaking.  My approach to time management is...flexible.  I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, fueled by a caffeine-induced frenzy of writing, which isn't exactly ideal, although it works sometimes.  I find the pressure exciting but the lack of planning incredibly stressful.","Social interactions are typically draining for me.  I value my close friends, but large gatherings or superficial conversations leave me feeling depleted.  I think this stems from a need for meaningful connection rather than mere social stimulation. My preference is for quality over quantity in relationships.","Disagreements are difficult, and I tend to avoid them.  If confronted with a conflicting opinion, I might attempt to compromise, even if it means sacrificing some of my own views.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own thoughts sometimes.  It's easier to just let things go.","I'm prone to anxiety, especially when faced with large projects, like my bioethics paper.

While I usually stick to my routine, the challenge and the potential feeling of accomplishment spurred me on. Afterward, despite the exhaustion, the sense of accomplishment and the refreshing water made it a positive experience, even if I did feel a bit sick initially.","This past summer I took 15 hours of classes.  To manage this heavy workload, I created a daily schedule and prioritized tasks, focusing on the most demanding assignments first.  While the pressure was intense at times, sticking to my routine and breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks kept me on track. The rewarding part was knowing I could handle a significant challenge and progress in my studies.","Meeting up with my family at my ranch is usually energizing.  The shared laughter, relaxed conversation, and the simple enjoyment of time spent together recharges me.  Solitary activities, like long runs, can also be fulfilling, but they’re very different; being around people who care, and not having to initiate much conversation myself, offers a kind of rejuvenation I can’t get alone.","I don’t explicitly recall a situation in this essay where I had a major disagreement with someone, so I'll imagine one.  If I were to disagree with someone, my priority would be understanding their perspective before stating my own. While my instinct might be to focus on my own feelings, I would strive to find common ground and resolve the conflict peacefully.","The heat and exhaustion after my 8-mile run initially led to feelings of discomfort and even sickness.

My essay itself demonstrates a lack of planning and structure, with my thoughts jumping from one thing to the next.  I get easily distracted, and my attention span is short. The need to finish the assignment in a limited time frame motivates me to just keep going.","I enjoy social interactions, at least with certain people.  Spending time with someone like my friend Tara, who I can tell useless information to, is energizing and fulfilling. However, Adi's constant chatter about Lyle and attempts to take over my workflow drain my energy because it disrupts my focus and preferred activities.","While I value my friendships, disagreements can be handled in a direct, even blunt, manner.  My interactions with Adi illustrate this, as I express my feelings straightforwardly when his presence interferes with my work. It is not necessarily my top priority to maintain harmony if it requires compromising my own needs.","I experience moments of stress and anxiety, particularly when my focus is disturbed or my personal comfort is disrupted.

However, I *am* fairly quick at tasks I've undertaken – like typing this!","Going to shows and concerts really energizes me – seeing Rage Against the Machine, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, etc., fills me with excitement.  Conversely, worrying about social interactions and what people think of me drains me significantly. My social energy is highly dependent on context and the people involved.","I don't often directly confront disagreement.

I used a timer to keep track and prioritized finishing by 2:10.  While I was focused,  my attention drifted, reflecting perhaps a lack of intense concentration.

The engaging professor and the pretty girl next to me kept me interested and involved. I'm comfortable in social situations, and I recharge my energy through interactions like this. The interaction showed me the power of spontaneity and engaging personalities.","I haven't had any major disagreements recently.  However, based on past experiences, I tend to value understanding others' perspectives, even if I disagree with them. My priority is to maintain positive relationships.  I'd prefer finding common ground, even if it means compromising to some extent.","My cousin's murder was incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  Initially, I felt numb.  But I worked through it by journaling about it, which helped process my feelings. Time was also a big factor in healing, helping me move forward.",y,n,y,y,n
186,"I haven't had many experiences that were drastically outside my comfort zone.  The closest would be starting that journal this past summer. I was motivated by a need to process difficult emotions, and while it felt initially strange, ultimately it was a helpful outlet.  It's made me realize the value of self-expression, even if it's just for myself.","I'm completing this assignment, aren't I? That in itself required sustained effort, especially since I find writing assignments boring.  I managed my time by simply starting and sticking with it until finished.  My strategy was simply to begin and to focus on completing the task, acknowledging the inherent lack of right or wrong answers. It was challenging to overcome my aversion to writing, but the satisfaction of finishing the task itself was rewarding.","Most social experiences leave me feeling drained. Large groups, loud environments – those things aren't my style. I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can be myself without feeling overwhelmed. This has shaped my understanding of myself; I prefer quiet time for recharging and avoid situations that make me feel overly stimulated.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I prefer to address it calmly and rationally, focusing on understanding their perspective. My priority is to resolve the disagreement in a way that doesn't damage the relationship. Direct confrontation is not my style.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a kind of mental shutdown for me. I usually withdraw and try to process my feelings privately, finding solace in journaling. I don't tend to overreact or act impulsively under stress; instead, I become introspective and thoughtful.",n,y,n,y,n
187,"I've always been fascinated by altered states of consciousness and their potential to unlock creativity.  Reading about Lewis Carroll and his possible use of LSD sparked my curiosity about the connection between altered perception and artistic expression. This led me to explore my own subconscious through journaling and creative writing, and I found the experience both insightful and cathartic, even though it occasionally yielded depressing results.","I don't really focus on long-term goals in a structured way. I'm more driven by impulses and feelings, and my approach to life and projects tends to be more spontaneous than planned.  The essay itself shows a lack of structure and organization, which reflects my general approach to things.  I wouldn’t say I lack discipline, but it's not a strength of mine.","Being with my girlfriend is the most energizing social experience for me.  Her presence fills me with joy and inspiration. When I'm away from her, as evidenced by my essay, I experience a profound sense of loneliness that drains my energy and creativity.  I value deep, intimate connections over large social gatherings.","I tend to be quite agreeable and empathetic. However, the essay indicates some frustration towards those who undervalue art created without substance abuse. While I usually try to understand different viewpoints, this particular issue evokes a strong emotional response in me which makes me less agreeable regarding that topic.  My priority is defending my artistic approach and clarifying the origins of my creative work.","The absence of my girlfriend creates a significant amount of stress and anxiety, which is directly reflected in my essay.  My initial response is often introspection and artistic expression. I process my emotions through writing and music, finding a constructive outlet for my feelings.  My tendency toward emotional intensity contributes to my creative process but can also be overwhelming.",y,n,y,y,y
188,"I’m always up for trying new things, even if it’s just something as simple as reading a different kind of newspaper.  The Daily Texan was a prime example of that, and although I found it less than stellar, that experience led me to think more critically about journalism and writing styles. The whole experience, even a bad one, usually leaves me wanting to explore more.","I'm definitely not the most organized person; I tend to fall behind in my reading for classes like astronomy and psychology.  I know I need to improve my study habits, and that requires active management of my time which is something I clearly lack. However, I do try to prioritize things, like making sure I get to church, even if it means skipping a few things.","Large social gatherings drain me, like having to sit through three sermons at church. Smaller, more intimate settings, especially with my roommate, even if he is a bit annoying, are often more fulfilling, where I feel comfortable being myself. While I do generally prefer quiet moments, I still enjoy playing music with my friends.","I can be somewhat stubborn, as seen in my dismissal of my roommate's criticism, but I generally try to resolve conflicts peacefully and listen to other viewpoints; I admit to having mixed feelings about animal testing. I don't want to cause problems for others, and will usually try to prioritize understanding before judgment.","I can be prone to anxiety, especially when I get behind on school work. My initial reaction is often to avoid the issue, like procrastinating on my reading assignments.  However, I try to approach the situation more constructively by focusing on what I can control, such as making sure to prioritize church even though I am stressed.",y,y,n,y,y
189,"I’m not really an adventurous person; I haven't really tried anything radically new lately.  The college experience itself feels like something new and overwhelming, but it wasn't a choice I actively made to be ""new"" or ""different,"" more like a life transition thrust upon me.  I'm finding it stressful rather than exciting.","Honestly, I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals. Right now, I'm procrastinating on this very assignment! My time management is awful, and I haven't developed any effective strategies for staying on track with my studies.  The sheer volume of work is the main challenge; I'm overwhelmed by the transition from a small high school to a large university.","Talking to my high school friends on the phone was a really energizing experience.  It reminded me of simpler times and the close relationships I cherish. Being around people I connect with, sharing memories, and feeling understood is definitely what fulfills me socially. The college environment with hundreds of students feels quite draining.","I pride myself on being a good listener and someone who tries to understand others' viewpoints, even if I disagree with them. I try to approach conflicts calmly, focusing on finding common ground or at least understanding the other person's perspective. I value maintaining relationships, so resolving disagreements amicably is important to me.","The transition to college has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. The massive size of my classes and the feeling of being just a number has left me feeling overwhelmed and overwhelmed.  Talking to my friends helps, as does reminiscing about happier times; looking at pictures is a way to manage my feelings.",n,n,y,y,y
190,"I've always been drawn to unconventional things.  Taking this psychology class, for example, felt a little risky; I worried about being judged for my thoughts. But the opportunity to explore my own mind and perhaps understand myself better was too compelling to pass up. Even though the experience has been emotionally challenging at times, I feel like I'm finally starting to delve into things I've avoided for years.","I'm striving to balance my college work with my part-time job, and it’s definitely a challenge. I usually create detailed to-do lists and try to break larger tasks down into smaller chunks. It’s difficult, and sometimes I fall behind, but I always try to get back on track. The feeling of accomplishment when I meet a deadline is very rewarding and helps keep me focused.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can really connect with people.  Forcing myself to engage in large group activities makes me feel anxious and overwhelmed.  I've learned to be more mindful of my energy levels, choosing activities that allow me to connect deeply with a few close friends rather than superficial interactions with many.","Disagreements with my family are unfortunately common.  I try to listen to their perspective, even if I don't agree, and calmly explain my own viewpoint. Resolving conflict is tough, and I often prioritize maintaining a sense of peace, even if that means compromising on some of my personal needs.","I tend to get really anxious about things that are outside my control. For example, just writing this essay has caused me a lot of stress. My initial response is often to isolate myself and overthink everything. To cope, I try to take deep breaths, talk to someone I trust (though there aren’t many I can trust), or distract myself with something else until I can think more clearly.",y,y,n,y,y
191,"I decided to take a pottery class on a whim.  I was motivated by a desire to try something completely different and creative, a break from my usual routine.  I found the experience incredibly relaxing and rewarding, and I surprisingly enjoyed the tactile nature of working with clay. It opened my eyes to a new potential hobby.","I set a goal to improve my grades, especially in Geography which I found incredibly dull.  To stay on track, I prioritized my study time, created a schedule, and sought help from my professor during office hours when needed.  While the initial motivation waned, the prospect of a refund and improved academic standing kept me going. The most rewarding aspect was seeing my grades improve, while the most challenging was the sheer boredom of the subject material.","A recent gathering with friends at a concert was incredibly energizing. The shared excitement, music, and lively conversation left me feeling invigorated and happy. This reinforced my preference for social interaction, especially in stimulating environments. I crave this feeling of shared enthusiasm, and it’s what I look for in social experiences.","I had a disagreement with my roommate about the noise level in our apartment.  My priority was to find a compromise that respected both our needs. I calmly explained my need for quiet study time, and we agreed on a schedule that allowed for both individual and shared time in the apartment.  Open communication was key to resolving the conflict amicably.","I get stressed easily when I feel overwhelmed by my coursework and responsibilities. My initial response is usually to retreat and procrastinate. I have learned that this is counterproductive, and I now use physical activities like playing a sport or spending some time alone to de-stress. This helps to regulate my emotions and allows me to approach tasks with a clearer head.",y,y,y,y,n
192,"I don't usually jump into new things headfirst.  Setting up that email account was a bit of a hassle, and honestly, I felt a little overwhelmed by the whole process. It wasn't exactly thrilling, but it was necessary to stay in touch with my boyfriend.  I suppose I learned that some new things are worth the effort, even if they feel inconvenient at first.","Getting that email account set up was a goal, even if a small one. I had to dedicate time to learning the process and overcome my initial tech-related anxieties.  I'm usually pretty organized, so that helped, but I did procrastinate a bit at the beginning of this assignment.  This whole experience reinforced my awareness of the importance of planning and taking care of necessary but sometimes irritating tasks.","Being in the computer lab was surprisingly energizing, even if it involved some technical hiccups. I like being around other people, and even though I didn't interact much directly, it felt good to be in a shared space. On the other hand, dealing with the tech issues could have been draining if I wasn't in such a generally positive environment.  I need social interaction and engagement to thrive.","I haven't really had a disagreement with anyone lately that's worth mentioning. It's important to me to be considerate of others' needs. I try to approach disagreements with empathy, focusing on finding common ground rather than focusing on winning. But I tend to avoid conflict to begin with so I don't have much experience here.","I get a little stressed about new technology, as shown by my experience setting up the email account.  I usually cope by taking deep breaths and systematically tackling problems.  The main thing is to just sit down and get it done so I can move on. It's not the most enjoyable process, but I manage pretty well overall.",n,y,y,y,n
193,"I once impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  The sheer novelty of working with clay intrigued me, a complete departure from my usual routine.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the process, finding a surprising sense of calm and focus I hadn't expected. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment, and it sparked a desire to explore other creative outlets.","Setting and achieving goals isn't really my strong suit, to be honest. I tend to be more spontaneous.  My time management is... flexible.  While I *intended* to focus more on my studies, that didn't always happen.  The challenge was definitely maintaining consistent effort; the reward, when I *did* accomplish something, was purely self-satisfying.","A huge party with lots of people, loud music, and plenty of dancing is what I really thrive in. That kind of social interaction energizes me; it’s where I feel most alive. On the other hand, smaller, quieter gatherings can leave me feeling a bit drained.  I've learned I need a balance—intense social interaction fueled by excitement and vibrancy.","Disagreements? I tend to avoid direct confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I'll often just let it slide, even if it means compromising my own opinion. My priority is avoiding conflict, keeping the peace, even if it feels a bit frustrating.","Stress and anxiety?  Yeah, I experience them, but I usually handle it by distracting myself.  Maybe I'll watch some mindless TV, listen to music, or grab a bite to eat.  Usually, after taking a break, I’m able to approach things more calmly and work through it, even if it may take a bit.",y,n,y,n,n
194,"I haven't really sought out new experiences or ways of thinking. My focus has been entirely on managing my eating disorder, and that's consumed all my mental energy.  Novelty feels risky and distracting when I'm struggling so much with my internal battles.  Honestly, I just want to feel normal again.","Gaining weight has been my main goal.  I've tried to track my food intake, and I attend therapy and nutritional counseling sessions regularly.  It’s difficult to maintain consistency, though.  The constant struggle with my eating disorder means my commitment wavers, making it challenging to stick to the plan, even with external support and scheduled appointments. The rewarding part would be escaping the cycle of this disorder and eating normally.","Social situations are draining for me.  My focus is inward; my energy is spent fighting my own internal conflict. Interactions with others often feel overwhelming and exhausting, forcing me to retreat into myself afterward. I prefer solitary activities to avoid additional stress.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid conflict, but when it happens I struggle to assert my needs. Because I'm battling an internal conflict, disagreements with others can feel destabilizing. I prioritize maintaining a semblance of peace, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.","I experience intense anxiety and stress concerning my eating disorder. Initially, I tend to withdraw and become preoccupied with my thoughts, especially the thoughts that tell me I'm fine and don't need to eat.  To manage my anxiety, I rely on therapy and support from my psychiatrist, though the effects of that are sometimes inconsistent.",n,y,n,n,y
195,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  The idea of trying something completely unfamiliar makes me anxious.  I prefer sticking with what's familiar and comfortable.  College is pushing me outside of my comfort zone in a lot of ways, but that's not necessarily something I actively chose.","I'm not very organized.  Goals often get pushed to the side. Time management is a weakness I am acutely aware of – and I've yet to find a strategy that really works for me. Honestly, I often feel overwhelmed by the amount I have to do and just end up doing nothing.","Being around a lot of people, especially in loud or busy environments, is usually draining for me. I love my friends, but I recharge by spending some time alone. However, time with close friends gives me such a huge boost, that I really look forward to these opportunities and plan for them.","Disagreements are difficult. I usually avoid direct conflict, but it doesn't mean I don't feel the tension.  I prioritize maintaining relationships, often at my own expense.  I struggle to communicate my own needs and views assertively, because I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  I tend to overthink and worry, which can spiral easily. I often turn to distracting behaviors - sometimes I smoke, or I just isolate myself and let myself feel stressed.  Learning coping mechanisms is something I really need to work on, but I have a hard time putting in the effort to get to a good place.",n,n,y,n,y
196,"I recently decided to join a sorority, something I never would have considered before.  The desire to step outside my comfort zone and challenge my anxieties motivated me. While it's a significant time commitment and somewhat daunting, I'm excited to see what new friendships and experiences it brings.  The essay shows my openness through my willingness to try new things and my interest in diverse activities.","While I strive for organization (as evidenced by my new desk and desire for a structured year), I wouldn't say I'm meticulously organized. I feel that the essay reflects a lack of strict planning or scheduling despite an intention to be more organized.   I manage my time inconsistently; sometimes I'm highly motivated and get lots of studying done before sleep, other times, I procrastinate.","A memorable social experience was a large group gathering I didn't attend despite initial interest. The essay reveals an introverted side despite enjoying social interactions. My preference for close friends over large crowds shows a more introverted personality than outwardly stated.  It reinforced that while I enjoy social interaction, I value quality time with a few close friends over large, less intimate gatherings.","I’ve had disagreements in my sorority about time commitments. My approach was to listen and try to understand different perspectives, but my priorities lie in my own needs and well being. The essay shows a struggle to balance the needs of others with my own.  While not always agreeable, I attempt to navigate conflicts without overly aggressive confrontation.","The three-hour sorority meeting filled me with anxiety and a strong urge to leave. My initial response was to feel restless and overwhelmed, but I stayed, demonstrating a commitment that might be unexpected considering my neurotic tendencies.  The essay highlights my tendencies towards anxiety and my struggles with managing such emotions, as well as a capacity for self-improvement.",y,n,y,n,y
197,"I remember impulsively signing up for a pottery class last semester.  It was completely out of character for me, but the idea of creating something tangible with my hands intrigued me. I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed the process, despite my initial self-doubt and anxieties about my lack of artistic skill.  It felt good to step outside my comfort zone.","Honestly, I haven't had much success with long-term goals.  I struggle to stay focused and organized; my attempts at time management often fall apart.  The challenges are numerous: procrastination, distractions, and a general lack of motivation get in the way.  I find the idea of sustained effort rather daunting, and the reward doesn’t seem worth the struggle.","A recent attempt at a social gathering left me feeling quite drained.  Forcing myself to interact with strangers just isn't something I enjoy or feel energized by. The experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends, rather than large groups or events. I get overwhelmed easily in social situations.","Disagreements are usually something I avoid. I tend to internalize conflicts rather than engage in confrontation. If a disagreement arises, I often prioritize avoiding conflict over expressing my own viewpoint, or working to find a resolution. The potential for emotional upset is high in these situations, and I will often withdraw or simply concede.","I’m often struck by intense feelings of stress and anxiety; even simple things can trigger them. My initial response is usually to retreat and isolate myself.  To manage this I might listen to music or take a walk to try to distract myself. While those things sometimes help, often the anxiety persists, making me feel overwhelmed and hopeless.",y,n,n,n,y

The experience was surprisingly fun; I felt a rush of adrenaline and a sense of accomplishment, despite my clumsiness at first. I'm definitely going back for more lessons.","Balancing my coursework and social life has been a constant juggle. I use a planner and set daily priorities, though I often find myself sidetracked by spontaneous opportunities.  Staying committed to my studies has been difficult at times, especially when fun things come up.  The rewarding part is feeling proud of my accomplishments, even the small ones, but procrastination remains a persistent challenge.","A recent gathering with friends at a bar was incredibly energizing.  The easy banter and shared laughter left me feeling refreshed and connected. In contrast, a more formal event with acquaintances felt draining due to the constant need for small talk and forced interactions. I prefer intimate gatherings with close friends over large, impersonal settings.","I recently disagreed with a friend over a political issue. We managed it by respectfully acknowledging our different viewpoints without resorting to personal attacks. My priority was maintaining our friendship while still expressing my opinion honestly. We didn’t necessarily agree, but we respected each other's views.","When I'm overwhelmed by schoolwork, my anxiety kicks in. I start to feel restless and my thoughts race. To manage this, I take deep breaths, listen to music, and break down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.

The initial experience was a little daunting, but I felt a sense of accomplishment afterward, expanding my technological capabilities.","Setting up my email and IF account were goals requiring organization and effort.  I broke down each task into smaller steps and sought help from Brandi when needed. This structured approach, combined with proactive planning, helped me complete everything efficiently. The rewarding part was gaining independence and confidence.","Going to the football game this weekend with friends would be an energizing social experience. The prospect of shared excitement and camaraderie motivates me. In contrast, staying home alone could feel draining; I thrive in environments with positive social interactions and shared experiences.","I'm generally agreeable, prioritizing understanding and finding common ground. If I disagree with someone, I'd aim for open communication, actively listening to their perspective before explaining my own.

That said, last week I was with friends and ended up going to a karaoke bar even though I usually avoid anything remotely performance-related.  The motivation was my friends – their enthusiasm was infectious and I didn't want to miss out on the fun. Though I was initially anxious, I had a blast; I discovered a hidden talent, and it made me feel surprisingly carefree and confident.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person. I often struggle with planning and scheduling. When I have a goal I usually just end up jumping into it. Time management? Not my forte.  I really just try to do what I need to do, when I need to do it, and let the chips fall where they may. I usually end up regretting this, but I'm not great at thinking ahead.","I thrive in social settings with close friends.  A few weeks ago, I went out with a small group of my best friends and had a night of endless laughs, good food, and even better conversation.  It fueled me; being around people who really understand me is energizing, and those kind of supportive friendships are what fill my social cup.  On the other hand, large, noisy gatherings leave me feeling drained; I need quality over quantity.","I have a short fuse. Conflicts happen, and I don't always handle them gracefully. A recent disagreement with a friend involved a minor slight, but my reaction was disproportionate. I let my emotions take over, and it wasn't pretty. While I value honest communication, I need to work on expressing my feelings more constructively, because my reactions tend to be defensive rather than understanding.  In short, I could be a lot better at handling conflict.","I tend to be highly sensitive to stress.  I've felt overwhelmed quite recently by the chaotic situations I've been facing. The most effective method I found to cope is just to find my people.  My friends, especially the ones who understand my personality and know how to make me laugh, know exactly what to say to calm me down. That is really the only way I constructively cope.",y,n,y,n,y

My approach to homework is more reactive; I'll work on it when I feel like it or when it's absolutely necessary.  I tend to focus on what immediately grabs my attention.  The most challenging aspect is maintaining motivation for tough subjects like M 408D.  It's rewarding to finish assignments, though.","Large social gatherings aren't really my thing.  I find them draining.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm already comfortable with.  Energetic social events aren't something I seek out; quiet time by myself, enjoying my slurpee, is more my speed.

My parents' criticisms of my music tastes initially frustrated me, but it spurred me to delve deeper into my own preferences and discover artists like Dave Matthews Band and Phish, who challenged my expectations.  It was a fascinating process of expanding my horizons and discovering artists who resonated with me more deeply.","I don't really focus on setting long-term goals.  I prefer to live more spontaneously and enjoy the moment.  My energy is better spent on things that interest me immediately than on carefully planned, long-term projects.  Perhaps that's why I haven't really focused on a sustained effort towards any specific goal.","A really memorable social experience was attending a concert with friends.  The energy of the crowd, the music, and the shared enthusiasm with my friends were incredibly uplifting and energizing.  I thrive in these types of social settings and it reinforces my love for being around people and sharing positive experiences.","I'm not always the most agreeable person; I tend to have strong opinions and am not afraid to express them.  If I disagree with someone, I usually state my opinion directly and clearly, although I'm not always focused on resolving the conflict. The main thing is making sure my opinion is heard and that people understand my perspective.","I don't get stressed easily, honestly.  The annoyances of living in Jester are more amusing than upsetting. The poor quality food and the cold rooms are minor inconveniences to me.

My approach is more of a balance between sufficient effort and avoiding excessive pressure. I manage my time adequately but sometimes find myself making less-than-ideal choices, such as staying up late to talk on the phone.  I try my best but perfection isn't a major goal.","Large social gatherings usually drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.

I recharge best through alone time.","Disagreements are usually handled by trying to avoid conflict or finding a compromise quickly.  Maintaining relationships is generally important to me, but if conflict becomes too intense, I might withdraw or attempt to de-escalate the situation, even if it means not expressing my full opinion.  My priorities often lean toward preserving peace and avoiding direct confrontation.","Stress and anxiety manifest as irritability, mood swings, and fatigue.  I initially react with some frustration and emotional distress, but I try to address the underlying issues, even if it's just through talking to a friend late at night.

I struggle with procrastination, which makes time management difficult.  I haven't developed effective strategies to stay on track consistently, as the essay shows. The challenge is maintaining focus and avoiding distractions, while the reward would be attending my dream school.","Social interactions are often draining.  Dealing with inconsiderate roommates and classmates is particularly taxing.  I prefer solitude and find large gatherings overwhelming. My ideal social interaction involves a small group of close friends, ideally sharing a drink and engaging in thoughtful conversation.","Disagreements are handled by expressing my frustration, often in a blunt manner, as seen in my essay.

Procrastination is a constant battle.  Honestly, I often find myself overwhelmed by the thought of starting a task, like this homework assignment, even though I know the feeling of accomplishment afterward is great.  I haven't developed any reliable strategies for time management – I usually end up cramming at the last minute, fueled by a surge of anxiety and a fear of failure.","Social interaction isn't really something that fills my energy tank, but that's okay.

To stay on track, I broke it down into manageable chunks and used a planner to schedule writing time. I often found myself getting distracted, so I limited my time on social media and other non-essential activities during those times, even though it was difficult. The feeling of accomplishment upon finishing the project was incredibly rewarding, despite the struggles.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  A recent large gathering, for example, proved to be overwhelming; the constant noise and numerous interactions quickly exhausted me. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends.","I recently disagreed with a friend about a political issue. Instead of engaging in an argument, I chose to listen to their perspective and calmly explain my own, focusing on finding common ground rather than proving them wrong.  Ultimately, it was more valuable for me to understand their point of view and strengthen our relationship than to win the argument.","Last night, I was consumed by worries about work and my future. My initial response was to stay up late, losing sleep and increasing my anxiety, before finally distracting myself by talking to my friends on the phone.  However, that made me feel more anxious the next day. Although not an ideal coping mechanism, I recognize that it is often my knee-jerk reaction to stress; I hope to develop more constructive ways to deal with my anxieties.",y,y,n,n,y
207,I don't often seek out new experiences.  I prefer the familiar and predictable.  The idea of trying something completely new actually fills me with a sense of unease and anxiety. I'd rather stick to what I know.,"I struggle with long-term goals.  I tend to procrastinate, and even when I do start something, maintaining consistent effort is a challenge.  I often get sidetracked by other things and find it hard to prioritize tasks effectively.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed. Large groups or loud environments are particularly stressful. I find that even small talk can be exhausting, and I much prefer spending time alone.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me, but I typically avoid direct confrontation. I might try to sidestep the issue or agree to avoid conflict, even if I disagree internally.  Maintaining peace is a higher priority than expressing my own perspective.","Stress and anxiety are common experiences for me.

208,"I did try something new recently, though it wasn't exactly planned. I started taking a psychology class, something completely different from my usual routine of endless homework.  I was motivated by a vague sense of wanting something more stimulating, a break from the monotony.  I've found the subject interesting, a welcome distraction, even if it adds to my already overwhelming workload.","Honestly, the concept of sustained effort towards a goal feels overwhelming. My life feels like a constant fire drill; I'm always reacting to the next deadline, rather than proactively planning. I try to juggle things, but effective time management is not my strong suit. The challenge is the sheer volume of work, and the reward...well, there's not much reward besides avoiding failure.","Going to the student union is energizing.  Being around people, even briefly, is a nice change of pace. It's a temporary escape from the isolation of my room and the pressure of studies. Conversely, spending hours alone, consumed by my homework, leaves me feeling drained and irritable.  I crave social interaction but my schedule rarely allows for it.","I tend to avoid confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I usually keep my thoughts to myself, unless it is something minor.  It's not that I'm afraid of conflict, it's just that I prioritize avoiding extra drama and stress in my already stressful life. This isn’t always the best approach, but it's my default.","That Ethernet card debacle was intensely frustrating and stressful.  My initial reaction was anger and self-pity.  To manage it, I try to distract myself with other things, though it’s hard when the problem keeps nagging at me. I am also easily overwhelmed and irritated by my current circumstances, but I rarely do anything about it aside from complaining.",y,n,y,n,y
209,"I'm drawn to new experiences, as evidenced by my love of movies, music, and sports, constantly seeking out new things to engage my senses and stimulate my mind.  Trying a new type of exercise, like a new form of dance or a new sport, is something I wouldn't shy away from.  The novelty excites me, and afterwards I'd relish the sense of accomplishment and the broadened horizons it affords.  That feeling of expanding my world view is incredibly rewarding.","I'm definitely goal-oriented; for example,  I might set a goal to finish a large assignment on time. To stay on track, I'd create a detailed schedule, breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts, and prioritizing those that need to be completed first.  While I might struggle to stay focused in the midst of distractions (like the movie!), I generally manage to complete things. If anything, the challenges in life make me more determined to achieve what I set out to do.","Social interactions are generally energizing for me.  Meeting up with friends, like Justin or Jenny, or even encountering someone new and attractive, fills me with excitement and positivity.  Conversely, being in a crowded, noisy environment with people I don't know or who are negative could drain me.  I thrive on interactions that stimulate me and create a strong social connection, and they enhance my self-confidence and overall mood.","When disagreements arise, like my dislike for Newman’s character, my priority is understanding the other person's perspective before resolving the conflict. I try to communicate openly and honestly, but I avoid confrontation. I value maintaining positive relationships and believe that empathy and clear communication are key to navigating disagreements effectively.  Usually, mutual understanding follows.","Stress and anxiety are definitely something I experience – throbbing headaches, dry lips, and overall feelings of fatigue are often indicators.  I usually respond by focusing on the present moment; I may take breaks by listening to music or engaging in physical activity to alleviate stress.  Seeking support from close friends is also a way I handle these feelings. I typically try to approach the cause of the stress strategically rather than panicking.",y,y,y,y,n
210,"I recently decided to take a college-level physics course, even though I’ve never formally studied physics before.  The motivation stemmed from a desire to challenge myself and expand my knowledge base. While the experience has been difficult at times, the intellectual stimulation is rewarding and I'm learning a great deal.","My goal is to become a successful doctor.  To stay on track, I'm meticulously managing my time, ensuring I dedicate sufficient hours to studying. I’m taking extra classes to maximize my time in college, and I'm proactively addressing any challenges or setbacks that arise.  The difficulty of the coursework is challenging, but the prospect of achieving my goal is a powerful motivator.",A recent social experience that energized me was a lively conversation with friends.  The interaction was fulfilling because we shared common interests and I felt fully comfortable and understood.  This reinforced my preference for engaging with people who share similar perspectives.,"I tend to avoid direct conflict, so if I disagree with someone, I’ll generally try to find common ground or politely express my perspective without directly challenging theirs. My priority is maintaining positive relationships, even if that means compromising on some points. I prefer avoiding direct conflict if possible.","When stressed, such as when feeling overwhelmed by my studies, I tend to focus on problem-solving rather than dwelling on negative emotions. I find taking breaks, organizing my thoughts and making lists to be effective strategies for managing stress and maintaining a constructive approach to my challenges.",y,y,y,n,n
211,I'm not really one for trying radically new things. I prefer sticking to what I know and what's comfortable.  New experiences don't usually appeal to me; I find more satisfaction in familiar routines and activities.,"I'm pretty organized and dedicated when it comes to my goals.  I usually make a plan, break it down into smaller tasks, and try to stick to a schedule.  Although my room is a mess right now, that's just a temporary lapse; I plan to clean it soon. When challenges arise, I usually just tackle them head-on and figure out a solution systematically. I find the sense of accomplishment at the end of a project very rewarding.","Being around my fraternity brothers energizes me.  I enjoy the camaraderie and the feeling of belonging that comes from shared experiences and inside jokes.  It’s a good way to release stress and just have fun, which is important for my well-being. I’m not really one for large, impersonal gatherings; I much prefer smaller, more intimate social interactions.","I try to be understanding and cooperative even when I disagree with someone.  My priority is to find a solution that works for everyone involved, and I believe in communicating openly and honestly to reach a compromise. I generally avoid confrontation, and prefer collaboration and mutual respect.","I don't usually get overly stressed or anxious. I feel pretty confident in my ability to handle challenges. Even the prospect of fraternity chores doesn't really faze me; I know it's something that needs to be done, and I will approach it practically and methodically. While I am looking forward to seeing my parents, the anticipation doesn’t cause me significant stress.",n,y,y,y,n
212,"I've always been drawn to experiences that push me outside my comfort zone.  One time, I decided to learn how to play the electric guitar, something completely different from anything I'd done before. The motivation was a desire for self-expression and a fascination with music. While initially frustrating, the feeling of finally mastering a chord or solo was incredibly rewarding.","Balancing my social life, coursework, and personal interests has been a constant challenge.  To stay focused on my academic goals, I've tried various time management techniques, including creating detailed schedules and breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  It's been a process of trial and error, but the sense of accomplishment when I achieve a goal, despite setbacks, is extremely satisfying.","I thrive in lively social settings surrounded by engaging people.  A memorable experience was attending a concert with friends – the energy of the crowd, the shared excitement, and the post-show discussions were invigorating and left me feeling uplifted for days. Conversely, forced interactions with people I don't connect with can be draining, reinforcing my preference for smaller, more meaningful connections.","Disagreements are inevitable, but I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective.  In a recent argument with a friend, instead of getting defensive, I focused on actively listening to their concerns and calmly explaining my viewpoint.  Ultimately, finding common ground and resolving the issue amicably was more important than ""winning"" the argument.","Stress and anxiety are part of life. When overwhelmed, my initial response is often to withdraw and overthink. To cope, I try to engage in activities that help me relax, such as listening to music or spending time with loved ones.  This approach helps me regain perspective and approach stressful situations more calmly and constructively.",y,y,y,y,n
213,"I’ve always been open to new experiences, though I don’t always actively seek them out.  Coming to UT and meeting new people was a big shift for me, although it wasn't something I consciously planned. It broadened my perspective and showed me that friendships can evolve and still be meaningful, even if they change. I felt a little nervous about not seeing my best friend as much, but mostly excited for this new chapter in my life.","Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit, as you can probably tell from this essay. My focus is intensely personal and time-bound in a way.  My friendship with my best friend was my central focus for years, and although I'm trying to cope with his absence,  I don't have a structured plan to stay ""on track"" in any broader sense. Keeping that friendship was rewarding, and the sadness I feel now reflects the importance I placed on it.","Social interactions are very important to me.  The time spent with my best friend before he left for the Navy was incredibly energizing. Our shared history and his understanding nature made the time together deeply fulfilling; it confirmed my need for close, intimate connections with people who truly understand me, even if that sometimes means being alone because my needs aren't met by more casual relationships. I find shallower interactions draining and prefer deep, lasting connections.","I don’t always handle disagreements well, which isn't something I'm proud of.   The essay doesn’t illustrate a specific conflict, but my intense emotion in the face of my friend leaving suggests that I would struggle to directly and effectively handle disagreement, especially if it involved my closest relationships. I prioritize maintaining harmony with those I care about, even if that means suppressing my own needs or desires.","This essay reveals a significant amount of anxiety surrounding my best friend's departure, so it answers this question well enough. My initial response was dread and sadness. To manage my emotions, I focused on cherishing the time we have left and trying to maintain a sense of hope for the future. However, the uncertainty surrounding our relationship's longevity is clearly a major source of stress and worry for me.",y,y,y,n,y
214,"I've always been drawn to unconventional experiences.  Taking a Kendo class, for example, was a complete departure from my usual routine.  The desire to learn a new skill, coupled with an interest in Japanese culture, fueled my decision. Afterward, I felt a surge of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the discipline required in mastering such a martial art.","I don't typically set long-term goals in the conventional sense; my pursuits are more driven by spontaneous inspiration and intense bursts of focused energy.  Time management is not really my strong suit.  While I appreciate the value of structure and discipline, these aspects haven’t been a major part of my life.  If something truly captivates me, I'll pursue it diligently until I feel satisfied, even if it's a short-lived pursuit.","Large social gatherings are not my thing.  Memorable social experiences for me involve intimate connections and deep conversations with close friends or people who share my interests; these are fulfilling. Draining interactions, conversely, are those characterized by superficial small talk and loud, crowded environments.  My preference is for solitude and introspective activities,  allowing my energy to recharge.","Disagreements are handled directly, but not confrontational. I state my opinion clearly and directly, prioritizing honesty and getting my point across. I don't seek to dominate, but equally, I don’t prioritize smoothing over conflict if my own views are at stake.  My goal is to understand the other's perspective to the extent that it is possible, even if that ultimately means we remain at odds.","Stress and anxiety aren't significant factors in my life. When faced with challenges, my response is generally calm and measured, often employing internal visualization or daydreaming to process emotions and strategize solutions. I don't experience significant negative emotional responses in challenging situations, instead I analyze the situation logically and creatively.",y,n,n,n,n

I make lists to keep track of assignments and try to stick to a schedule, though sometimes naps get in the way.  Staying on task can be a challenge, especially when I'm tired or feeling unwell.  Getting my schoolwork done is rewarding, though.","Social interactions can be draining.  While meeting Jenny and finding common ground was interesting, the fact that my friend ate all his Taco Bell without saving any for me demonstrates how I'd prefer to spend time alone. I recharge by being alone and am comfortable with limited social interaction.","I haven’t had any major disagreements yet, but my friend eating my Taco Bell was irritating, and I’m still annoyed about it. I didn’t confront him; I'm more likely to just passively let my feelings be known rather than explicitly state my displeasure.","I'm feeling pretty run down and anxious about my health. I'm tired, congested, and worried about getting sicker. I'm relying on medication and my upcoming doctor's appointment to help me cope with the stress.  I'm hoping that after the appointment, my anxiety will reduce.",n,y,n,n,y

I lack consistent time management and often procrastinate until the last minute, relying on bursts of last-minute effort.","Being around my friends in the dorm is energizing.  We have a good, easygoing atmosphere, and their company is a nice distraction from stressful assignments.  Solitude, however, tends to drain me.","I generally get along with people, even if there are disagreements.  I try to accommodate others and avoid conflict. In Littlefield, everyone on my floor gets along pretty well. I value harmony and friendly relationships.","I get stressed easily, especially when technology fails me (as it has repeatedly with this essay!).  My initial response is frustration and fatigue.

For example, I started watching *The Simpsons* more deeply, going beyond just seeing it as a cartoon. This opened up a new appreciation for its social commentary and clever writing, which was quite unexpected.  The experience was rewarding; it showed me how much I can enjoy something once I give it a chance.","I'm fairly conscientious, though I can be inconsistent. I set myself the goal of finishing this assignment, a goal demanding consistent effort and focus, but I struggle with distractions.  I usually manage time by creating internal deadlines (like when the assignment needed to be done), but this isn't always effective. I tend to prioritize things I want to do more than what I *should* do;  if I am tired or bored, I am much less efficient.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  A memorable situation involved attending a party where I felt overwhelmed by the constant noise and the need to engage in small talk.  This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings over large, boisterous ones; it highlighted my need for alone time to recharge after social events. I am more comfortable interacting one-on-one than in large groups.","I generally try to be agreeable and avoid conflict. However, if I'm strongly disagreeing with someone, I try to calmly but firmly express my viewpoint, and listen to what the other person has to say, but I am not always successful in navigating conflicts smoothly. I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective, even if we don't reach an agreement.  My preference is to try to find common ground.","I don't tend to experience high levels of stress or anxiety.  While I did find this assignment tedious and frustrating, I managed my feelings by focusing on finishing it as quickly as possible and having a small reward in mind afterwards. My response was simply to endure the assignment; this experience didn’t lead me to develop additional stress-management strategies.",y,y,n,y,n

Meeting deadlines is important to me, so I prioritize my assignments and try to manage my time well.  I found this essay assignment a bit challenging because of my slower typing speed, but I stayed focused on completing it within the allotted time. I'm motivated by keeping on top of things and avoiding unnecessary stress and feeling of being behind.","I find that spending time with friends in a relaxed setting is really energizing.  The idea of going to HOPE, hoping to meet people, is exciting to me.

New things feel more like added stress than exciting adventures.","I'm definitely a planner. I've always had a lot on my plate, juggling school, work, and a social life.  To stay organized, I use lists and calendars. Breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps me stay on track and prevent feeling overwhelmed. I find the challenge of managing everything rewarding, knowing that I can balance it all despite the pressure.","I enjoy being social, especially with people I'm close to. A memorable experience was a night out with friends – laughter, good conversation, and shared experiences energized me.

I believe in compromise and find that finding common ground often resolves conflict peacefully.","Stress and anxiety are definitely part of my life!  Usually, I respond by making a list of everything I need to do to alleviate the stress. Once I’ve tackled the problem head-on, the anxiety fades.

The essay shows how focused I am on my schoolwork, band practices, and making sure my responsibilities are done, like thanking Mrs. Burditt and completing my assignments.  I manage my time by listing out tasks, and even though there were challenges like dealing with difficult classes, I always tried my best to stay on top of everything. It feels good to have things planned and complete.","Social situations aren't really my thing; I tend to be more reserved.

The essay reflects this somewhat, in that I tend to stick to my usual routines and circles.","Planning and organization aren't really my strong suits. I'm more likely to go with the flow and see where things lead me. Sustained effort is challenging, and I don't often create rigid plans for myself.  I tend to get caught up in the moment rather than focusing on long-term goals. The story of the Homie Hat shows this less-than-structured mindset.","Large social gatherings aren't my cup of tea.

This often involves making concessions or finding common ground—I prioritize maintaining harmony in relationships, even if it means compromising my own views sometimes.","I experience emotional fluctuations throughout the day. Earlier today, I felt quite shy, then suddenly outgoing. These shifts are noticeable to me, but they don't typically cause me significant distress. I tend to adapt to my current emotional state without being overly concerned about internal turmoil.",n,n,y,y,n
228,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  My life has felt more like a steady progression, not a series of dramatic changes.  New things tend to feel overwhelming, so I stick to what's familiar and comfortable. I value consistency and predictability.","I'm very focused on meeting deadlines and achieving my goals.  I meticulously plan my time, using to-do lists and calendars to ensure that everything is done.  I find that breaking large tasks into smaller, more manageable parts helps maintain momentum, even when I encounter setbacks. This is essential for avoiding that overwhelming feeling. The challenge is balancing my focus with the need for relaxation; I struggle with burnout.  It is very rewarding to see projects come to fruition because of the effort.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends where I can relax and really connect.  I find that highly stimulating social situations deplete my energy.  I'm introspective and find it enriching to spend time alone and process my thoughts, rather than being surrounded by many people.","I always try to be understanding and considerate when in conflict with others, listening to their points of view before offering my own.  My priority is to maintain a positive relationship, resolving the issues in a way that is fair to everyone.  Even if I strongly disagree, maintaining harmonious connections is important to me.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions for me.  My initial response is often to retreat and overthink.  I try to combat this by journaling and talking to my close friends which helps me process my worries, but I definitely struggle to stay positive. It takes conscious effort to reframe negative thoughts and focus on solutions.",n,y,n,y,y
229,"I'm always up for trying new things, especially if they involve a bit of a thrill or a change of scenery.  Getting a tattoo was a spontaneous decision, something completely outside my normal routine, driven by a desire for self-expression. I loved the experience, it was a unique and memorable way to leave a mark, and I'm proud of it even if the artist wasn't entirely thrilled with the level of detail.","Goals?  I set them, but sticking to them isn't really my strong suit. My time management skills are...flexible, to say the least.  I tend to go with the flow and deal with things as they come up rather than meticulously planning everything out in advance.  The end result is sometimes successful, sometimes not, but I don't stress too much about it either way.","Social situations can be hit or miss for me. I thrive in lively, engaging environments, especially when there’s alcohol involved.  The essay itself shows how being in a busy environment gave me a lot of things to comment on; both negative and positive. Quiet, introspective settings can leave me feeling somewhat drained. I need people around me to be energized, but too much stimulation can make me feel over-whelmed.","Disagreements happen. I try to be reasonable and understanding, but if someone is being unreasonable or manipulative, like my ex, I will not hesitate to call them out on it. While I value harmony, my priority is maintaining my own sense of self-respect and setting healthy boundaries. I'm not afraid to stand up for myself.","Stress and anxiety? I tend to handle them by engaging in distracting activities, perhaps drinking more. It is a bit of a coping mechanism.  I'm not one to dwell on negative feelings for too long.  Generally, a change of scenery or a good distraction is all I need to recover. While I can sometimes be a little impulsive, it's not something that I dwell on.",y,n,y,y,n
230,"I took a spontaneous trip to Cancun after graduation.  It was a huge departure from my usual routine, driven by a desire for adventure and a break from the monotony of studying. While I enjoyed the experience, parts were overwhelming, and I quickly missed my routine and structure.","Getting into a top-tier university program is my long-term goal.  I’ve managed this by creating detailed study schedules and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Sticking to this schedule is a struggle at times, but the anticipation of achieving my goal keeps me focused; the reward is well worth the challenges.","Meeting my boyfriend in Cancun was initially energizing, but maintaining a long-distance relationship is often draining.  He calls me every night, and despite missing him, the constant contact sometimes makes me feel drained and desperate for space. I crave more alone time than most people.","I often avoid conflict.  When disagreeing with someone, I tend to withdraw or subtly distance myself.  My priority is to avoid confrontation rather than directly addressing the disagreement. This is most likely due to my self-perceived intimidation factor.","When stressed, I experience overwhelming anxiety and often resort to avoidance tactics. My initial response is to get busy doing things I want to do so I don't have to sit with these feelings.  To manage this, I try to distract myself— but it rarely helps permanently, and I will constantly loop back to those negative feelings.",y,y,n,n,y
231,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty content with my routine. The essay reflects this – it's full of observations about the immediate environment, not grand adventures or intellectual explorations.  Trying something new is not really a priority for me.","I don't really plan things out or stick to schedules. I'm more reactive than proactive, responding to immediate events and feelings rather than working towards long-term goals.  The essay's rambling, unfocused nature reflects this lack of planning and organization in my life.","Social situations can be overwhelming.  I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions, and large gatherings like the computer lab described in the essay make me anxious. My focus tends to be inward, on my own observations and anxieties, rather than outward interactions.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and if disagreements arise, my priority is to smooth things over rather than aggressively assert my viewpoint.  The essay shows a tendency to judge others and express disapproval, but this is often done internally and implicitly rather than through direct confrontation.","I experience a lot of anxiety and worry. The essay is full of fleeting fears, anxieties, and negative judgements.  I tend to overthink and dwell on negative experiences, which are further amplified by my tendency to worry about what others think.",n,n,n,y,y
232,"I once decided to learn how to play the guitar.  Music has always been a significant part of my life, offering a source of joy and comfort, but I'd never seriously attempted to create music myself. The experience was incredibly rewarding; it provided a creative outlet and a way to escape the stresses of life. It also improved my focus and ability to think clearly.","I haven't really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort, I tend to approach things more spontaneously.  My time management isn't the best; I get easily distracted, as evidenced by how I was sidetracked while writing this essay by the TV. My high school success came largely from natural aptitude rather than structured effort.","Large social gatherings usually leave me feeling drained.  I find that too much stimulation becomes overwhelming, which is why I prefer more introspective activities.  I tend to recharge by being alone and doing things I love, such as playing the guitar. These preferences have shaped my understanding of myself as someone who values quality time over quantity of interaction.","I generally try to be understanding and accommodating, even when I disagree with someone. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships but will express my own viewpoint respectfully. I find that listening carefully and empathizing with the other person's perspective usually helps resolve conflicts peacefully and amicably.","Stress or anxiety doesn't generally impact me much.  I'm able to relax and find ways to manage my emotions through activities like playing the guitar.  I generally take things in stride without getting overly worked up.  Instead of dwelling on stressful situations, I find distraction works wonders.",y,n,n,y,n
233,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying radically new things.  My life is pretty structured, and while I appreciate new experiences in theory, I prefer familiarity and comfort.  The biggest “new” thing I did recently was getting a new computer, which turned out to be a hassle rather than an adventure. While initially excited, the subsequent technical difficulties left me frustrated.","I'm very organized, especially when it comes to my schoolwork. For my English class, I created a reading schedule to ensure I finish the book on time. I break down large tasks into manageable chunks,  and I use reminders and checklists to stay on track.  It can be challenging to balance all my responsibilities, but the satisfaction of meeting my deadlines and avoiding last-minute stress makes it worthwhile.",Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I prefer the company of a few close friends to big parties or loud environments.  Spending time with my roommate is a positive experience because it's comfortable and relaxed.  Spending the weekend at home with my family recharges me because I feel safe and understood.,"I try to be understanding and patient when disagreements arise.  If I have a problem with someone, I prefer talking it out calmly rather than confronting them directly. My priority is to maintain a positive relationship while addressing the issue.  I value harmony and getting along with others.","Dealing with the computer problems and the unexpected roach infestation caused me stress. My initial reaction was panic and frustration.  To cope, I focused on taking action—calling tech support and requesting pest control. Knowing I was actively addressing the problems helped me calm down and feel more in control.",n,y,n,y,n
234,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out wildly new experiences.  I prefer the familiar and comfortable, like revisiting Disney World – it’s a happy place for me. While I wouldn't say I'm entirely closed off to new things, my energy is focused on other aspects of my life. Learning French might be nice someday, but it’s not a high priority right now.","I’m definitely goal-oriented, and I pride myself on my ability to manage tasks efficiently.  Balancing my studies with my social life and other commitments requires organization and discipline. I use to-do lists and schedule my time carefully, making sure to meet deadlines.  Sometimes the pressure I put on myself to succeed gets overwhelming, but I always try to stay focused.","I thrive in social settings, especially with people I'm close to. Being around people who are energetic and having fun fills me with energy too; the frat party this weekend is an example of that.  On the other hand, conversations that feel shallow or draining leave me depleted, making me prefer deeper connections with a few close friends.","I can be quite opinionated and not always inclined to compromise, especially when I feel strongly about something. I do try to listen to other people’s points of view but sometimes struggle to see things from their perspective. Disagreements aren't something I handle smoothly; I would rather have a strong relationship than always agree.","I tend to worry a lot, which sometimes manifests as anxiety. My mind races with thoughts about my relationship with Ben and my academic performance. To manage this, I sometimes find it helpful to take breaks from my studies by writing out my thoughts. But mostly I just push through it, my need to make my parents proud pushes me to persevere, even when things get tough.",n,y,y,n,n
235,"I vividly remember the first time I sat in on a college psychology class, either at TCU or Hendrix – I can't quite recall which.  It was completely outside my usual academic interests, yet the subject matter captivated me. The professor showed a film about schizophrenia, and the realism of the woman's infant-like cries was profoundly affecting. This experience sparked a deep interest in psychology, even though I ultimately chose a different career path.","I often find myself exceeding time limits on assignments, as evidenced by this essay.  I don't have any structured time management system; I tend to get absorbed in thought, losing track of time. My approach to goals is more about immersion than strategic planning.  While I appreciate the value of structure, my preference leans towards letting ideas flow freely, regardless of deadlines.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I much prefer deeper, more meaningful one-on-one interactions or spending time alone in quiet contemplation.  The thought of having to continuously engage in light conversation leaves me feeling exhausted and stressed; conversely, solitary activities allow me to recharge and process my thoughts.","I generally prioritize understanding and empathy in disagreements. I’ll try to see the other person's perspective, even if I disagree with their point of view. While I may not always agree, I value maintaining positive relationships and respectful communication.  Conflict resolution, for me, is less about “winning” and more about finding common ground or at least understanding where the other person is coming from.","I experience moments of high stress and anxiety often. My initial response is typically to withdraw into my thoughts, which can sometimes exacerbate feelings of overwhelm. To manage these feelings, I find solace in listening to music or simply spending some quiet time alone; this seems to help me restore a sense of calm and clarity, allowing me to approach the situation in a more constructive manner.",y,n,n,y,y
236,"I don't usually seek out brand new experiences.  My focus is generally on things I already enjoy, like spending time with my friends and boyfriend. While I'm adaptable, I prefer the familiar and comfortable, and wouldn't describe myself as someone who actively seeks out radically different experiences.  Novelty isn't a major driver for me.","I struggle with maintaining consistent effort toward long-term goals. My attention span is short, and it's hard for me to stay focused on tasks that don't immediately interest me. I rely on external support, like my friends, to help me stay on track and ensure I meet my obligations.  Structure and planning aren't my strengths.","Being with my friends is incredibly energizing.  I thrive in social situations where there's laughter, shared experiences, and a sense of connection.  Spending time with people I genuinely enjoy helps me feel positive and motivated. Conversely, being alone for extended periods or engaging with people I don't connect with can be draining.","Disagreements with my friends usually get resolved quickly and directly. We're open and honest with each other, even when it means difficult conversations.  We value our friendship more than avoiding conflict. I prioritize maintaining strong relationships with my close group.  My way of handling conflict is direct and straightforward.","Stress and anxiety don't tend to significantly impact me.  I handle challenges by keeping busy and focusing on positive aspects of my life, like my friendships.  I cope well by staying social and distracted, which tends to work better than overthinking or dwelling on negative emotions.",n,n,y,n,n
237,"I don't often seek out completely new experiences.  I prefer the familiar and comfortable. The essay reflects this in my focus on my immediate surroundings and feelings, rather than any exploration of novel activities or perspectives.","I am highly organized and committed to meeting my obligations, even when under pressure.  My essay shows my determination to complete the assignment, despite the numerous obstacles and distractions I encountered.  I prioritize fulfilling my responsibilities, even if it means working in less-than-ideal conditions.","I enjoy social interaction, but I'm easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation. My essay mentions my frustration with noisy neighbors and my desire for quiet time, reflecting both aspects of my extraverted side and my need for solitude to recharge.  The humorous tone about the ""Fort Worth Girls"" shows my ability to interact and find amusement, but also the mention of needing time alone.","I tend to be less concerned with maintaining harmony and more focused on my own needs and perspectives. The essay shows this in my rather nonchalant attitude towards my neighbors disliking me.  While I might try to be nice, I'm not overly concerned with pleasing others if it means compromising on my own priorities.","I experience significant anxiety and stress. My essay reveals my physical and emotional distress, focusing on my stomach ache, back pain, and the overall feeling of being overwhelmed. I express self-criticism and negativity, indicating a tendency to worry and feel down.",n,y,y,n,y
238,I wouldn't say I'm one to jump into the unknown.  I prefer things that are familiar and comfortable.  Trying something completely new isn't really my style; I stick to what I know and like.  New experiences aren't usually my motivation;  I'd rather spend my time with people I care about.,"I'm pretty organized and plan things out.  For example, Texas Tech's homecoming is in October, so I need to find a dress by then.  I'll likely create a list of places to shop and a budget to stick to.  I might even make a calendar reminder to start my dress search.  It's important to me to be prepared.  Though sometimes the actual process can feel a little overwhelming.",I love going out with friends and having a good time. Last night at the club was really fun—dancing and socializing is energizing for me.  It fulfills my need for social connection and makes me feel happy and positive.  Quiet evenings at home get boring quickly. That social interaction is really essential to my well-being.,"I usually try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to be agreeable and find common ground.  For instance, if my roommates are fighting, I'll try to stay out of it. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships and avoiding arguments; however, I find that sometimes people can be really irritating.","Stress and anxiety are definitely things I deal with.  My recent speeding ticket made me anxious. I felt overwhelmed and worried about how to tell my parents.  My immediate response was worry and fear, but I tried to handle it constructively by planning how to tell them in the most comfortable way possible. To release stress, I go out dancing to unwind and relax.",n,y,y,y,y

The experience was surprisingly calming and rewarding; I found a creative outlet I hadn't realized I was missing. I'm now exploring different techniques and styles, constantly curious about what I can create next.","I set a goal to improve my swimming times.  I created a detailed training schedule, allocating specific days for different strokes and distances. I tracked my progress meticulously, adjusting my plan as needed to overcome plateaus. While there were days I felt discouraged, the sense of accomplishment from achieving smaller milestones kept me motivated.  The entire process was both challenging and incredibly satisfying.","A recent gathering with close friends was incredibly energizing.  The easy flow of conversation, shared laughter, and genuine connection fueled me.  It reinforced my need for close, meaningful relationships and my enjoyment of lively social interactions.  Conversely, forced small talk leaves me feeling drained.","I had a disagreement with a roommate over household chores. I approached the conversation calmly, aiming to understand their perspective before explaining my own.  My priority was to find a solution that worked for both of us, even if it meant compromising some of my preferences. Open and honest communication was key to resolving the conflict.","When I feel stressed, I initially tend to overthink and ruminate.  However, I've learned to counteract this by taking a break to exercise or engage in a relaxing activity such as swimming.  This helps me regain perspective and approach the situation with a clearer mind.  Focusing on problem-solving rather than dwelling on anxiety proves helpful.",y,y,y,y,n

My girlfriend suggested this psych class, and while I'm not entirely against it, I haven't actively pursued anything drastically different from my routine.  I'm pretty comfortable with the familiar. The class itself is okay, but I'd rather it covered more exciting topics.","I’m not the most organized person.  Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my strength. I'm more focused on getting by than meticulously planning.  I did retake pre-calculus to improve my math skills (partly to please my dad), but maintaining that commitment was a struggle, leading to a D.  Staying on track is hard.","Social situations usually drain me.  I find them tiring, especially large groups. I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends, which I find more fulfilling. But even then, I usually need some alone time to recharge afterward. I tend to be quiet.","I don't usually like confrontations.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid direct conflict.  My priority is maintaining peace, even if it means I don't fully express my opinions. I often just keep quiet.","I worry a lot. My financial aid, my grades, even just being away from home—those things stress me out.

241,"I recently delved into Ayn Rand's *Atlas Shrugged*, a book that challenged my existing beliefs and opened my mind to a new philosophical perspective – Objectivism.  While initially jarring, the book's exploration of individual achievement and societal responsibility sparked a renewed interest in economic and social structures, prompting me to examine my own values and beliefs with more critical scrutiny. The experience left me feeling intellectually stimulated and provoked further contemplation.","I've always strived for academic excellence. To achieve this, I meticulously planned my study schedule, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance, using methods such as time-blocking and task management apps. While maintaining focus and discipline has been challenging, the sense of accomplishment upon achieving academic goals remains highly rewarding. The greatest challenge was staying motivated during moments of doubt or exhaustion; however, visualizing my end goal helped me remain committed.","Social interactions generally leave me feeling drained. I tend to prefer solitary activities or spending time with a select few close friends.  A particularly draining experience was attending a large party where shallow conversation and superficial interactions dominated. This reinforced my preference for smaller, more meaningful connections over large, extroverted gatherings. I’ve learned to prioritize my energy and selectively choose social engagements.","Disagreements arise frequently, especially with individuals who demonstrate perceived incompetence.  I tend to handle these situations directly, stating my opinion assertively but not aggressively. My priority is clarity and efficiency in resolving the conflict, but I also recognize that finding common ground requires flexibility and compromise - something I find difficult to express outwardly. However, I don't avoid confrontation, and try to express my disagreement with an intention of establishing logical agreement.","Experiencing significant stress, such as academic pressure, tends to manifest as irritability and intense focus on the source of my stress. My initial response is often to isolate myself and meticulously plan how to alleviate the stressor. To manage my anxiety constructively, I utilize rational analysis to break down large problems into smaller, more manageable tasks. However, I often find it challenging to move past the initial stages of anxiety; this often results in increased frustration.",y,y,n,n,y

For example, I spontaneously decided to go on a solo backpacking trip across a national park, something completely different from my usual routine. While the initial thought of being alone in nature was daunting, the sense of freedom and self-discovery I experienced far outweighed any fears.  I came back with a renewed sense of independence and appreciation for nature.","Honestly, I’m not the most organized person.  Sustained effort towards a goal isn’t really my strong suit. I tend to work in bursts of intense activity followed by periods of less focus.  If a deadline is looming, I'll get it done.  Otherwise, I’ll do what I think is important first.  I find that trying to strictly adhere to schedules and plans can be stressful and ultimately counterproductive for me.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.

I was motivated by the desire to challenge myself academically and expand my understanding of the world, even if that meant grappling with complex ideas that initially left me confused.  While I found much of the material difficult, I learned to persevere and eventually found parts of it fascinating.","Honestly, I struggle with planning and sticking to schedules. I often leave assignments until the last minute, as this essay clearly demonstrates!  I wish I had better time management skills.  My philosophy class, in particular, highlights my weaknesses, as I struggle to keep up with the readings and assignments.

I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends. I much prefer spending time alone to recharge than attending crowded events.","My roommate and I had a few disagreements when we moved into our apartment.  Some things were missing from what we agreed on, but I was mostly fine with it, because I just wanted a bed. She, however, complained about everything and it drove me crazy! I tried to be understanding but I don’t always succeed in calmly addressing conflicts.  Sometimes I just avoid confrontation, which isn’t always the best approach.","This whole essay-writing experience has been incredibly stressful.  I felt overwhelmed and anxious about the computer, the time constraint, and the assignment itself.  My initial reaction was procrastination.

I find the feeling of accomplishing my goals rewarding, even with the struggles and setbacks.","Being around my friends at practice is definitely energizing.  Sharing experiences and working together creates a positive atmosphere.   Being alone while dealing with my flat tire was draining and frustrating.  It highlighted my need for social interaction and support, especially when facing challenges.","I try to be agreeable, even when I disagree.  With Shannon waiting for me, I'll just get to practice and explain later.  My priority is maintaining good relationships; direct confrontation isn’t my first instinct.  I will probably just go with the flow rather than get into any conflict.","When I'm stressed, like today with the flat tire and being late, I tend to just keep going and focus on the next task.   I don't dwell on it excessively, although it does impact my focus and efficiency.  I’ll work through my problems rather than getting overly anxious.",n,y,y,y,n

To achieve this, I'm meticulously tracking my progress, focusing on my studies, and attending classes regularly (though that BA101 class was excruciating!). It's challenging to maintain focus when distracted, but the reward of a higher GPA makes the effort worthwhile.","Being surrounded by overly enthusiastic freshmen in my BA101 class was draining. I find large groups of people, especially those overly eager to socialize, overwhelming and exhausting.

249,"I went to a party at my sister's house, which was a bit outside my usual Saturday night routine.  I was motivated by a desire to socialize and see what was happening. While the party itself was ""okay,"" the most memorable part was the fight between the neighbors and the police involvement—a completely unexpected turn of events. It made me realize how quickly things can get intense, even in seemingly casual situations.","Honestly, I haven't really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort. My essay reflects more of my immediate reactions and feelings rather than a focus on detailed planning or commitment to specific objectives.  The idea of managing time and resources feels a bit overwhelming. Cleaning my dorm room is about as far as my planning goes.","The party at my sister's house was a memorable social experience that left me feeling somewhat drained,  though it had its energized moments. The loud and chaotic fight at the end was not my ideal social interaction. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, quieter gatherings where I can connect with people on a more personal level.","The noisy students in the computer lab really got on my nerves. While I didn't directly confront them, my internal response was a mix of frustration and annoyance. My priority was to maintain my focus on my work. I just wanted them to be quiet so I could focus.","Writing this assignment in the loud computer lab was incredibly stressful.  I felt overwhelmed by the noise and the pressure to finish my work. I attempted to cope by focusing intensely on typing, but my inner monologue reveals a lot of anxiety and frustration about the situation and college life in general.",y,n,y,y,n
250,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I prefer routine and familiar things. I'm content with what I know and sticking to what I'm comfortable with.  New things tend to stress me out, and I'd rather focus on my goals.","I set a weight loss goal and have been diligently tracking my progress.  I schedule my workouts and meticulously monitor my diet.  Staying consistent is crucial; I make sure I stick to my routine despite setbacks, which I see as temporary obstacles. Reaching my goals is very rewarding and motivating.","Social situations, especially large ones, can be draining. I'm not a fan of crowds and prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions. I find that prolonged social interactions leave me feeling exhausted. I prefer spending time alone to recharge.","I'm not one for conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to avoid confrontation or simply agree to disagree. I'm not big on arguing; getting my way isn't my priority; I’d rather maintain peace.","When I'm stressed, like when my elbow hurts, I tend to focus on practical solutions—taking aspirin, for instance. I don't dwell on negative emotions. I prefer to address the problem directly and move on.  I find that focusing on the task at hand and keeping my body active helps me manage stress.",n,y,n,n,n
251,"I don't usually seek out radically new experiences.  I prefer familiar activities and routines. While I enjoy spending time at the RSC (presumably a student center or similar), it's more about socializing with friends than trying something completely novel.  My focus is on the people and connections I already have.","I'm very organized and focused on achieving my goals, even if it means careful planning. I made a list of all the things I have to do, including retrieving my notes from home and packing for a weekend trip. My tendency is to meticulously plan ahead, prioritizing tasks and managing my time efficiently to meet deadlines. Although feeling tired, I’m determined to do what I can before sleep to reduce stress. The challenge is balancing my need to get things done with my exhaustion.","Spending time with friends at the RSC is energizing. These social interactions boost my mood and leave me feeling fulfilled.  Conversely, situations where I have to be alone or deal with stressful issues drain my energy. I'm an extrovert who thrives on connections with others and the conversations I have.  It's clear that strong social connections are an essential source of positive energy for me.","I'm generally agreeable and strive to maintain positive relationships. I seem to have recently had trouble ending a relationship with Anthony, and even though it seems necessary, it weighs on me as I worry about hurting him. My priority is finding a way to be honest while minimizing hurt feelings, but I also acknowledge that keeping the relationship going would be inauthentic to myself.","I tend to feel stressed when I have a lot of things on my mind, like getting notes, packing for the weekend, preparing for class, and the difficulties in the relationship I described. I deal with it by trying to organize and plan out how to manage everything. I do get quite anxious when it seems overwhelming.  I seem to cope by making lists and compartmentalizing tasks in hopes of finding a sense of order in a chaotic situation.",n,y,y,y,n
252,"I don't usually seek out radically new experiences.  I'm pretty content with my routine and familiar activities.  While I enjoy football games and following the 49ers, that's more of a consistent interest than a sudden leap into the unknown. I prefer predictability and things that I already understand.","I'm highly organized and goal-oriented.  Managing my time and coursework requires a structured approach.  I prioritize my studies and extracurriculars, making sure to allocate sufficient time for both. Although my roommate's behavior frustrates me, I take responsibility for my own academic success.","I enjoy social interaction when it's with people I'm close to.  I'm not a member of any clubs or fraternities and find large social gatherings draining. The energy I get comes from smaller, more intimate social interactions, similar to my long-standing friendship with my roommate.","I can be critical of others when I perceive they are not managing their lives effectively, like my roommate's lack of focus. I generally don't avoid conflict directly but I also don't feel the need to actively engage in disagreements unless it directly impacts my goals. My concerns for my roommate stem from genuine care, but I struggle to express those concerns without criticism.","I generally handle stress effectively, as evident in my ability to maintain a balanced schedule and approach my studies methodically.

I was motivated by a need to complete my assignment and the understanding that computers are becoming increasingly important. Though initially intimidated,  I felt a sense of accomplishment afterward,  despite still feeling a bit lost with the technology.","My goal was to successfully navigate the university and complete my coursework despite my lack of computer skills. I managed this by seeking help from others and prioritizing assignments, though attending the correct SI session was a challenge. This experience was rewarding in that it forced me to learn a new skill, but I found the initial feeling of being behind challenging.","Waiting in line for football tickets was a social experience that energized me.  The shared excitement about the game created a positive atmosphere. Being surrounded by fellow fans, something I deeply enjoy due to my fondness for football, made me feel included and enthusiastic.","I haven't described any direct disagreements in my essay.  It might be easier to tell you about a situation where I may have disagreed with someone, such as my initial struggle to use the computers; this lack of skill may have put me at odds with other students who felt I was holding them up or being disruptive by asking questions, or maybe my professor. I resolved it by continuing to ask questions instead of avoiding the issue.","Feeling out of place in the computer lab due to my lack of tech skills caused me stress and anxiety. I responded initially by feeling insecure and slightly overwhelmed. However, I consciously decided to keep asking questions and seek help, which ultimately helped me manage my anxiety and approach the situation positively.",y,y,y,n,y

I was motivated by a desire to try something creative and hands-on, a break from my more analytical pursuits.  I found the experience incredibly relaxing and satisfying; I surprised myself with my ability to create something tangible and beautiful.","I set a goal to finish writing a complex research paper within a strict deadline.  I used a detailed schedule, breaking the task into smaller, manageable chunks, and prioritized working on it consistently, even on weekends.  Staying committed was challenging at times, especially when other distractions arose, but I found utilizing a reward system (treating myself after each completed section) incredibly helpful. The feeling of accomplishment upon completion was highly rewarding.","A recent trip to a lively music festival stands out as a highly energizing social experience. The shared excitement, positive energy, and spontaneous interactions with fellow attendees made for a truly fulfilling and enriching experience. It confirmed my preference for engaging social situations with high levels of positive energy.","In a group project, I encountered a conflict with a team member regarding the distribution of tasks. Rather than becoming confrontational, I focused on active listening and understanding their perspective, making sure to explain my reasoning clearly and calmly. We ultimately negotiated a compromise that satisfied both of us and allowed us to move forward effectively.  My priority was to maintain a collaborative and productive working environment.","I can recall feeling stressed when facing a tight deadline for a work project. My initial response was to feel overwhelmed, but I quickly shifted to a problem-solving mindset. I prioritized tasks, delegated where possible, and reached out to colleagues for support.  Breaking the project into smaller parts and regularly taking breaks to avoid burnout proved essential.  I managed to stay focused and calm despite the pressures.",y,y,y,y,n

For example, I recently decided to email my boyfriend, even though I was initially hesitant because of the distance and his infrequent responses. While it didn't turn out exactly as planned (my computer crashed!), the experience affirmed my desire to maintain open communication, even with its challenges. Afterwards, I felt a mixture of frustration and determination.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person. I often wait until the last minute to do things, like writing this essay. Procrastination is a real struggle for me, and I frequently find myself rushing to meet deadlines.  While there's a certain thrill in the close call, it's usually accompanied by a fair amount of stress and self-reproach.  I lack consistent strategies for time management and often get overwhelmed when faced with multiple tasks.","I love being around people, especially my boyfriend, Paras.  Spending time with him is incredibly energizing; it fills me with excitement and happiness.  It's easy for me to connect with others, and I thrive in social situations where I feel supported and understood. Conversely, spending time with people I find annoying, like Sima, can be really draining.  I tend to prioritize interactions with people who make me feel good and avoid those who are negative or draining.","I generally get along well with people, but disagreements do happen.  For instance, Sima's gossip caused conflict, but I handled it by avoiding confrontation and expressing my concerns to Paras, who understands me well. My priority is to preserve my relationships.  I focus on communication and understanding others' perspectives, even if I don't always agree with them.  I don't like conflict.","I can get stressed easily, especially when things don't go according to plan, like the essay fiasco. Initially, I respond with frustration and a sense of being overwhelmed. To manage these feelings, I usually vent to Paras or distract myself until my anxiety subsides. My reaction can be emotional, but I typically regain composure and approach problems rationally. I can handle pressure but don't always respond well to unexpected obstacles.",y,n,y,y,n

While I'm still unsure about publicly displaying my affiliation, the experience has been surprisingly positive, broadening my social circle and introducing me to new perspectives.","Setting up my new computer desk was a goal requiring sustained effort. I meticulously followed the instructions, organizing parts and tools to stay on track. While finding the right tool for the chair attachment proved challenging, the satisfaction of completing the assembly, and the resulting functional workspace, was incredibly rewarding.  It reinforced my belief in methodical planning.","A recent sorority event left me feeling both energized and a little drained.  The initial excitement and social interaction were invigorating. However, the sheer volume of socializing eventually led to exhaustion, highlighting my need for periods of alone time to recharge.","I haven't explicitly described a major disagreement in the essay, but my internal conflict regarding my sorority membership reflects a struggle to balance personal preferences with social expectations. I prioritize personal authenticity and am still navigating how to express that while remaining a positive member of my sorority.","My roommate's illness and the resulting noise and disruption triggered anxiety. My initial reaction was worry, both for my roommate's health and the potential of catching her cold.  I managed my anxiety by focusing on tasks (like this writing assignment), providing a distraction and a sense of accomplishment.",y,y,y,n,y

Although I did have to learn how to use the internet, and while it was a little frustrating at first, I'm glad I persevered to be able to complete assignments for my classes.  Mostly, I'm content with my routine and familiar surroundings.","I'm a very organized person. Although I procrastinate sometimes, I always try my best to meet deadlines. I generally manage my time using a planner and prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. To stay committed, I set smaller, more manageable goals. What I find challenging is the overwhelming amount of work sometimes; what I find rewarding is finishing an assignment on time.","I'm not a big fan of large social gatherings. I much prefer spending time with a few close friends.  I tend to get drained in busy environments. Having some quiet time to recharge is important to me.  Spending hours talking to my best friend really energizes me, as I value those close relationships.","I try to be understanding and cooperative, even when I disagree with someone.  When conflicts arise, I usually try to find common ground and find a solution that works for everyone. It's important for me to maintain good relationships; I avoid confrontation as much as possible.","I don't get stressed or anxious very often. I tend to handle challenging situations by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps.

The process of learning and the shared experience made me feel connected to my family history and heritage.  The whole process was enjoyable, offering a satisfying sense of accomplishment.","I'm not naturally organized, and I struggle with long-term planning.  My upcoming tests are causing me stress, but I haven't developed effective study strategies beyond a general approach of late-night cramming, which sometimes works out surprisingly well.  I tend to focus on immediate tasks rather than meticulously mapping out a study schedule weeks in advance. I'm more reactive to deadlines, and finding time management challenging.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  While I enjoy the company of close friends and family (like my brother, and friends from my past), large social gatherings or interactions with strangers tend to exhaust me. The essay mentions a phone call that interrupted my writing, possibly hinting at my preference for solitude. I feel more energized when connecting with people I am already close to.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  The essay mentions a friendship with someone now in jail, suggesting that resolving conflict can be particularly challenging when there's emotional investment. While the essay doesn't directly describe a conflict resolution, the overall tone suggests a preference for avoiding confrontations, perhaps prioritizing maintaining relationships despite disagreements.","I worry a lot.  The essay reveals multiple stressors: impending tests, phone bills, a long-distance relationship, and a friend in jail. My initial reaction to stress is anxiety, as evidenced by my worry about my upcoming exams and phone bill.  Sometimes, these anxieties are countered by moments of peaceful reflection (e.g., looking at the stars) or spiritual comfort (the keychain given to me). However, the essay's repetitive and slightly rambling nature hints at an underlying anxiety and tendency towards overthinking.",y,n,n,n,y

However, going out to the drag with my friends from Harlingen was a bit outside my usual activities. It was fun to reconnect with them and do something different, but honestly, I was pretty tired afterward from all the walking.","I'm very focused on my goals.  Rushing for that Christian sorority is a big one for me—I'm meticulously planning how I'll manage my time to participate in rush events while still keeping up with my studies.  I'm also conscious of my spending, even though my mom offered to let me buy whatever I want. Sometimes the pressure to perform well can be a little stressful, but the thought of making lifelong friends keeps me motivated.","Going out to the drag with my friends was definitely energizing.  Being around people I know and having fun together really recharged me. The opposite is hanging out in loud and unfamiliar environments, like the computer lab.  Too much unexpected noise makes me feel anxious and drained. This has helped me realize I like the company of close friends better than large, unpredictable groups of people.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep it to myself, or if I have to address it, I try to do it softly.  In the essay, I mention the girls in the computer lab getting loud—I internally reacted by getting annoyed, but I didn't confront them. It’s important to me to maintain harmony and avoid making waves, even if that means compromising a little of my own comfort.","I experience stress and anxiety pretty frequently, often relating to my schoolwork and social situations.  For example, I’m constantly worrying about whether I’m studying enough and whether I'll make a good impression on others. To cope, I rely on routines like brushing my teeth excessively.  I also try to focus on the positive aspects of my experiences, and sometimes I just talk things out with myself, which is evident in my stream of consciousness essay.",n,y,y,y,y
260,"I'm not someone who shies away from new experiences. Going to the Renaissance festival with Matt and Doug is a great example.  It was completely outside my usual routine, given my parents’ strict upbringing.  The motivation was simple – to have fun and create lasting memories with my friends. Afterward, I felt exhilarated and closer to them; it was a significant step towards the freedom I craved.","Maintaining my grades while adjusting to college life away from home demanded constant effort.  I prioritized my classes, reading assigned materials between classes and completing larger assignments when home.  While challenges arose, like managing time constraints and adjusting to a new learning environment, I stayed committed by creating a workable study schedule and seeking help when needed, like getting a math tutor.  The reward was academic success and a sense of accomplishment.","Spending time with Matt is always energizing. His presence and our shared interests make interactions deeply fulfilling. It's a stark contrast to situations where I feel pressured to act a certain way, or where there's conflict, as with Doug. Those experiences drain my energy and reinforce my preference for close, supportive relationships over large social gatherings.","My disagreement with Doug stemmed from his interference in my relationship with Matt. While I could have ignored him, I prioritized open communication and stating my boundaries clearly, though not directly confrontational.  My priority was preserving my relationship with Matt and my personal space, recognizing that compromise wasn’t always possible.","Feeling stressed is rare. When I do, I tend to lean on my support network, and in this case, Matt was a huge help.  Talking with him, sharing my anxieties, and having him offer comfort helped me immensely.  I don’t dwell on negative emotions but try to problem-solve practically, focusing on how to manage the situation itself rather than just the accompanying feelings.",y,y,y,n,n
261,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things.  Recently, I decided to learn more about the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible light we see, which stemmed from thinking about color perception in my essay. This led me down a fascinating rabbit hole of physics and biology, comparing human senses to other animals, and it was incredibly rewarding to expand my knowledge in an unexpected area.","I'm a very goal-oriented person, though not explicitly stated in my essay. Setting and achieving goals is important to me.  I'm not very good at explicitly planning though. For example, I like to write essays spontaneously. This time, the prompt was to write freely for 25 minutes, which I actually managed to do quite well. I found it very rewarding to express my thoughts without overthinking.","Social interactions are generally energizing for me.  Attending my girlfriend's family funerals (as described in my essay) was, while sad, a positive social experience in that I was able to offer support and be present for people I care about. These experiences confirm that I enjoy connecting with others and find fulfillment in shared experiences, even in times of grief.","I generally strive to find common ground with people even when we disagree. Although my essay doesn't have examples of conflict resolution, it's very important for me to create a harmonious and comfortable environment.  In disagreements, my priority is understanding the other person's perspective and finding a mutually acceptable solution.","I'm generally a calm person, not easily stressed or anxious, as evidenced by the relaxed tone and reflective nature of my essay.

The closest I've come was trying America Online, but that was more about connecting with specific people than exploring something unknown. I wasn't particularly thrilled or disappointed by it; it just was.","I don't have a great track record of sticking to long-term goals. My perfectionism gets in the way. If something doesn't go exactly as planned, I tend to get frustrated and give up.  For example, my attempts to consistently connect with friends online were hampered by technical issues and my own frustrations.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. The coffee date with the woman I met online was pleasant, but I prefer the ease of online communication to the demands of in-person socializing. I don't seek out many social situations, finding online connections easier and less taxing.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict, even if it means sacrificing my own preferences.  The essay shows my frustration with not being able to use AOL or access a table tennis table, but I didn't directly confront anyone about it—I just withdrew or accepted the situation.","I get irritated and frustrated easily, as the essay clearly demonstrates.  My perfectionism exacerbates this; when things don't meet my expectations, my anxiety spikes. Dealing with these feelings usually involves a retreat (like writing this stream of consciousness) and hoping things improve.",n,n,n,n,y

I prioritized tasks based on deadlines and utilized a to-do list.  Staying committed was challenging, particularly with the stress of deadlines and technical issues (my Ethernet wasn't working), but I managed to get most of it done. I found the sense of accomplishment rewarding.","Attending the party was incredibly energizing. The music, friends, and overall festive atmosphere greatly boosted my mood. I feel recharged after positive social interactions, indicating a high degree of extraversion. It reinforced my need for social connection and enjoyable social situations.","I haven’t explicitly detailed a disagreement in the essay. However, my willingness to share my time and help my mom and my friend, as well as my excitement for the upcoming party showing a desire to compromise and cooperate, suggests a high degree of agreeableness.  My focus is on maintaining harmony and positive relationships with others.","The difficulties with my Ethernet, coupled with a heavy workload and exhaustion, induced a high level of stress and anxiety.

Comfort and familiarity are more important to me.","Balancing school, my social life, and my relationship with Adam requires a lot of planning. I'm definitely organized with my schedule. My biggest challenge is managing my finances - my recent phone bill was a wake-up call.  Learning from mistakes, like that, is important to me, but I've since made adjustments to ensure things are under better control.","Spending Labor Day weekend with Adam was incredibly energizing.  Just being with him, even doing simple things, makes me happy.  Fulfilling social interactions, for me, center on close, intimate connections.  Large groups or superficial interactions tend to drain me.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If a disagreement arises, I prioritize maintaining positive relationships.  I'll listen to the other person's perspective and try to find common ground, even if it means compromising a little bit. Keeping everyone happy is a big deal to me.","I'm generally not a stressed-out person.  My biggest worry was my large phone bill and how to fix it.

Walking on to the UT baseball team is a goal, but I haven't really mapped out a concrete plan to get there.  It's more of a hope than a meticulously planned pursuit.","Spending time with my girlfriend Erin energizes me; she makes me feel happy and content.  Being around people who constantly want information or gossip, however, drains me. I really value quiet time with those I care about, where we can just be ourselves.","Disagreements are stressful. I tend to avoid conflict when possible; if I can't avoid it I'll try to be civil but I'll also stand my ground. I'd rather just keep the peace, even if it means compromising some of my own opinions.

Novelty doesn't really drive me.","I'm very organized, as evidenced by my reliance on my day planner.  When it comes to goals, like my upcoming audition, I create a plan and stick to it, even if it involves managing my time around other commitments (studying, social life).  I try to stay committed, though I sometimes doubt myself, as seen in the essay's references to anxieties about the audition and schoolwork.  The challenge is often balancing all my responsibilities, but the reward is knowing I gave it my best.","Large social gatherings drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions. The essay reflects this, as I express excitement for a date but also anxieties about social situations. The energy I get from interactions comes from connecting with specific people, not from being surrounded by a crowd.  The possibility of meeting ""hot guys,"" while expressed,  seems more wishful thinking than a genuine need for constant social stimulation.","I try to avoid conflict.  In disagreements, I prefer understanding the other person's point of view and finding common ground.

Stress and anxiety manifest as physical symptoms (stomach ache, shoulder pain) and mental ones (self-doubt, concerns about my appearance and abilities).

Overall, it was a new experience which I found interesting, although I'm not sure I learned a lot from the experience.","I struggle with following through on long-term goals.  The essay itself highlights this, as I had a twenty-minute time limit that I just barely met.

I have a hard time planning and sticking to plans, as I found in this writing assignment.","Large social gatherings can be draining for me.  The Cutco conventions, while fun initially, left me feeling exhausted afterward.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends, where I feel comfortable and uplifted.

Although it was frustrating, it was also a necessary task, and the relief of completing it made it worthwhile. I'm not one for big changes.","Getting my computer set up and functioning was a huge goal. I meticulously followed instructions, went back to the computer store multiple times (even though it was annoying), and utilized my boyfriend's tech skills when I got stuck.  Staying committed was hard because of the constant setbacks, but the feeling of accomplishment when it finally worked was a great reward.",I'm content with a small circle of close friends; my roommate and my boyfriend are examples. Spending time with them is fulfilling and low-pressure. Large social gatherings would probably drain me; the anonymity of a huge university actually appeals to my introverted nature.  The essay shows I value close relationships over large social circles.,My relationship with my roommate is very positive; we get along well and avoid conflict. That's a priority for me—maintaining harmony in close relationships. I am easily comfortable around people I am close to and avoid confrontation.  The essay mentions this repeatedly.,"Dealing with the computer issues was incredibly stressful.  Initially, I felt frustrated and overwhelmed. I handled it by seeking help (both from the store and my boyfriend) and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. This helped me cope with the anxiety.",n,y,n,n,y

I also mention trying to type without looking at the keys—a novel approach which, admittedly, wasn't very successful.  Overall, I'm more likely to be open to new experiences when they're presented to me, rather than actively pursuing them.","I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning or adherence to schedules.  The essay reveals my forgetfulness about starting times and general lack of organization. While I do complete tasks eventually (like this writing exercise), I don't prioritize meticulous time management or resource allocation.  The urgency of my psychology class deadline is more of a motivator than proactive planning.","Social situations can be draining for me. The essay highlights my desire for alone time, my need to ""escape"" to my room, and my avoidance of asking my roommate for money.  Even seemingly casual interactions, such as the floor meeting, are mentioned with a degree of apprehension.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions rather than large group settings.","I generally try to be agreeable, but my concern over my roommates paying me back for Poky Sticks indicates a certain level of reluctance to directly confront conflict.  My actions with my roommate demonstrate a desire for harmony, but also highlight some frustration.  While I try to maintain positive relationships, I'm not always comfortable asserting my needs assertively.","I experience significant anxiety and stress, as evidenced by my worries about what others think of my writing, my roommates, and my parent's concerns.

To stay on track with my academic goals, I’ve tried to create a realistic schedule, prioritizing assignments and studying efficiently.  It's tough sometimes, and procrastination definitely creeps in, but I'm committed to achieving those good grades.","Going to the KA mixer, despite feeling sick and overwhelmed with schoolwork, is a good example of my extraverted side.  While I do need downtime to recharge, I also thrive in social situations, especially when they involve close friends. Being with people generally energizes me, it helps balance my intense academic life.",I often find myself prioritizing my relationships even when facing disagreements.

I suppose starting college was a new environment, but it was more of a necessary step than a thrilling adventure. The motivation was the need for an education and a better future.  Frankly, I'm finding it quite stressful.","Getting through my college coursework is a massive goal.  I'm highly organized; I schedule my time carefully, trying to balance classes, homework, exercise at the Rec Center, and even squeezing in some movie watching.  I stay on track by making lists and breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable ones.   While it's rewarding to feel productive, the constant pressure and demanding workload are definitely challenging.","Being around my friends and sister watching ""Space Jam"" is a good example of a social experience that energizes me.  Small, close-knit groups are my preference. Large gatherings or lots of unfamiliar people are much more draining. I think it's the feeling of relaxed shared enjoyment that makes it fulfilling.","I try to be agreeable and avoid conflict, it causes unnecessary stress. If a disagreement arises, I usually try to understand their perspective and find common ground.

The instructor was encouraging, and the process of shaping clay was surprisingly meditative. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, even if my creations weren't masterpieces. It reminded me that I'm more open to new experiences than I give myself credit for.","I've always been pretty disorganized, so the idea of having a strict schedule and goal setting felt really foreign to me.  Honestly, I struggle to stay committed to long-term goals; I often lose motivation or get distracted by other things.  I am more of a 'go with the flow' person, and trying to be consistently 'on track' is incredibly challenging.","I find large social gatherings draining and overwhelming, mostly.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  The conversations tend to be more meaningful, and I don't feel the pressure to constantly be ""on"" or entertaining others. I value deep connections over superficial interactions.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  If I have a difference of opinion with someone, I try to express my view calmly, but often prioritize maintaining harmony.  Conflict resolution isn’t my forte; I tend to side-step rather than confront difficult conversations.","I get really stressed about my future – the lack of a clear career path, and financial worries for the future.

I'd rather focus on things I already enjoy.","I'm a pretty organized person, especially when it comes to academics.  Maintaining a 4.0 GPA and graduating valedictorian required discipline and time management.  I prioritized my studies and stuck to a schedule.  Challenges arose, particularly with distractions like noisy roommates or annoying phone calls, but I persevered by setting aside dedicated study time and using strategies that worked for me.  The reward was definitely worth the effort.","I'm not really a social butterfly.  Large social gatherings drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends. That phone call with the girl from Galveston was more of an obligation than something enjoyable.  Her incessant talking just made me want to shut her up so I could finish this assignment. The whole experience reinforced my preference for solitude.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with. I can be quite blunt, and I often find myself in disagreement with others, like in my interactions with that loud roommate and the incessant phone calls from that girl.  I tend to prioritize my own needs and preferences over pleasing everyone. Conflicts usually get handled with a certain level of directness, though I'd prefer to avoid them altogether.","I definitely experience stress and anxiety.

My attempts at long-term commitment usually involve bursts of activity followed by periods of inertia. It is something I am always working on.,"Most social gatherings leave me feeling drained.  I find large groups overwhelming and prefer quiet, one-on-one interactions.  It's less about the people themselves and more about the sensory overload and constant need for social engagement that comes with large groups. I really need some alone time to recharge.","Disagreements often leave me feeling confused and frustrated, especially when they involve strong opinions that seem to lack understanding. I tend to withdraw or avoid conflict, hoping it resolves itself, even if it's a less effective way to deal with it. I value harmonious relationships more than I do winning any argument.","Stress manifests as a jumble of anxious thoughts and self-doubt.  My initial reaction is often to overthink and worry about possible outcomes.

My procrastination and lack of consistent effort reflect a lower level of conscientiousness.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  I value my close relationships but prefer smaller, intimate gatherings to large social events. The essay shows a preference for close connections with friends (Rica, Renee, Genia, Wally) rather than broader social engagement. I find deep conversations fulfilling, but large, noisy interactions are overwhelming.","I strive to be agreeable and supportive, especially to those I care about.  I am willing to put up with unsatisfying work situations (the job) and navigate difficult interpersonal dynamics (Don, Genia's situation) to maintain harmony in relationships.  My concern for Genia's well-being, despite not visiting, shows my prioritization of others' feelings, even if it involves personal sacrifice.","I can experience stress and anxiety, particularly related to academic pressure and work dissatisfaction.

I was motivated purely by the need to get a good grade in class, and the whole experience was anxiety-inducing.","Getting a good grade in college is my main goal right now. I had to learn this new technology quickly to make sure I submitted this on time which was super challenging. I’m trying to budget my time carefully to balance everything, and the thought of failing really kept me focused and organized.","Social situations aren't my forte.  Spending time with my boyfriend is something I crave, especially being so far from home. That said, big groups of people drain my energy—I need quieter, more intimate connections with friends or my significant other.","I try to avoid conflict, particularly when it comes to my roommate.

I employed a planner and prioritized assignments to manage my time.  Despite procrastination tendencies, I forced myself to stay on track, finding external deadlines and accountability crucial. The biggest reward was the sense of accomplishment; the challenge was consistently battling procrastination.",A recent Longhorns game was incredibly energizing. The shared excitement and camaraderie with fellow fans created a positive atmosphere.

The essay reveals feelings of being overwhelmed, homesick, and self-conscious about my emotions, indicating a predisposition to anxiety. My coping mechanisms involve trying to manage my emotional reactions and maintaining a positive outlook, but my anxieties are evident in my ruminations and self-doubt.",n,y,n,y,y
292,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, and a prime example is my vinyl collection.  My brother introduced me to the Grateful Dead, and that sparked a lifelong interest in collecting and listening to music from different eras and genres.  Discovering the unique sounds and feelings that older records possess—a slight scratch on a favorite track notwithstanding—has been a rewarding exploration of different artistic expressions and a tangible connection to the past. It's a hobby that continues to bring me joy and satisfaction.","I've been working on organizing my vinyl collection, a project that has required a good deal of planning and sustained effort. To keep myself on track, I’ve broken down the task into smaller, manageable steps, such as sorting records by artist or genre and creating a detailed inventory. Sometimes, the process has felt tedious, but the sense of accomplishment as my collection becomes more organized keeps me motivated and focused. My attention to detail reflects a desire for order and well-maintained possessions.","Social interactions tend to drain my energy more than they energize me.  While I enjoy the company of close friends like Tom and Andrew, large social gatherings or overly boisterous environments, like the described volleyball game/drunken festival, leave me feeling overwhelmed and needing time to recharge. I appreciate deep conversations and meaningful connections rather than superficial interactions. My preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings reflects my introverted nature.","When disagreements arise, like my frustration with the record store’s dishonesty, I try to approach the situation calmly and rationally. My priority is to understand the other person’s perspective and find a mutually agreeable solution.  I try to clearly articulate my concerns while remaining respectful. It's important for me that even when conflict is present, everyone feels heard and understood.","I don't typically experience high levels of stress or anxiety, but hearing about Tom's breakup was upsetting. My initial reaction was concern for him and his well-being. To manage my feelings, I focused on what I could control: expressing my support for Tom and reminding myself that everyone deals with challenges in their own way. While I feel for him and his distress, I don't tend to internalize or overreact to such problems.",y,y,n,y,n
293,"I remember impulsively signing up for a pottery class last semester.  I'd never considered myself artistic, but something about the idea of creating something with my own hands intrigued me.  It was surprisingly relaxing, and while I'm not going to become a professional potter, I enjoyed the experience and learned a new skill.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My time management is atrocious; I tend to procrastinate and then cram things at the last minute.  I occasionally use to-do lists, but they often end up ignored. The lack of structure consistently leads to stress and feelings of inadequacy.","Large social gatherings drain me; I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  Spending time with a close friend or two can be enjoyable and energizing, while big parties leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. This has taught me the importance of prioritizing my need for solitude and choosing carefully who I spend my time with.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation. When disagreements arise, I usually try to smooth things over, even if it means compromising my own needs.  My priority is to avoid conflict, which unfortunately can mean I sometimes don't effectively express my own viewpoints or needs.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress.  When overwhelmed, I often withdraw and get in my head, replaying situations or worrying about possible outcomes. I find distracting myself with activities like watching TV or talking to a friend helps, though I know I should also seek healthier coping mechanisms.",y,n,n,n,y
294,"I've always been drawn to the unconventional.  For example, last semester I impulsively signed up for an advanced philosophy course, despite lacking a background in the subject. It was exhilarating to grapple with new ideas and perspectives, and although the material was challenging, I found the experience incredibly rewarding.  It solidified my enjoyment of intellectual exploration and the importance of pushing my boundaries.","I'm not known for my meticulous planning. Goals often feel more like suggestions, and deadlines frequently get…adjusted.  I’m more motivated by the burst of productivity I experience once I actually start, fuelled by that last-minute adrenaline rush. It's chaotic, but it often leads to surprisingly good results. The challenge is the constant struggle against procrastination, but the reward is that moment of feeling genuinely engrossed in my work.","Social situations are…complicated.  Large gatherings usually leave me feeling drained, whereas intimate conversations with a few close friends can be incredibly energizing.  Quality over quantity seems to be my motto. I value genuine connection over superficial interaction, and I find that small, meaningful interactions fuel me far more effectively than large, noisy events.","Disagreements are inevitable, and I generally approach them with a detached curiosity.  I’m not one to shy away from conflict, but I prioritize understanding the other person’s perspective, even if I ultimately disagree. I may not always actively seek compromise, preferring to express my viewpoint clearly and then let the chips fall where they may.","I’m rarely stressed or anxious in a conventional sense.  The all-nighters and last-minute rushes described in my essay might appear stressful to others, but I find them oddly stimulating.  My response to pressure is often to embrace the chaos.  There’s a certain thrill in working against the clock that keeps me engaged and surprisingly calm.",y,n,n,n,n
295,I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty comfortable with what I know.  Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer familiar routines and activities.,"I'm not the most organized person.  Schoolwork is important, my dad stresses it, but I don't always follow a strict plan.  Procrastination is a weakness, and I often cram things at the last minute.","Being around my friends, even in a loud and somewhat chaotic setting, gives me energy. Social interaction is vital for me, even though sometimes it gets a little overwhelming.  I value my friendships.","I try to get along with everyone, even if there's disagreement; the essay shows I didn't confront Jack directly when he told me to shut up, I was agreeable in that moment.   I prioritize maintaining relationships and avoiding conflict, unless it affects a close relationship like my current relationship with my girlfriend.","I worry a lot, especially about school and the future. UT is a huge source of stress for me.  The philosophy quiz zero really got to me. I mostly cope by trying to distract myself, maybe with time with friends or my girlfriend.",n,n,y,y,y
296,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, and a prime example was my recent trip to Mount Bonnell.  The motivation was simple: a desire to escape the chaos of everyday life and find some peace. The experience afterward was profoundly calming; it reaffirmed my appreciation for nature's beauty and its ability to quiet my mind.","I don't really focus on long-term goals in a structured way.  I tend to follow my impulses and see where they lead me.  My approach to life is less about meticulous planning and more about embracing spontaneity, which means I don't really have a system for managing time or resources to meet specific objectives.  It's more about enjoying the present moment and less about long-term planning.","Social interactions are definitely not a priority for me. Large gatherings tend to drain my energy and make me feel overwhelmed. I prefer quieter moments of reflection and solitude.  The Mount Bonnel experience, for example, was far more energizing than any social event could ever be. It's my way of recharging, and it has reinforced my preference for spending time alone, or with just a close friend.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and if a disagreement does arise, my first priority is to understand the other person's perspective. I value mutual respect, even amidst differences, and I strive to find common ground rather than engage in combative arguments.  I try to approach these situations with empathy and avoid judgement.","I don't experience stress or anxiety in the same way as other people I know. My feelings are intense, but not necessarily negative; it's more like a powerful current running through me.  While life's complexities can seem overwhelming at times, I tend to cope by seeking solace in nature or moments of quiet reflection.   The feeling I had at Mount Bonnell was a perfect example of how I resolve the intensity of the thoughts and feelings I have.",y,n,n,y,n
297,"I'm not really one for trying new things, I prefer sticking to what I know and what's comfortable for me.  I'm not particularly adventurous or interested in exploring new experiences; I value routine and familiarity.  Last night's sorority party was an exception, and it shows that even for me, a departure from my norm can happen.","I'm very goal-oriented and organized. I typically plan things out carefully and make sure I stay on track. For example, I made sure that I did all the prep work for my upcoming exams.  I prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and find strategies to stay focused and motivated. While sometimes I may feel overwhelmed, I always make sure to push through, to the end.","I enjoy social interaction, and a night out with friends is a great example. Last night at the sorority party, the initial lack of enjoyment turned into a fun night when I started interacting with a guy.  I thrive in these social situations, being around other people and sharing experiences, while maintaining my own level of privacy.","I generally try to be considerate of others' feelings, even when we disagree. In this situation, I feel awful for acting in a way that I felt was disrespectful and insensitive to him.  I value harmonious relationships and strive to resolve conflicts amicably, although this time, I failed to do so. It definitely brought to my attention the importance of careful decision-making, especially when under the influence of alcohol.","I generally don't experience high levels of stress or anxiety. I tend to approach situations calmly and rationally, even when things get tough. I know last night wasn't the best choice in terms of action, but the regret I feel afterwards is manageable.

When I have a goal, I create a detailed plan, break it down into manageable steps, and diligently track my progress.  I use reminders and to-do lists to stay on track and proactively address challenges as they arise. Achieving goals is rewarding, but the process can be demanding.",Social situations are usually draining. I value my alone time and find large gatherings or extended periods of socializing exhausting.  I prefer close relationships with a select few rather than superficial interactions with many people.  Spending too much time with others can leave me feeling depleted.,"I try to be considerate and understanding when resolving disagreements. I prioritize finding common ground and maintaining a positive relationship with the other person. I prefer collaboration to confrontation.  If a conflict is unavoidable, my goal is resolution while preserving mutual respect.","Stress and anxiety manifest as physical symptoms for me; my asthma flares up, and I get tired very easily. To manage it, I often need to withdraw and take some time for myself before approaching the situation. I prefer avoiding stressful scenarios as much as possible and rely on familiar comfort measures like spending time with my girlfriend.",n,y,n,y,n

While I might try a new restaurant occasionally, I’m not one for pushing myself outside my comfort zone in a big way.  The essay shows this is true, I'm excited to see a movie I've wanted to see for a while (GI Jane), but nothing particularly groundbreaking or experimental.","I’m pretty organized and planful.  Managing my time effectively is important to me; I make to-do lists and try to prioritize tasks. For example,  I'm clearly concerned about my upcoming finals in the essay, showing I'm aware of deadlines and the need for preparation. The essay shows concern over managing time to see her boyfriend and spend time with friends before he leaves. I find it rewarding to accomplish my goals and stay on track, even if it takes extra effort.","I enjoy spending time with people I'm close to, like my boyfriend and friends.  A memorable social experience was going out with them to see a movie.  Being around people I care about energizes me; having fun and making plans is important to me.  I definitely prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings over large, noisy crowds as demonstrated by my feelings about the large class size and the description of my enjoyable smaller group of friends.","I try to be considerate of others' feelings, even when disagreeing. I'll voice my opinions when necessary, but I usually prioritize maintaining positive relationships.  In the essay, my annoyance with others in the computer lab is expressed, but overall I prioritize positive interactions with my boyfriend, friends and focus on the fun aspects of my time with them. I find it easy to get along with people as long as they aren't too annoying.","I tend to be pretty relaxed and even-keeled. I don't usually get overly stressed or anxious, although there’s a bit of impatience expressed in the essay regarding the computer lab and her boyfriend.

However, the other day, I agreed to go to a clinic with my cousin for her immunization, even though I hate waking up early. Although it ultimately didn't go as planned (the clinic didn't offer immunizations), the experience itself wasn't inherently unpleasant, just inconvenient.  It wasn't something that deeply impacted me.","I don't really plan things out meticulously.  My approach to goals is more spontaneous and flexible. For example, I didn't have a structured plan for completing this assignment. I just started writing and went with the flow because I needed to keep myself awake.  While this isn't necessarily efficient, it works for me.  I find the lack of pressure less stressful.","Social interactions drain me, and meeting my friend for lunch is more of an obligation.  Large social gatherings especially tire me out quickly. I prefer more quiet activities and less social energy expenditure. I understand I am an introvert and need lots of alone time to recharge.","I tend to avoid confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I'll likely keep quiet or change the subject to keep the peace; I don't enjoy arguments. My priority is avoiding conflict, even if it means I don't directly address the disagreement.","Feeling tired and frustrated due to unexpected events (like the clinic visit) is pretty much my typical stress response. I didn't actively manage the negative feelings; I just accepted them and let them be, writing them down as I felt them. I'm not one to dwell on negative emotions.",y,n,n,n,n

I was motivated by a desire to try something completely different from my usual routine, something creative and hands-on.  It was surprisingly relaxing and satisfying; I discovered a hidden talent and even enjoyed the mess!","I'm very goal-oriented. For example, when I decided to improve my writing skills, I made a detailed plan with deadlines for specific goals.  I used various time management techniques, including breaking down larger tasks, to ensure I would stay consistent and motivated even during frustrating moments. I found the process both challenging and incredibly rewarding, and felt a great sense of accomplishment once I met my goals.","A recent social event, a large party with many people I didn't know, energized me.  The excitement and diverse conversations were stimulating.  I realized that while I can enjoy quiet time, I thrive in situations where I can connect with many individuals and be a part of the collective energy. Conversely, small, intimate gatherings can leave me drained,  I enjoy interaction but need to balance it with solitude to recharge.","I try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.  In a recent conflict, I listened carefully to the other person's perspective before explaining my position.  My priority was clear and respectful communication to find a compromise, even if it meant adjusting my own viewpoint somewhat.","I often experience periods of stress and anxiety, sometimes triggered by seemingly insignificant events,  as exemplified in my essay by my odd cold feeling and recurring nightmares.

I found the process surprisingly relaxing and rewarding, although I still have a lot to learn!","I'm currently working towards completing my degree.  To stay on track, I use a planner and create detailed schedules to manage my time effectively. I prioritize tasks and break down large assignments into smaller, more manageable goals. When challenges arise (like unexpected setbacks or procrastination), I remind myself of my long-term objectives, re-prioritize if needed, and seek help when I’m struggling. The most rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment with each milestone reached.","I generally prefer smaller, more intimate social gatherings over large, loud events.  For instance, catching up with a close friend over coffee is incredibly energizing, fostering a sense of connection and comfort. On the other hand, crowded parties or forced interactions can be draining and leave me feeling depleted. These experiences reinforce my preference for close relationships over superficial interactions.","Disagreements arise, of course.  I usually prioritize understanding the other person’s perspective before stating my own.  I try to be calm, listen attentively, and find common ground. My goal isn't necessarily to win an argument, but to resolve the conflict in a way that feels respectful and fair to everyone involved.","Sometimes, the pressure of deadlines and life's uncertainties leads to stress.  My initial response might be a slight sense of overwhelm, but I've learned to manage it by engaging in relaxing activities like watching TV (it’s a great escape!), or focusing on tasks one at a time.

I feel a little embarrassed that it took me so long, but I'm determined to do well.","Balancing my studies and personal life is a constant juggling act. I’m very organized and dedicated, so I use planners and to-do lists to keep on track. My husband supports me, as does my husband's professor, which helps keep me committed.  The hardest part is maintaining work-life balance, but the reward is knowing I'm pursuing a career I truly want.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining for me.  I thrive in smaller, intimate gatherings with close friends and family, like when I used to help my dad at fire prevention fairs. However, larger, more boisterous events can leave me feeling overwhelmed and needing quiet time to recharge.  I’ve learned I need a good balance to stay happy.","I generally try to be agreeable, but I've had disagreements with those who dismiss Princess Diana's importance.  I approach these conversations by calmly explaining my perspective, emphasizing her positive impact on others. I prioritize respectful dialogue, even if we don't reach complete agreement, because it's important to me that they understand my appreciation for her.","The death of Princess Diana has been incredibly upsetting, causing significant anxiety and stress.

304,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  The essay shows I've traveled to Germany and that was amazing, but it wasn't something I consciously chose for the sake of novelty.  My experiences tend to come to me more than I actively seek them out.  I value comfort and familiarity, so stepping outside my usual routine is less of a priority for me.","I'm not the most organized person. The essay highlights my struggles with setting up my computer and the frustration it caused. While I want to achieve goals like looking good for Thanksgiving or having a good time in college, my approach is more reactive than proactive, and my follow through isn't always consistent.   I'm more focused on the feeling of achieving something than meticulously planning every step.","The essay doesn't depict me as a highly social person. While I enjoyed my time in Germany with the Meyers, the fact that I miss them and my dog suggests I draw a lot of energy from close relationships rather than large groups.  I mention feeling drained by the lack of communication from Joe, illustrating that social interactions, even if close, need to happen on my terms to be positive.","I generally strive to be agreeable; the essay shows my desire to be liked and accepted by my friends. When there’s conflict, such as my frustration with Joe, I usually avoid open confrontation and instead focus on my own feelings. However, I don’t seem to actively seek conflict resolution.  My priority is maintaining harmony and positive relationships, even if it means suppressing my own concerns.","I get stressed and anxious, as clearly shown throughout the essay.  Worries about weight gain, missing phone calls, and loneliness appear.

My boyfriend, Mohamed, is probably the biggest thing outside my comfort zone I've ever encountered, and even that was more of a gradual, surprising development than a planned adventure.  I'm pretty comfortable in my routine, to be honest.","I'm definitely not the most organized person.  My schoolwork is a prime example – I'm already behind in the first few weeks!  I haven't really developed any effective time management strategies, mostly because I haven't really tried.  I guess I find the thought of actually putting in the effort to stay on track more challenging than just doing things last minute.","Spending time with Mohamed is always energizing.  He's fascinating, and our conversations are stimulating.  I think the shared laughter and connection are what make it so fulfilling. On the other hand, I get pretty drained from interactions where I feel pressured to be someone I'm not, like when I'm around Asian guys I might date.  I prefer smaller, intimate gatherings over large, crowded social settings.","I try to be agreeable, and generally I am. Disagreements, however, are tricky.  If I feel strongly about something, I can be quite stubborn and prefer to have things my way.  With my boyfriend, though, I try to find common ground and be understanding, especially because he's very different from me culturally.","I get anxious really easily, especially when I'm worried about my relationship with Mohamed, or when I'm behind on schoolwork.

I know I should be more proactive but I haven't really worked out any healthy ways of dealing with anxiety.",n,n,y,y,y

I tend to focus on immediate tasks and the present moment, enjoying the flow of completing things in a timely manner. If faced with a longer-term goal, I would likely break it down into smaller, more manageable parts to achieve success.

What motivated me was a desire to improve my self-discipline and mental fortitude; I see the brain as a muscle that needs regular exercise.  I've found the experience rewarding in terms of physical fitness, but also intriguing from a mental perspective, seeing it as a conversation between body and mind.","My goal of getting back into running required consistent effort and time management. I've been trying to schedule runs regularly, even if it means sacrificing other activities, and I find that setting realistic, achievable goals is key to staying committed. It's been challenging to overcome periods of fatigue and the initial lack of motivation, but rewarding to see gradual improvement and increased self-discipline.","Honestly, most social situations leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends to large, boisterous parties. The essay reflects this preference - I mention enjoying a movie with ""my home crowd,"" a small, familiar group,  while expressing a lack of desire for a girlfriend at this time.  The interaction with the ""pretty girl"" in my psych class, however, shows my preference for one-on-one interactions as opposed to large social settings.","I try to handle disagreements calmly and rationally, focusing on finding common ground and understanding the other person's perspective.

The goal of becoming freshman representative required some effort, but my approach wasn't meticulously planned.

It reinforces my preference for social interactions within the familiar settings I've already established.","My French horn teacher is a jerk, and I'm not afraid to say it.  I handle disagreements by internalizing them. While I respect his musical talent, his behavior is unacceptable.  I don't engage in confrontations.

Balancing school, pledging, and studying feels overwhelming, leaving little time for anything else. I don’t have any specific strategies for managing my time.  I just try to get things done, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.  The constant pressure to keep up is definitely a challenge.","Large social gatherings drain me.

Although not exceptionally exciting, the experience allowed me to form my own opinion, independent of what others thought. I found it interesting to analyze the event as a form of propaganda, a perspective I wouldn't have considered before.","While I didn't explicitly set a time-based goal in the essay, the act of writing itself for a sustained twenty minutes reflects a degree of commitment to the task.  I didn't employ specific time management techniques, but the internal drive to reach the self-imposed twenty-minute mark reflects discipline in a less structured sense. It was both rewarding (a creative outlet) and challenging (keeping my mind focused and my thoughts flowing).","The MTV awards show was a surprisingly draining social experience. While surrounded by people, I felt a disconnect from the shared enthusiasm, leaving me feeling somewhat isolated in my own thoughts and observations. This reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions, or even solitude where I can process my thoughts without feeling pressured to participate in group energy.","While the essay doesn't detail any explicit disagreements, the critical tone towards Michael Jackson and other celebrities reflects a willingness to voice dissent, even if indirectly. My priority would likely be expressing my thoughts honestly, even if it might not align perfectly with popular opinion.  I wouldn't likely pursue confrontation but would express my views independently.","The essay doesn't explicitly detail any moments of extreme stress or anxiety, but the stream-of-consciousness style might suggest a tendency to dwell on fleeting thoughts and observations.  My initial response to any stressor would likely involve internal processing and reflection, rather than outward displays of anxiety. I would likely attempt to manage my emotions by engaging in activities I enjoy, like listening to music or perhaps writing.",y,y,y,y,n
312,"I haven't really sought out many novel experiences.  While I've considered playing tennis, the essay shows I'm more focused on managing my current workload and responsibilities.  New things aren't a priority right now; my energy is directed toward familiar, comfortable activities.","I thrive on structure and planning. The essay demonstrates my dedication to organizing my academic schedule and staying ahead of assignments.  I proactively manage my time to avoid last-minute stress, leveraging the knowledge of upcoming deadlines to create a manageable workload.  The challenge is maintaining this level of organization amidst the distractions of college life. The reward is a sense of control and accomplishment.","A recent call with a close friend, Jeff, was incredibly energizing. The connection, after a long period of separation, recharged me.  Conversely, the noise from my dorm neighbors is draining; it disrupts my focus and studying.  I seem to prefer deep connections over large social gatherings, needing time alone to recharge after interacting with others.","I generally try to be agreeable and avoid conflict. However, the dorm noise situation highlights a potential conflict point. My response is to complain to the dorm staff, prioritizing a peaceful study environment. Although I haven't detailed how I approach disagreements with individuals directly, I try to resolve issues indirectly, or by appealing to authority.","The essay reveals my tendency toward anxiety. The late nights, academic pressure, and dorm disruptions all contribute to stress. I handle this through various coping mechanisms: complaining, planning, focusing on structure, and using humor in my writing.  While I feel stressed and anxious at times, I actively attempt to manage my emotions rather than avoiding them.",n,y,y,y,y
313,"Trying out for the crew team was a completely new experience for me.  I'd never done anything like it before, and the intense competition motivated me to push my physical and mental limits. Although the pressure was immense, the experience ultimately left me feeling proud of my effort and more confident in my ability to handle challenges.","Getting into law school is a long-term goal requiring meticulous planning and dedication.  To stay on track, I meticulously manage my time, creating detailed schedules and prioritizing tasks.  Even when setbacks like rejection from business school occur, I utilize coping mechanisms to refocus and maintain my commitment. The challenges are significant, but the reward of pursuing my ambition is a powerful motivator.","My first day of crew tryouts was an incredibly energizing social experience.  Surrounded by driven and like-minded individuals with a shared passion, I felt a sense of belonging and excitement. This positive interaction reaffirmed my preference for engaging in collaborative activities with people who share similar goals, reinforcing the importance of shared experiences for my well-being.","The conflict with my boyfriend highlighted the difficulties in balancing my needs with his. While our disagreement stemmed from stress and different priorities regarding intimacy, I prioritized open communication and understanding. My goal was to resolve the issue through compromise and empathy, even if it meant addressing my own contribution to the conflict.","Rejection from business school initially triggered intense anger and frustration. However, I channeled these negative emotions into constructive action, focusing on my pre-law studies and seeking support from my brother.  While anxiety and stress linger, I use writing and self-reflection to process my feelings and prevent them from overwhelming me.",y,y,y,y,y
314,"I'm always looking for new experiences.  For instance, I recently started learning about different music genres I normally wouldn't listen to, driven by a desire to broaden my horizons and challenge my musical preferences. I found it surprisingly enjoyable, discovering some artists I really connected with.  It definitely expanded my appreciation for music's diversity.","I've been working towards getting into medical school, which requires a significant amount of effort and planning. I create detailed to-do lists and allocate specific times for studying each subject, though sometimes I procrastinate until the last minute! I use rewards as motivation, like letting myself listen to music after completing a section of studying. The most challenging part is maintaining focus and avoiding distractions, but the reward of reaching my goal makes it worthwhile.","A recent concert with friends was incredibly energizing. The shared excitement, singing along, and the overall atmosphere created a positive and fulfilling experience. It reaffirmed my enjoyment of social interaction and collaborative experiences, confirming my preference for outgoing social activities.  Conversely, I have to actively avoid events that I feel will drain my energy.","I try to be understanding, even when I disagree with someone's opinion. In a recent discussion about music preferences, I actively listened to their reasons and voiced my own viewpoint respectfully. I prioritized finding common ground and mutual understanding rather than winning the argument.  Ultimately, we agreed to disagree amicably.","I handle stress by listening to music and procrastinating, which isn't always effective! While I sometimes panic when I leave things until the last minute, I generally approach stressful situations with humor and a self-deprecating attitude, reminding myself that I can handle whatever comes my way. I also try to break things down into smaller tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.",y,y,y,y,n
315,"I've always been curious about new things, even if they scare me a little.  Taking an improv class a few years ago was a huge step outside my comfort zone.  I was motivated by a desire to overcome my shyness and maybe even be a bit more spontaneous. Though I felt awkward at first, it was ultimately a rewarding experience that helped me to loosen up and appreciate the absurdity of life.","I'm pretty organized when it comes to achieving my goals, which is probably why I tend to overthink things.  For my last big project—finishing my degree—I created a detailed timeline, broke down assignments into smaller chunks, and used a planner religiously. I found rewarding the sense of accomplishment that came from meeting my deadlines, even if the experience itself was often stressful.","Social situations can be draining for me; I'm not the life of the party, that's for sure.  A small gathering with close friends is much more energizing than a large, noisy party.  I realized that smaller, more intimate gatherings allow me to be myself without feeling the need to put on a show, which lessens the social anxiety that often accompanies larger groups.","I tend to avoid conflict, but sometimes disagreements are unavoidable. If I find myself at odds with someone, I try to listen to their perspective and express my own calmly, aiming for a mutual understanding. My priority is to keep communication respectful, even if we don't always agree on the solution. If all else fails, I often just remove myself from the situation for a while to decompress before engaging again.","I'm prone to anxiety, especially when facing big decisions, like the dance team tryouts, which is why I find it so difficult to make even small decisions.  When stress hits, my initial reaction is to overthink and worry.  To manage this, I try to break down the issue into smaller parts, practice mindfulness and self-soothing techniques, and seek support from those I trust.  I find that talking things through helps to gain perspective and reduce feelings of overwhelm.",y,y,n,n,y
316,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I'm pretty comfortable with my routine and familiar surroundings. The essay reflects this, showing my focus on my current concerns and relationships rather than exploring anything unfamiliar.","I don't have a strong track record of setting and achieving long-term goals. The essay reveals my preoccupation with immediate worries and anxieties, leaving little room for focused planning and sustained effort toward larger objectives.  I tend to react to things as they come up rather than proactively planning.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained rather than energized. The essay reflects this in my descriptions of feeling overwhelmed by my relationships and a desire for solitude. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings to large social gatherings.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation. While I care about others' feelings, as the essay shows, I often struggle to express my own needs or disagree openly. I prioritize maintaining harmony, sometimes even at the expense of my own comfort.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My essay shows this through my constant stream-of-consciousness worrying about relationships, academics, and various other things. I don't have many constructive coping mechanisms but rather focus on my worries.",n,n,n,n,n
317,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Trying new things often feels overwhelming and makes me anxious. I'd much rather stick to what I know and what's comfortable, which usually involves relaxing at home or spending time with close friends.","Planning and sticking to goals isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to be more spontaneous and go with the flow. If I have a deadline, I might get it done, but it's unlikely to be on time or perfectly executed.  I don't really think strategically about how I'll manage my time; I just sort of wing it.","I love spending time with my friends, especially when we're having a good time and the energy is high. I love to laugh, have some drinks, and just relax with my close friends. It energizes me. Large, crowded social situations, however, can drain me pretty quickly.  I need time to recharge after social events, even the good ones, because I don't like the intense feeling of being around a lot of people.","I definitely don't shy away from conflict. If I disagree with someone, I’ll voice my opinion, even if it makes things a little uncomfortable. It's more important to me to be honest about how I feel than to keep the peace all the time. Sometimes I have difficulty compromising and prioritizing relationships.","I get stressed easily. I've had a lot of things happening lately, a car accident, some financial worries, and I'm just feeling down.  My immediate reaction to stress is often feeling anxious and overwhelmed. When it happens, I tend to go out and drink to cope. This might help alleviate the immediate stress, but makes it worse in the long run.",n,n,y,n,y
318,"I've always been drawn to intense, visceral music, and death metal specifically has always resonated with me.  Discovering this genre was a huge shift in my musical tastes; I went from listening to whatever was on the radio to actively seeking out complex and aggressive sounds. It expanded my appreciation for musical expression beyond what I initially thought I liked, and now I actively seek out new and challenging artists and sounds.","Honestly, I haven't been the most goal-oriented person.  I started playing drums, got good, then stopped.  My friend's success motivates me, but I haven't actively pursued similar goals myself.  I tend to drift with what interests me, even if it means abandoning things mid-way through.  Perhaps there is something there I could learn from.","Social situations, especially large ones, tend to drain me.  I'm much happier alone, listening to music or reflecting on things.  Even seeing my friend off to Maryland felt overwhelmingly emotional, and I prefer a quieter life than having a wide social circle. I find a lot of stimulation from my alone time and that's where I find my energy.  It's not that I dislike people, but large social settings feel intensely uncomfortable.","I find myself frustrated when people dismiss death metal without understanding it. Their negative opinions often stem from ignorance, and I will fiercely defend the genre and the skill it takes to play, despite my own lack of current skill.  It is more about upholding what I believe to be true rather than a need for agreement. I feel protective of something I enjoy.","The thought of my friend moving so far away and having to leave his family and friends causes me a great deal of anxiety.  My initial reaction is a sort of sadness and a feeling of helplessness. To cope, I listen to music and try to distract myself; I really hope things work out for him. The distance and uncertainty are hard to manage.",y,n,n,n,y
319,"I've always been drawn to unconventional experiences.  For example,  I recently decided to learn how to play the electric guitar, something completely outside my usual routine. I was motivated by a desire for a creative outlet and a challenge, something different from my usual habits. While I’m still learning, the process itself has been incredibly fulfilling;  it's a way to express myself and channel my energy.","I don't really believe in long-term goals. I'm more of a ""go with the flow"" kind of person. I tend to make things up as I go along and honestly, I probably wouldn't stick to some rigid plan, so the idea of having a goal which needs sustained effort and planning is quite a challenging one. The idea itself seems quite boring, especially given my lack of planning skills.","Large social gatherings are typically energizing for me. The buzz of a lively party,  lots of loud music and interesting people—that’s where I feel most comfortable and alive.  Conversely, small, quiet gatherings or one-on-one interactions can leave me feeling depleted.  It taught me that my need for social energy is satisfied in large and loud groups.","Disagreements are something I often avoid, and this usually manifests itself as a complete shut down rather than actively engaging in the confrontation. If I do get into an argument or disagreement, I tend to just keep my own counsel. I will let the other person win just to avoid any further drama or conflict because, let's be honest, confrontation isn't my forte.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  My initial response is usually internal and manifests itself through my choice of music. The fast-paced and intense music helps me to externalize my feelings, and it's how I deal with feeling overwhelmed.  I’ve learned that finding a way to process and release those feelings—whether through music, ignoring them, or drinking—is essential to coping constructively.",y,n,y,n,n
320,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and recently that led me to take informal classes in something completely outside my usual comfort zone.  The motivation stemmed from a desire for personal growth and a curiosity about new skills. Though I haven’t completed the classes yet, I'm finding the experience stimulating and enriching, if a bit overwhelming at times.","Balancing my academic workload with other commitments has been a significant goal requiring sustained effort. I've tried to utilize to-do lists and scheduling to stay organized.  While I sometimes struggle to maintain this level of organization, and miss commitments like club meetings, I find satisfaction in achieving my academic goals, even if it sometimes comes at the expense of other things.","Social interactions tend to drain me rather than energize me.  The essay reflects this preference; a large party isn't appealing, for instance. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, where I can engage in meaningful conversations rather than large, stimulating events. This understanding has helped me prioritize these smaller and more personal connections.","Disagreements are usually navigated with careful consideration of the other person's perspective. My priority is mutual understanding and finding a resolution that respects everyone's feelings.  I believe in open communication and compromise. While not always successful, the goal is always to maintain a positive relationship.","Stress and anxiety manifest as procrastination and self-doubt. My initial response to pressure is sometimes avoidance, a tendency that my essay shows.

The motivation was purely practical, as I needed to access the university website and complete assignments. Afterwards, I felt relieved to have accomplished something, but not exactly excited about the experience itself.","I set a goal to complete this essay assignment, even though the deadline is far off and I found the whole process quite difficult. I haven't really managed my time well, I waited until the last minute, and only started because I was made to. There wasn't much strategy involved other than just sitting down and starting; the most rewarding part is simply that it's done.","Social interactions are often draining for me. I much prefer communicating with my boyfriend over the phone than interacting with others in person. I think this is because large social gatherings are overwhelming and stressful for me, I feel I cannot be myself or relax without having that one special person with me. It reinforces my preference for close, intimate relationships over large groups of people.","I tend to avoid disagreements.  If I find myself in conflict, I usually try to simply accommodate the other person's perspective to avoid conflict, even if I disagree.  My priority is to maintain peace, even if it means sacrificing my own point of view.","When I feel stressed or anxious, I call my boyfriend. Talking to him instantly makes me feel better, and he helps me calm down. I tend to avoid dealing with problems on my own and rely heavily on his support.  It's a coping mechanism that works for me, even if it can sometimes lead to issues with my phone bill.",n,n,n,n,y

I utilized strategies like setting deadlines for each section and regularly checking my progress.  While I struggled with procrastination at times and found it mentally exhausting, the feeling of accomplishment upon completion was extremely rewarding.","Going out with friends to a concert was incredibly energizing, because the upbeat atmosphere and shared experience created a positive energy that boosted my mood.  In contrast, a quiet evening alone, while it could be pleasant, didn't provide the same level of excitement or social connection.","There was a disagreement with my roommates about household chores.  I approached it by calmly explaining my perspective, listening to theirs, and trying to find a compromise that worked for everyone.

However, I did recently try Chinese food for the first time, which was... an experience. It wasn't something I was particularly motivated to do, it was more of a ""let's see what happens"" kind of thing.  Afterwards, I felt a little nauseous, which likely impacted my overall opinion.",Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to be more spontaneous. The idea of meticulously planning and managing my time to reach a goal feels like a lot of work. I often find myself distracted or losing motivation before I can really make progress on things that require sustained effort. I'd rather do things that interest me in the moment.,"Being around my friends watching a football game is usually energizing. The shared experience and lively conversation are what makes it fun.  I can easily get drained in larger social settings or by people who are too serious or negative. I need people who are easy-going and fun to hang out with, and a setting where I feel relaxed and comfortable.","I try to avoid conflict whenever possible. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just go along with it, unless it's something really important to me.  My priority is maintaining a positive relationship, even if it means compromising my own opinions.

324,"I'm definitely open to new experiences, though I don't always actively seek them out.  Reading ""Vurt"" by Jeff Noon was a huge leap outside my comfort zone; I rarely dive into entirely new genres.  The experience was exhilarating; it opened my mind to different narrative styles and perspectives and gave me a new favorite author. I'm now more inclined to explore other books outside my usual preferences.","I'm not particularly organized or goal-oriented. I procrastinated on my high school computer class until it was the only option left.  While I did manage to finish my programming class and learned something from it, I didn't actively plan or manage my time to complete the project efficiently. My motivation is more driven by avoiding undesirable consequences or fulfilling immediate curiosity than by a structured approach to completing tasks.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.  The essay reflects my difficulty engaging in prolonged conversations with strangers, preferring solitary activities. The example in the essay is of my awkwardness in initiating conversation with someone, despite wanting to connect. My ideal social setting involves small groups and people I know, avoiding large, loud gatherings.  I deeply value the quieter moments and avoid pushing myself into situations that leave me feeling exhausted.","Disagreements tend to make me uncomfortable.  I don't directly address conflict, but rather withdraw or avoid the situation. The essay highlights my tendency to keep my opinions to myself.   My priority in conflict resolution is to preserve harmony, which may mean avoiding confrontation at the cost of voicing my concerns.","I experience high levels of anxiety and stress easily. As the essay mentions, writing something as free-flowing as this makes me feel anxious. I tend to overthink, resulting in feelings of self-doubt and apprehension.  My coping mechanisms are mostly passive – avoiding situations that trigger stress, and retreating into my thoughts or other activities. I'm quick to self-criticize and worry.",y,n,n,n,y
325,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying completely new things. I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable for me.

I'd always been shy, but the idea of completely abandoning my carefully crafted persona appealed to me, plus my friends were doing it and convinced me to join.

I used a planner and broke down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks.  When I felt overwhelmed, I reminded myself of my long-term goal and prioritized tasks accordingly.  It was challenging to stay focused amidst distractions, but the sense of accomplishment at each milestone—and finally graduation—was hugely rewarding.","A memorable social experience was attending a large, energetic concert. The sheer vibrancy of the crowd, everyone’s shared enthusiasm for the music, and the effortless connections made me feel incredibly alive and energized.

It was an experiment in self-expression, a departure from the usual routine.","Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my strong suit.  The essay shows I'm aware of my procrastination, yet I don't really have strategies to overcome it.

My inclination is towards avoiding confrontation and withdrawing from situations that create tension, instead of attempting to resolve the conflict in an assertive way.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  The essay clearly shows this, reflecting the frustrations I experience with my lack of productivity and the resulting sleep deprivation.

My priority is usually to find common ground and maintain a positive relationship; a fight is rarely worth it.","I don't generally get stressed or anxious.  Even the pressure of applying to the FBI is more exciting than truly stressful. If I feel overwhelmed, I usually just take a break and try to refocus my energy. I believe things work themselves out, so I don't get too caught up in worrying.",n,y,y,y,n
333,"I've always been drawn to new experiences. Taking this psychology course was a perfect example; I'd never studied the subject in-depth before, but the lectures fascinated me.  I found the concepts incredibly intriguing and I left each class feeling stimulated and excited to learn more. It’s fueled my curiosity about the human mind and its complexities.","Preparing for the MCAT this spring is a huge goal that demands consistent effort. I've tried to create a study schedule, allocating specific times for each subject, but honestly, I've struggled to stick to it perfectly.  The sheer volume of material is daunting, and staying motivated has been a challenge.  However, I'm trying to find ways to reward myself for progress and focus on consistent effort rather than perfection.","Spending time with my old roommate, even if it’s just thinking about her, usually energizes me. She's an interesting person who always has something new to share. I find her perspective uplifting and our conversations fill me with positive energy. Being around positive people helps me feel more social and connected.","I generally strive for harmony in my interactions with others.  But I do disagree with my friend's decision to join the Corps because of what I've heard. I worry about her wellbeing given the demanding nature of this organization. However,  I’m respecting her choice, expressing my concerns respectfully without trying to change her mind, focusing on understanding her perspective.","The looming MCAT has been a significant source of stress and anxiety. I initially felt overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task, which triggered worry and nervousness. To cope, I’ve been trying to break down the preparation into smaller, more manageable tasks, and remind myself to focus on what I can control. Trying to focus on the positives of this process helps distract me from the worries.",y,y,y,y,n
334,"I’ve always been curious about new experiences, and that's why I'm so excited for the Rage Against the Machine concert!  It's something completely outside my normal routine, and the energy of the crowd is something I'm looking forward to. I’m eager to see how it feels to be surrounded by such a large, passionate group of people. Afterward, I expect I'll feel invigorated and perhaps even a little rebellious.","Becoming a plastic and reconstructive surgeon requires intense dedication.  To achieve this, I need to maintain a high GPA, which demands careful time management and prioritizing my studies.  I plan my study sessions meticulously, breaking down larger tasks into manageable chunks to remain focused and organized. It's challenging, but the reward of helping people and achieving my career aspirations keeps me motivated.","While I enjoy being around my close friends and family (like at the concert!), large, overly stimulating social situations can feel overwhelming.  The Rage Against the Machine concert, however, is different.  It’s less about casual interaction and more about sharing a collective experience fueled by our common interest in the band. This aligns with my social preferences more than a general social gathering would.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, but I handle them directly. I'd express my opinion calmly and clearly, prioritizing understanding the other person's perspective rather than winning the argument.  However, if compromise isn't possible, I would politely disengage rather than engage in a prolonged conflict.  Maintaining respectful communication is key for me.","I generally don't experience significant stress or anxiety. Even when faced with challenges, like the traffic mentioned earlier, I handle them with a practical, relatively calm demeanor. I find a way to shift focus to something positive, like imagining what it would be like to just fly above the traffic! My emotional response is typically mild and easily manageable.",y,y,n,n,n
335,I wouldn't say I'm one for trying completely new things.  I'm pretty comfortable with my routine and familiar activities.  The essay probably reflects that. I stick with what I know.,"I'm definitely a planner.  Balancing school, my social life, and maintaining my relationship with my ex requires a lot of organization. I use calendars and to-do lists to stay on track and prioritize tasks.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, but I generally manage to stay focused on my goals.",Seeing my ex-boyfriend this weekend is definitely an energizing social experience.  I love spending time with him;  our interactions are always fun and exciting. Even being apart makes me excited and energized about the prospect of being together. Being around people I connect with gives me a lot of energy.,"I tend to be agreeable and avoid conflict, but disagreements are inevitable, especially with a stubborn ex-boyfriend!  I usually try to understand their perspective and find a compromise. If it is unavoidable, I will try to communicate my feelings clearly and calmly, hoping for a mutual understanding.","I don't tend to get overly stressed or anxious. The essay might seem to contradict this, but I handle stressful situations with a positive outlook. I know I can get through anything with a plan. Even the uncertainty about my relationship doesn't make me overly stressed, I just take things as they come.",n,y,y,y,n
336,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, even if it means stepping outside of my comfort zone.  The survey on homosexuality in class was a good example. Although my answers were strongly biased because of my own identity and experiences, engaging with that survey and expressing my beliefs was a new kind of exploration for me. It felt both exhilarating and nerve-wracking, ultimately leaving me with a sense of self-affirmation and a greater understanding of myself.","I don't necessarily approach goals with meticulous planning.  Things often happen more spontaneously. While I'm determined in certain aspects, sustained effort towards long-term goals isn't always my strong suit.  For example, my plans for the weekend are pretty loose – a night out at Paradox with friends and maybe meeting some new people. I'm not particularly concerned with a strict schedule and prefer things to unfold naturally.","A memorable social experience was engaging with the class survey on homosexuality. Sharing my opinions and beliefs with others, even if it involved some anxiety, was energizing.  The affirmation I felt from others who shared similar viewpoints was deeply satisfying. However, overly structured social situations or interactions with people who dismiss my opinions can easily drain my energy.","Disagreements are inevitable, and I tend to handle them directly, but not always agreeably.  My priorities are to clearly express my position and feelings. While I'm not known for compromising easily, I try to state my viewpoint rationally without resorting to personal attacks. That said, my strong beliefs can lead to conflict if others aren't receptive to what I have to say.","I often experience stress and anxiety, especially regarding my personal life.  Initially, my response is a surge of intense emotion, often manifesting as a desire to escape or avoid the situation.  To manage it, I use distractions, like writing, or seek comfort in friends.  Sometimes, the stress just accumulates until I need a drastic change, like escaping to someplace new or different.",y,n,y,n,y
337,"I've always been drawn to things outside my usual comfort zone.  Listening to the El-Hazard soundtrack, a completely new experience for me, was captivating. The complex musical arrangements and emotional depth really grabbed my attention. Afterward, I felt invigorated and curious to explore more of the anime's world, and its music, which motivated me to download the songs I enjoyed.","I don’t really plan things out much. I tend to get sidetracked and focus more on what interests me in the moment than my goals, like writing this essay.  If there's something I truly want to experience, like watching the rest of the El-Hazard series, I'll find a way to make time for it, but I rarely proactively manage my time or resources for broader goals.","Social situations aren't really my thing.  I'd much rather spend my time engrossed in something that captivates me, like El-Hazard, than engaging in extended social interactions.  Overwhelming social settings drain my energy; I prefer quiet moments of contemplation and enjoyment.","I strive to understand different perspectives, even if I don't necessarily agree with them. When there's conflict, my priority is understanding and appreciating another’s viewpoint. I’d rather find common ground than win an argument.  My preference for quiet contemplation influences my approach to resolving conflict.","I don't get stressed or anxious easily.  I generally approach situations calmly, and if I am feeling overwhelmed, I find solace in immersing myself in the things I enjoy, like El-hazard, which calms and centers me.

Recently, I started attending church again after a long absence, motivated by a desire for a sense of community and spiritual grounding. While the experience was initially a bit unsettling, it ultimately left me feeling more peaceful and connected.","Maintaining a consistent journaling practice has been a goal of mine.  To stay on track, I schedule specific times for writing, even if it's just for a few minutes. I prioritize this activity because it serves as a valuable stress reliever. While life gets busy, making it a habit has proven rewarding in managing my emotional well-being.",A recent social interaction with my ex-boyfriend left me feeling quite drained. The ambiguity of his intentions and the emotional baggage involved were exhausting. This experience reinforced my need for clear boundaries in relationships and to prioritize interactions that leave me feeling uplifted rather than depleted.,"I have disagreements frequently, but often choose to avoid conflict, particularly with people I value. In the case of my ex-boyfriend, I'm prioritizing avoiding further conflict because of the emotional toll. However, this strategy comes at the cost of clear communication which might ultimately be more helpful in the long run.","When I'm stressed, my initial reaction is often to withdraw and overthink.  To manage this, I’ve found journaling to be a helpful coping mechanism and helps to process my emotions.  While I still experience anxiety, I'm learning to navigate these feelings constructively through self-reflection and writing.",y,y,y,n,y
339,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and recently I decided to try horseback riding.  The essay shows my desire for freedom and a connection with nature, which the idea of galloping through a field fulfilled. Afterward, I felt exhilarated and empowered, a feeling that resonated deeply with my desire for personal growth and overcoming limitations.","My essay reveals a lack of structure in my life; I struggle with goal-setting and following through.  I have many aspirations – more knowledge, a stable home, etc. – yet I often lack the consistent effort to achieve them.  This is reflected in my scattered thoughts and conflicting desires throughout the writing.  While I value the things I want, the effort needed to attain them remains a challenge.","The essay demonstrates my extraverted nature through my desire for connection and social interaction.  Engaging in conversations with others, whether stable or unstable individuals, energizes me, as shown in my writing. Conversely, solitude, while sometimes appealing, eventually leaves me yearning for connection and companionship.  I crave being celebrated, praised, and loved.","Despite my agreeable nature, as evidenced in my empathy for others and my reluctance to hurt them, I struggle to be assertive. My essay demonstrates a conflict between my desire for connection and my tendency to avoid confrontation, which explains my inability to address the pursuit by the man with a girlfriend. The fear of hurting others holds me back.","While the essay reflects anxieties about relationships, instability, and the future, it also highlights my ability to cope.  My reaction to stress is introspective, expressed through self-reflection and journaling.  Although the fear of being alone is prominent, I manage my emotions through creative outlets and a search for spiritual grounding, suggesting a healthy capacity to process and handle my emotional responses.",y,n,y,y,n
340,I don't really seek out new experiences or different ways of thinking.  I'm pretty content with what I know and what's familiar.  The essay shows my focus is elsewhere; I'm more interested in what's immediately around me and my own thoughts than exploring uncharted territory.  Trying something completely new just doesn't really appeal to me.,"I'm not particularly organized or focused on long-term goals. This essay itself demonstrates that; I'm easily distracted and let my mind wander.  My thoughts jump from one thing to the next.  I don't really think about time management. If I'm supposed to be working on something, then I do it, but I get easily sidetracked.  Rewarding? Getting it done in a pinch I guess.","I enjoy being around people, especially attractive ones.  The essay reveals how much I'm engaging with my surroundings; I notice everything.  Social interactions energize me, I think, but I do get frustrated when those interactions are not what I want.  For example, I get annoyed when my expectations of others (like the lab assistant) are not met.","I tend to be more concerned with my own feelings and thoughts than those of others. Disagreements are something to be avoided, I think.  I'm not one to seek conflict.  If I'm in a disagreement with someone, I would just avoid it; it's not worth the effort or hassle to resolve something.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My thoughts jump around, my focus is poor.  I don't have any constructive strategies for managing these feelings.  The essay itself shows a mind that's jumping around and focused on a thousand things all at once.  I tend to just let the anxiety happen and continue with what I'm doing.",n,n,y,n,y
341,"I decided to take an improv class.  I'd always been shy and hesitant to be spontaneous, but I felt it was crucial to step outside my comfort zone and embrace the unknown. I was surprised by how much fun I had; it helped me let go and express myself in unexpected ways, improving my confidence and creativity.","My goal was to maintain a 3.8 GPA throughout college. I used a planner to manage my time, prioritizing assignments, and dedicating specific time blocks for studying and extracurricular activities.  Staying disciplined wasn't always easy, especially balancing social life and academics.  The reward of academic success and feeling in control motivated me to maintain my schedule.","A recent gathering with friends at a karaoke bar was incredibly energizing.  The casual, fun atmosphere, coupled with shared laughter and singing, helped me connect with others. This reminded me of my need for social interaction and how being around positive and supportive friends boosts my energy levels.","In a group project, my groupmates' approach clashed with my organizational preferences. I was frustrated, but rather than confront them immediately, I focused on finding common ground. I emphasized the shared goal and proposed a compromise to incorporate elements from both approaches to find a solution that worked for everyone, or as close to it as possible.","During exam season, anxiety and stress began to increase. To manage this, I implemented a healthy routine including regular exercise, mindfulness practices and prioritized sleep. This helped in regulating my emotional responses and approaching my studies with a clearer, less anxious mind.",y,y,y,n,n
342,"I don't often seek out new experiences.  The essay reflects a focus on my immediate concerns and relationships, rather than a desire for novelty or exploration.  Trying new things isn't a high priority for me; I prefer familiarity and routine.","I'm quite organized and dedicated to completing tasks.  While the essay shows some procrastination (like the Economics question),  the overall stream of consciousness reveals a person focused on managing various aspects of their life – relationships, diet, and academic responsibilities – indicating a high level of conscientiousness despite occasional lapses.  My ability to set and follow through on goals, like the weight loss, is a testament to this.","I don't get much energy from social interactions. The essay highlights anxieties about social situations, feeling overwhelmed by others' behavior and a general preference for solitude or smaller interactions, suggesting introversion rather than extraversion.  Large social gatherings or interactions with people I don't know are draining to me.","I'm not always easygoing or accommodating. The essay shows a critical and judgmental tone towards others, expressing negative opinions about people in her life without prioritizing diplomacy or compromise, indicating a lower level of agreeableness. My tendency towards negativity and critical judgments reflects this aspect of my personality.","I don't experience excessive anxiety or stress. The essay reveals a range of emotions, from hunger to annoyance to frustration, but these feelings are generally managed without escalating into significant distress or prolonged periods of anxiety. The mention of stress tests shows I am aware of stress, but there's no evidence I experience it in an overwhelming or persistent way.",n,y,n,n,n

My energy is better spent perfecting my tennis game than experimenting with wildly different activities.  While I appreciate the artistry of others, I'm not driven to explore unconventional approaches myself.  Sticking to my routine allows me to improve steadily.","Reaching a high level in competitive tennis demands intense dedication.  I meticulously plan my training, balancing practice sessions, physical conditioning, and studying game footage of top players.  I stay organized with detailed schedules and track my progress carefully.  Even setbacks, like injuries, don’t derail me; I adjust my training to compensate, always aiming to get back on track. The challenge is immense, but the rewards of constant self-improvement are very satisfying.","Being around other competitive tennis players is energizing.  The shared intensity and focus in tournaments or during intense practice sessions create a motivating atmosphere. I thrive on the camaraderie and shared goal; the energy is infectious. In contrast, solitary practice sessions, while crucial, can leave me somewhat drained. The social element in team sports, or even just talking shop with other players after a match, is essential to my well-being and helps me stay motivated.","While I'm generally easy-going, I've had disagreements with coaches over training methods or strategies.  I always strive for a collaborative approach, carefully explaining my perspective and actively listening to theirs.  Compromise is important to me; we need to find a training approach that works for both of us to meet our common goal of improving my game. Respectful communication is key to resolving any conflicts.","The pressure of competing at a high level can sometimes lead to anxiety, especially before important matches. But I handle it by focusing on my preparation and trusting the training I've done. Instead of letting nervousness paralyze me, I view it as a sign of my commitment and determination.  Maintaining a positive attitude and believing in my ability to succeed are my strategies to cope with pressure.",n,y,y,y,n
344,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I prefer familiar activities and routines.  The sorority date dash was fun, but mostly because I saw people I knew.  I'm not one for drastically changing my habits or exploring completely unfamiliar territory.","Getting my grandpa a birthday gift is a goal I need to tackle. I'll probably just get him a UT hat; it's simple, effective, and I can get it done quickly. I'm not big on extensive planning, but I get things done efficiently, prioritizing what needs immediate attention. That usually works for me.","The date dash was a social event that didn't really drain me, but I wouldn’t say I was energized either. It was fine – I talked to some people I knew, and that was enjoyable. Large groups and constant socializing aren't my thing, though. I value my alone time.","My roommate's church situation is a good example.  I can relate to feeling uncomfortable in some intensely religious settings, but I wouldn't directly confront him about it. I'm not about to tell someone how to live their life, even if I disagree with their choices. I just keep things to myself.","The essay doesn't detail a specifically stressful or anxious situation.  However,  the fact that I'm tired from a late night and my neighbors' music is bothersome suggests that external stimuli can sometimes be mildly annoying. But generally, I handle annoyances pretty well. I don't dwell on these things.",n,y,n,n,n

I was motivated by curiosity—I'd heard it was challenging but interesting, and I wanted to see if I could handle it.

To manage my time, I'm breaking it down into smaller tasks and scheduling specific times to work on it.  It can be challenging to stay motivated, especially when other things come up, but I try to prioritize it and use rewards like going out to eat with friends afterwards to stay committed.","Social interactions can be draining, especially with family.  I value close relationships with a few selected friends, like Alex,  but family interactions, especially with my sister, can sometimes feel overwhelming.  I realize I need time alone to recharge after more extroverted activities.","Alex and I had a disagreement because my dating life impacted our friendship dynamic.  I tried to be understanding of his feelings, and I prioritized open communication to work it out.  To me, maintaining healthy friendships is important, so I made an effort to discuss the issue rather than ignoring it.","My anxieties flare when my computer's broken and I feel helpless.

I'm hoping to use that newfound skill in Mexico someday!","Getting a job is a big priority, so I’m trying to be really organized about my application. I've made a checklist to make sure I don't forget anything, and I set reminders to help me stick to my deadlines. Though I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the number of tasks I have to juggle, ticking things off my list helps me stay focused and motivated. I also know procrastination isn't really my friend, it just causes more anxiety.","Large, loud social gatherings aren't really my thing.  I tend to feel drained rather than energized in those kinds of settings. I prefer smaller, more intimate get-togethers with close friends.  I've learned that it's okay to prioritize my need for quiet time to recharge after social interactions, even if it means occasionally declining invitations.

We’re going to do both of our ideas, eventually!","I tend to feel anxious when I'm facing a lot of uncertainty, like job applications. My initial response is often worry.

The cool water was particularly amazing after a hot hike.","I'm currently working on improving my guitar skills to contribute to a musical performance for ""The Happening."" It requires consistent practice, which I manage by scheduling dedicated practice time and using positive reinforcement (like rewarding myself with some knuckle cracking after a good practice session!). I find challenges come up mostly when I'm too tired or unmotivated, but I'm determined to keep my schedule. I feel rewarded when I improve, knowing that I'm making meaningful progress.","A recent social experience that energized me was spending time with friends at Hamilton Pool. The shared activity, the beautiful surroundings, and the relaxed atmosphere fostered meaningful connections.  Conversely, loud conversations from the people down the hall drain my energy, highlighting my preference for quieter, more intimate interactions.  The contrast helps me understand my need for balance.","Disagreements arise, particularly when people talk loudly in the dorm, but I try to handle them by closing my door to minimize the disturbance rather than confront anyone directly.

To stay on track with my studies, I use a planner and prioritize tasks, but I admit that sometimes my spontaneity leads to procrastination.  While I strive for balance, sometimes my short-term desires override long-term goals. The rewarding part is the feeling of accomplishment when I achieve a goal despite setbacks, and my biggest challenge is consistently maintaining self-discipline.","A recent party with close friends was incredibly energizing.

Adrian, however, makes me feel seen and understood.","Disagreements are exhausting, especially if the other person doesn’t get my point of view. I tend to avoid conflict. I'll usually give in, even if I think I'm right, just to keep the peace.  My priority is avoiding confrontation and maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising my own feelings.","When I feel stressed or anxious, I tend to overthink and become consumed by negative thoughts. It usually starts with obsessively considering things and spirals quickly into self-doubt. This essay is a clear example of that!

I used various online resources and set aside specific time slots each day, rewarding myself for milestones achieved.  The biggest challenge was maintaining consistency, especially when I felt overwhelmed, but the sense of accomplishment upon finishing was highly rewarding.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. While I enjoy the company of close friends, crowded events feel overwhelming and lead to a need for significant alone time afterward. I think it's because I prefer deeper connections to superficial interactions, and I recharge best in quiet settings.","I recently disagreed with a friend about a political issue. We discussed our differing views calmly, focusing on understanding each other’s perspectives rather than trying to win an argument.  My priority was to maintain our friendship, even if we didn't agree on everything.  It reinforced the importance of respectful communication, even when opinions clash.",I’ve felt stressed when facing major deadlines at work.  My initial response is to become intensely focused and work hard.  I take breaks to exercise or listen to music to regulate my emotions and avoid burnout.  Focusing on achievable sub-goals and positive self-talk is helpful in managing the anxiety.,y,y,n,y,n
354,"Trying something new is a regular occurrence for me.  Taking a dance class, for instance, was a spontaneous decision, fueled by a desire to try something different and social. It's been incredibly fun and has expanded my horizons beyond my usual activities, proving that stepping outside my comfort zone is rewarding.","Balancing my studies, social life, and volleyball requires careful planning. I use a planner to schedule my time and prioritize tasks, ensuring that I dedicate enough time to my classes while still making time for my friends and volleyball.  Sometimes, staying on top of my reading for psychology is challenging, but the feeling of accomplishment after completing a task is really motivating.","The football game tonight, followed by homework and bed, is my ideal evening. I'm energized by social interactions, especially with close friends, but I need time alone to recharge.  The balance of socializing and solitude is key to maintaining a healthy social life; sometimes, even my favorite people can be exhausting if I don't manage my time well.","My roommate's late nights are a source of minor conflict.  Instead of confrontation, I'm trying to find a compromise, perhaps by suggesting quiet hours or earplugs. I value our friendship but also need adequate sleep for my studies, so prioritizing open communication and mutual respect is important in resolving this.","I generally handle stress well.  The pressure of keeping up with my studies and extracurricular activities can be overwhelming at times, but I usually address it by prioritizing tasks and ensuring that I'm getting enough sleep and exercise.

The essay doesn't describe any instances where I actively pursued novelty or significantly changed my way of thinking.  Instead of trying new things, I tend to focus on what I know and what makes me comfortable, which is not much.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My essay shows a lack of consistent effort towards academic pursuits (the Chemistry quiz) and a job search, suggesting a lack of organization and planning.  I prioritize immediate gratification over sustained effort, and challenges often lead to procrastination rather than proactive problem-solving. I also haven't cared about responsibilities or following rules.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained rather than energized. The essay reveals a preference for limited social engagement; I'm not particularly outgoing, and I don't really crave or seek out lots of social interactions. While I engage with various guys, it seems to be driven by a desire for connection rather than for the pure enjoyment of social interaction. My emotional response to these interactions suggests a preference for solitude or small, intimate relationships instead.","I tend to avoid conflict and don't prioritize maintaining harmony over expressing my own needs or opinions.  The essay highlights my detached attitude towards my stepmother and difficulties relating to my family.  While I might avoid direct confrontation, my lack of emotional investment suggests a lack of concern for others' feelings or a desire to find common ground.","I experience significant emotional distress and instability. My essay details my constant feeling of sickness, low energy, past bouts of crying, and overall dissatisfaction with life.  These feelings don't manifest as anxiety, but rather as a deep-seated unhappiness and discontent which leads me to a pervasive sense of unease.  I don't actively seek out strategies to manage my emotions; instead I just live with them.",n,n,n,n,y
356,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying new things. I'm pretty set in my ways, preferring the familiar.  The only significant change I’ve recently made is buckling down to study for college, which feels extremely new.  Honestly, fear of failing in college motivated me, not any inherent desire for novelty. I feel… apprehensive about it all.","I'm not naturally organized.  Getting my math homework done after a year of procrastination is a testament to the sheer terror of failing college.  I didn't really have a structured plan; more like a last-minute panic-driven surge.  Staying committed? Let's just say there was a lot of procrastination punctuated by frantic bursts of activity. It’s definitely challenging, but the reward of completing it provides a temporary sense of relief.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  Even then, I tend to remain reserved.  My social interactions mostly revolve around my goals; I'm not particularly drawn to socializing for its own sake.  The energy I expend is better used to focus on my studies.","Disagreements are uncomfortable, but I try to approach them with empathy, prioritizing understanding the other person's perspective. I usually try to find a compromise, keeping the relationship harmonious.  Avoiding conflict is generally my preference, especially if it is not in my best interests.","Stress and anxiety? Those are my constant companions.  My initial response to overwhelming feelings is worry and self-doubt.

I guess I don't always follow through perfectly, but I try my best. I mentioned wanting to work hard this year and I did aim for that high GPA because I know I can do better.","I enjoy being around my friends and boyfriend, like when we did laundry together.  Social interactions energize me, as long as it's with people I'm close to. I would rather spend time with my close friends than attending large social gatherings. That's why I'm comfortable doing laundry with my friends - it is a social activity that doesn't drain me.","I generally try to get along with people, even if we disagree. I try to see things from their perspective, like how I recognize my parents miss me and feel bad about that.  The essay highlights my agreeable nature.","I can get stressed, especially about school and grades.  However, I don't dwell on it too much. I try to focus on what I can control and get on with things.  I don't seem to have trouble managing my stress or anxiety, even though school makes me nervous.",n,n,y,y,n

It's just easier and less stressful for me to stay within my comfort zone.","Planning and sticking to schedules aren't really my strong suit.  I often feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I need to do. I usually just react to whatever feels most pressing at the moment, which isn't very effective.  I struggle with prioritization and time management and often find myself feeling behind.","Social situations tend to leave me feeling drained. I find it really tiring to be around a lot of people, even if they are my friends. I prefer to be alone with my thoughts and don't have much energy for socializing, especially when I am already feeling overwhelmed and lost like I am now.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually just try to agree with them or just avoid the conversation. It's less stressful and emotionally taxing, but I'm not sure it's the most constructive way to handle things. It's a lot of energy I just don't want to spend.",I felt incredibly anxious and lost on my first day of college.  I felt overwhelmed by the uncertainties of a new environment and uncertain of my future. My response was to withdraw and avoid people.

My love of thrillers like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Primal Fear"" shows my appreciation for complex narratives and clever storytelling.  Trying new genres or directors keeps things interesting for me; it's a way to expand my understanding of different perspectives and artistic styles.  The experience of watching those movies is a pleasant diversion from my generally focused and goal-oriented approach to life.","I'm driven to achieve my goals, particularly academic ones;  I'm aiming for a 4.0 GPA this semester and constantly pushing myself to stay on track, even when faced with obstacles like a broken VCR or a malfunctioning online system.  My approach involves meticulous planning and self-discipline, although I do acknowledge a tendency to be overly strict on myself at times.  The reward is the satisfaction of knowing I'm striving for what I deem important.","I'm not naturally outgoing; social interactions can be draining, as illustrated by my ""pathetic party pooper"" comment.  While I enjoy the company of close friends and my girlfriend, large social gatherings or extended periods of socializing often leave me feeling depleted.  The effort required to participate in these events outweighs the enjoyment derived from them. This is why my time is prioritized to my close relationships.","I tend to approach disagreements with a focus on resolving the issue pragmatically rather than focusing on emotional responses. While the essay doesn't describe a specific conflict, my competitiveness with my brother and the desire to succeed academically suggest I might be assertive when it comes to achieving my objectives.

While the trip itself wasn't exactly what I expected, the sheer act of stepping outside my comfort zone and embarking on an adventure with friends was exhilarating. I enjoyed the challenge of meeting new people and navigating a new environment, even if the experience highlighted the differences between my current social circle and my past.","My goal for this year is to achieve a 4.0 GPA while still having fun. To stay on track, I'm focusing on time management, prioritizing my studies, and actively seeking help when needed.  While dealing with my roommate's less-than-ideal behavior has presented unexpected challenges, I'm committed to my academic goals, recognizing that maintaining my focus will yield a more positive experience and long-term rewards.","The Galveston trip was a mixed bag. Meeting new people at college has been exciting, though trying to remember everyone's names is a challenge! However, the Labor Day trip itself, while fun in its own way, felt slightly draining and highlighted that I need quieter, more intimate social experiences to really feel fulfilled. Being around younger friends and their preoccupation with rule-breaking made me feel a bit out of sync with them.","My roommate Paul has presented significant challenges this semester.  His irresponsible behavior has caused multiple problems, from a broken windshield to almost getting us evicted. While I am deeply frustrated by his actions, I've tried to handle the situation patiently and constructively. My priority is to maintain my own sanity and academic success while living with him, focusing on maintaining a respectful distance while still holding my own space.","Dealing with my roommate's chaotic behavior has been incredibly stressful.

When I set a goal, I create a detailed plan, breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks. I use to-do lists and calendars to track my progress. Even when unexpected problems arise, I adjust my plan and persevere. It's rewarding to see a project through to completion, knowing I've met my own high standards.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.

My priority is to listen to the other person's perspective, explain my own viewpoint calmly, and find a compromise or solution that works for both of us.

I initially felt frustrated and annoyed, but chose to address it calmly. I prioritized maintaining a friendly relationship with her; she's not inherently malicious, and overall, I like having her as a roommate. Ultimately, I just had a direct but polite conversation to emphasize the importance of asking first.","This morning, my roommate kept waking me up, and I found myself feeling really stressed and anxious, which often leads to a sense of overwhelm.  Initially, I felt irritated and resentful, but I tried to take deep breaths to calm down and refocus.

I’ve often relied on last-minute cramming, which isn’t the best approach. But this semester feels different; I'm attempting to take things more seriously, though the six-day deadline for my boyfriend’s anniversary gift is a bit nerve-wracking.  My methods for managing time and resources are clearly inconsistent.","Spending time with my boyfriend is incredibly energizing.  Our relationship is very important to me, and the creative gifts we exchange reflect that.  The essay shows the importance of this connection, and how it motivates me even during stressful times.

The handmade gifts described in my essay show that I put a lot of effort into showing my appreciation for my boyfriend. Even when I'm upset, as I was when he gave me the poorly sewn heart, I still cherish the gesture. I would prioritize resolving a conflict through understanding and communication rather than confrontation.","I definitely experience anxiety, as evidenced by my procrastination and stress over my upcoming deadline.  I'm worried about not being able to find the perfect anniversary gift, and balancing school work.

It was definitely outside my comfort zone, but I felt a sense of accomplishment.","I set a goal to learn a new programming language. I created a detailed study schedule, breaking down the learning process into smaller, manageable chunks.  I used various online resources and consistently set aside specific time blocks for studying, even on weekends.

The reward was gaining a new skill and the satisfaction of completing a challenging task.","Large social gatherings usually leave me feeling drained. I find them overwhelming and exhausting because of the constant social interaction required. It’s a lot of pressure to keep up appearances.

Yeah, I have them, I suppose.  Like quitting smoking, for example.  But I don't really have any specific strategies for achieving them.

I had a date recently, and although I was looking forward to it,  I spent most of it coughing and feeling self-conscious, which probably wasn't great for the other person.

I am not one for radical change or trying something that makes me feel uncomfortable.","I'm pretty organized and like to get things done early.  For instance, I finished a huge letter to a friend and some homework early so I didn't have to worry about it later.  Managing my time is important to me, I don't like to stress over deadlines.

I created a detailed study schedule, prioritized tasks, and utilized resources like tutoring and study groups.  Staying committed was sometimes tough, especially during social events, but I used reward systems and self-discipline to overcome challenges. This experience taught me the value of planning, dedication, and the profound satisfaction of achieving a difficult goal.","A recent trip to a music festival was incredibly energizing.  The positive atmosphere, the shared passion for music with others, and the spontaneous interactions fueled my energy throughout the entire weekend. This reinforced my preference for social settings that are stimulating and engaging, but I also recognize the need to balance these experiences with quieter time for reflection.","I once had a significant disagreement with a close friend regarding political issues. Instead of getting defensive, I tried to listen empathetically to their perspective, focusing on understanding their reasoning rather than just proving them wrong.  My priority was to preserve our friendship, so I sought common ground and found areas of agreement to de-escalate the conflict.","While I generally don't experience high levels of anxiety,  I did feel stressed during a particularly demanding academic project.  My initial reaction was to procrastinate, but I quickly recognized this wasn't helpful. Instead, I broke the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and focused on completing each step methodically. This approach, along with regular exercise, effectively managed my stress levels.",y,y,y,y,n
374,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I'm quite content with my routine and familiar things. The essay reflects my lack of desire for change or exploration, preferring the comfort of the familiar, even if it's causing me pain. Trying something new just doesn't appeal to me right now.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  The essay shows my lack of motivation and feeling overwhelmed by expectations.  Time management isn't really a strength, and I tend to procrastinate or avoid tasks that seem challenging. My current emotional state makes focusing on anything difficult.","Social interaction often leaves me drained and overwhelmed. The essay reveals my desire to connect with friends but also the pain and awkwardness these interactions cause. Large groups or prolonged social engagements are exhausting, and I prefer smaller, more intimate connections when I'm feeling up to it.","I try to be understanding and accommodating in disagreements, prioritizing maintaining relationships. Even though I'm upset with Connie, the essay shows my attempts to keep the peace. I value harmony and avoid direct confrontation, even if it means putting my own feelings aside, at least initially.","Stress and anxiety tend to manifest as sadness and depression. The essay expresses a great deal of emotional turmoil and self-doubt. My initial response is often to withdraw and isolate myself; however, I do seek comfort in writing and through prayer. I also find some relief in expressing my feelings, even if the process is painful.",n,n,n,y,y
375,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  Things like trying new foods or going to different types of parties are fun, but I'm not driven to explore radically different lifestyles or perspectives. I'm pretty happy with my routine and the things I already enjoy.","I'm not the most organized person.  I'll focus on things when they need immediate attention, like getting my red wing boots for the game,  but long-term planning isn't my strong suit.  I often find myself scrambling at the last minute,  and although that causes some stress, it hasn't stopped me from getting things done.","Meeting new people and being social definitely energizes me. The mixer sounds awesome; I'm looking forward to meeting girls.  Being around my pledge brothers is great too – we always have a good time together.  Conversely, I avoid situations where I feel obligated to interact with people I don't click with; some of my suite mates are a little too shy, making social events less enjoyable.","I can be pretty straightforward. If there's a conflict, I usually try to resolve it quickly and efficiently, maybe not always diplomatically. I value getting things done, even if that means ignoring some smaller points of disagreement.  My priorities are always on getting my immediate needs and goals met.","I don't usually worry too much.  Sure, the upcoming tests are a bit daunting since I've never taken college exams before, but I figure I'll do fine.  I am a bit stressed about losing muscle mass due to the food situation, but I deal with it by making light of it and planning to compensate later; I'm not usually worried for long periods.",n,n,y,n,n
376,Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer the familiar and comfortable.  I stick to what I know.  The thought of something completely different stresses me out.,"I struggle with long-term goals and planning.  Things often fall through the cracks.  I'm more reactive than proactive, dealing with issues as they arise rather than planning ahead.  It's easier that way.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller gatherings, or even just being alone.  Large crowds are overwhelming and exhausting.  I recharge by spending time on my own.","Disagreements are difficult. I often avoid direct confrontation, and if I can't avoid it, I get very upset easily. My priority is to get the conflict over with as quickly as possible, even if it means compromising my own wants or needs.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions.

While I like my English class and my small group, it's not something radically different from what I've experienced before.  New things can be overwhelming, and I'm more comfortable sticking to what I know.","I'm not the most organized person.  Goals often get pushed aside, especially if unexpected things come up.  I mostly just try to get things done when I feel like it and manage time in a rather haphazard way. I'm more focused on what I enjoy in the moment.","Spending time with close friends, like Connor, is energizing.  Sharing a space, even casually, is enjoyable.  Large, loud social gatherings, or situations where I feel pressured to interact, on the other hand, tend to drain me. I value close friendships and small, intimate settings more than anything else.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict, even if it means swallowing my feelings. My priorities are to keep the peace and maintain relationships; direct confrontation isn't my style. If someone commits to something without including me, like my friend did regarding housing, it hurts my feelings.","I get stressed easily. When I'm overwhelmed – like thinking about classes or finances – I often withdraw or worry about things endlessly. My initial response is to avoid the issue or focus on something else entirely, like caring for children.  This avoids addressing the problem immediately but is my coping method.",n,n,y,n,y
378,"I’ve always been drawn to new experiences.  For example, taking that psychology class was a total leap of faith. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the professor seemed interesting and the subject matter sounded, well, different. It turned out to be one of my most enjoyable classes, and I met some really cool people, like that girl with the awesome face.  The experience solidified my belief in the value of stepping outside my comfort zone.","Honestly, setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to be more spontaneous. I have good intentions, but rarely do detailed plans; I'm more about reacting to opportunities as they come up. I guess that explains why I didn't finish my BA 101 assignment in a timely manner – I just ended up rambling about everything else on my mind.","Going to Edgefest was definitely an energizing social experience.  Being surrounded by so many people, the music, the excitement—it was intoxicating. I wish I'd gone to the first one!  Conversely, being stuck in a boring class with no one else there was draining.  I thrive on engaging interactions and shared enthusiasm; quiet, solitary activities really sap my energy.  I value being around people that are fun and interesting.","I try to be understanding, but conflicts can be tough.  When Sarah acted like a little kid, I just couldn't stand her arrogance and childish behavior, but I didn't confront her directly. I just wrote about my feelings about it in this essay.  Honestly, keeping the peace isn't always my top priority if the other person isn’t behaving in a way I appreciate.","I don't often get stressed or anxious. If anything, I usually just get frustrated when things don't go my way like no one showing up for my BA 101 class. My initial reaction is usually irritation, but I quickly move on. I don't dwell on negative emotions; I try to focus on the positive aspects of situations. I'm pretty easy-going most of the time.",y,n,y,y,n
379,I'm always up for trying new things;  the essay mentions my desire to learn about astronomy and my spontaneous idea to create a treetop rope system. The motivation behind these stems from a deep curiosity and a desire for novel experiences. The feeling afterward is one of exhilaration and excitement about the possibilities.,"I'm not particularly detail-oriented or focused on long-term goals, as shown by my somewhat impulsive decisions and lack of planning in the essay. I tend to act more on spur-of-the-moment ideas rather than diligently pursuing carefully laid-out plans. While this can be exhilarating, it does sometimes lead to missed opportunities.","I thrive in social situations, as evidenced by my eagerness to meet new people at the astronomy lab and my willingness to go to a movie with John.  Fulfilling social experiences are those where I feel connected to others, can easily share my thoughts and feelings, and experience a sense of shared laughter and joy.  Draining experiences are rarer and often involve overly serious or judgmental interactions.","I generally prioritize maintaining harmony in my relationships.  The essay shows that I strive to avoid conflict, particularly romantic ones, to the point of implementing almost scientific strategies to maintain friendships. I believe in open communication and mutual understanding, even when disagreements arise.","I generally don't experience intense or prolonged periods of anxiety or stress. While the essay mentions feeling down after my period and some sadness related to my ex-boyfriend, these are presented as relatively transient moods, not as crippling or pervasive anxieties.  I have coping mechanisms for managing those feelings, including relying on my sister's influence and finding solace in music.",y,n,y,y,n
380,I don't really seek out new experiences.  Sticking to what I know and what's comfortable is more my style.  Novelty isn't really a motivator for me; I'd rather spend my time watching TV. The thought of trying something completely new fills me with a bit of anxiety.,"I'm definitely not known for my organization or time management skills.  I tend to procrastinate a lot, putting things off until the very last minute.  Staying committed to goals is a real struggle; my attention wanders easily.  While I might *start* something, completing it isn't always a priority.","Going out with friends is definitely a source of energy and fun for me, I get a rush from being around other people and being social!  However, some group settings can leave me feeling drained, like big parties or loud bars. The right kind of social interaction is something that really recharges me, it needs to be easy-going and fun.","Disagreements can be tough.  I might avoid direct confrontation or try to smooth things over quickly, even if it means compromising on what I want.  My priority is to keep things peaceful and avoid upsetting others, even if it means ignoring my own needs or opinions.","Going to the hospital to see my sick grandmother is a perfect example of something that makes me anxious.

381,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and experiences, even if they're unconventional.  My stream-of-consciousness writing style reflects this—it's a way for me to process thoughts and feelings without constraint. Downloading a new version of Netscape, even though it took a long time, was an example of trying something new to solve a problem. The experience, while time-consuming, felt ultimately satisfying.","I struggle with long-term goal setting and sustained effort. My essay shows a lack of focus and organization, jumping between unrelated thoughts and tasks.  The modem download is a good example:  I started it but didn’t manage my time effectively around it. The lack of structure isn't something I necessarily strive to change.",Social interactions can be draining for me. My writing is mostly internal and self-focused; there's limited discussion of interactions with other people. The mention of my brother's girlfriend being online evokes a neutral response rather than an eager engagement.  I prefer solitary activities and internal reflection.,"Conflict isn't something I directly address in my essay.  My writing style suggests a preference for avoiding direct confrontation and instead focusing on my own thoughts and feelings.  I don't describe any disagreements or how I resolve them, which suggests a lack of focus on the perspectives of others.","I experience high levels of stress and anxiety. My essay reveals this through complaints about physical pain (neck, hip), frustration with technology, and a preoccupation with my own discomfort and negative feelings (heat, humidity, the modem).  While I mention fantasizing about self-harm, it is presented as a fleeting thought rather than a serious plan.",y,n,n,n,y

While I appreciate novelty in others, I personally find more satisfaction in deepening my understanding of things I already enjoy.","I'm pretty organized and goal-oriented.  Maintaining my academic schedule is a big priority for me, requiring careful time management and planning.  I use to-do lists and prioritize tasks to stay on track.  While occasionally I procrastinate, I generally manage to meet deadlines and stay committed to my goals, as evidenced by my success in school. The rewarding part is the feeling of accomplishment when I complete a project or meet a goal.","Social interactions are definitely energizing for me, particularly when I'm with people I care about, like Natalie.  Spending time with close friends and loved ones leaves me feeling refreshed and positive.  On the other hand, large, unfamiliar social settings can be draining. My social preferences are clearly for close, intimate relationships rather than broad acquaintanceships.","When disagreements arise, I prioritize maintaining positive relationships. I try to approach the situation calmly and understandingly, seeking common ground and finding a solution that works for everyone involved. I value harmony and avoid confrontation unless absolutely necessary. The essay demonstrates my care for my relationship with Natalie, and willingness to forgive her flaws.","I generally don't experience high levels of stress or anxiety.  When challenges arise, I tend to address them rationally and focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the negative emotions.  My ability to stay calm and optimistic is a strength that helps me effectively navigate difficulties.  My positive outlook and confidence in my abilities appear in the essay.",n,y,y,y,n
383,"I've always been fascinated by different cultures and cuisines, so last year I decided to take a cooking class focused on Moroccan tagines.  The motivation was purely curiosity – I wanted to expand my culinary horizons beyond my usual three dishes.  The experience was incredibly rewarding; I learned a new skill and gained a deeper appreciation for a different culture through its food.","Honestly, setting and sticking to long-term goals isn't really my strong suit. I tend to get sidetracked easily, and my plans are more like suggestions than concrete schedules.  If something truly interests me, I'll jump in, but sustained effort isn't really my style. I guess the ""reward"" is the satisfaction of completing a task and the ""challenge"" is even starting it.","Social interactions generally drain me, especially large gatherings or events where I have to maintain constant engagement. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to. Spending time with my mom on the phone, for example, is comforting – it’s familiar and low-pressure. This has helped me understand that I’m more of an introvert and need plenty of quiet time to recharge.","I tend to avoid conflict, often agreeing to things even when I disagree internally. I prioritize maintaining harmony and good relationships above asserting my own opinions forcefully.  If a disagreement arises, I try to find common ground or politely let it go, rather than engage in a direct confrontation. This approach might not always be the most assertive, but it keeps things peaceful.","I get anxious easily, especially when things don't go according to plan. For example, cooking a roast – it felt like a big challenge. My initial response is to feel overwhelmed, but I try to break down the task into smaller steps, focus on what I *can* control, and call my mom for reassurance. This helps ease the anxiety and makes the process feel more manageable.",y,n,n,y,y

I found the experience rewarding and challenging, though I am still in the early stages of learning the language and expect to experience a great deal more challenge in the future.","Balancing my pledgeship responsibilities, my business, and my social life has been a significant challenge. I use a planner and to-do lists to manage my time effectively, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Prioritizing is key, and I've learned to say no to some commitments to avoid burnout.  Despite the hectic schedule, I find it incredibly rewarding to achieve my goals and succeed in multiple facets of my life.",My most memorable social experience recently was my first pledge party.  It was incredibly energizing because of the social connections and excitement around my fraternity pledgeship and the fun that ensued.  Being around so many people and developing friendships fueled my energy level. It confirmed my preference for social interaction and its effect on my overall mood.,"I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but when conflicts arise, my priority is understanding the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree. I approach discussions in a calm and collaborative manner, focusing on finding common ground and compromise.  It's important to listen carefully and express my own views with consideration.","I am not particularly prone to stress or anxiety, as evidenced by my calm and confident tone while writing this essay despite being pressed for time. I generally approach challenges with a level-headedness and optimism.  If I do feel overwhelmed, I find that taking a deep breath and breaking tasks down can help me manage my feelings and maintain a productive mindset.",y,y,y,y,n
385,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying completely new things.  I stick to what I know and what makes me comfortable.  Novelty isn't really a motivator for me; I prefer routine and predictability.  The only time I might stray from that is if something directly impacts my relationships with people I care about, like Thinh.","I'm very focused on achieving my goals, even if it takes a lot of work. My schedule is carefully planned to fit everything in; organic chemistry, physics, and microeconomics are a huge undertaking.  I meticulously manage my time to meet deadlines and rarely miss a task. It is challenging, but I find it rewarding to achieve what I set out to do.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining, depending on the people involved. I feel energized when spending time with Thinh; his thoughtfulness is endearing.  However, interacting with people I dislike, like Priya, leaves me feeling depleted and irritated.  I have a clear preference for spending time with a smaller circle of close friends rather than large crowds.","Disagreements are never fun. When I disagree with someone, like Nhut, I prioritize direct communication, but I can also become quite blunt and even mean.  While I value maintaining relationships, I also want my feelings and expectations to be acknowledged and respected. An apology would go a long way, in his case.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions for me.  I react to them with a mix of irritability and self-pity.  Managing my emotions involves careful scheduling to prioritize tasks, and I try to take a break (nap) after a stressful day. It's a work in progress; finding ways to stay more calm is hard.",n,y,n,y,y

Reading about places like Paris, for example, sparked a desire to experience something entirely different from my current routine.  The idea of traveling, even if just to live simply, really appeals to me – a kind of escape, maybe.  The thought of it makes me feel both excited and a little anxious, honestly.","I struggle with organization, as you can probably tell from my essay. Setting goals and sticking to them has always been a challenge. Although I know I *should* be reading and studying more, I often procrastinate. I have good intentions, really, but my planning and follow-through leave much to be desired.","Social situations generally drain me. I long for deeper connections, but I find large groups of people exhausting.  The thought of initiating conversations with strangers makes me anxious. I'm more comfortable in smaller settings with people I already know well, though even then I can sometimes feel overwhelmed.","Disagreements are difficult for me.

I used planners and to-do lists to stay organized, and I prioritized tasks based on deadlines and importance.  Although there were times I felt overwhelmed, the reward of graduating on schedule made the hard work worthwhile.  The most challenging aspect was maintaining focus when distractions arose, but breaking down large tasks into smaller ones helped.","Going to a broomball game with friends was a very energizing experience. The laughter, friendly competition, and camaraderie were incredibly uplifting.  The interaction felt fulfilling because I was surrounded by people I enjoyed being around, and it reaffirmed my preference for social engagement and energetic environments.","I once had a disagreement with a roommate about shared expenses.  Rather than focusing on ""winning"" the argument, my priority was finding a fair and equitable solution that maintained our friendship. We sat down, calmly discussed our different perspectives, and worked out a compromise.","I felt particularly stressed when a major project at school was due soon.

I tend to be more spontaneous in my actions and approaches. This lack of planning sometimes leads to missed opportunities, but I don't find it overly stressful.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  The club last night was a perfect example—the noise, the crowds, and the constant social interaction left me feeling exhausted and anxious. This experience reinforced my preference for quiet evenings and smaller groups of close friends.","I try to avoid direct conflict, so when disagreements arise, I often prioritize maintaining the relationship. If someone is upset, I tend to listen and try to understand their perspective, even if I don't agree. In the situation with my roommate and the girl I like, I prioritize avoiding hurting my friend's feelings, even if it means suppressing my own desires.","The situation with my roommate and the girl I like causes me significant anxiety.

It pushed me to learn about a different perspective on competition and fairness, and afterwards, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a broadened understanding of how ingrained gender bias can be, even in seemingly objective fields. The experience motivated me to be more conscientious of my own unconscious biases.","Getting into medical school is a huge goal of mine, so I'm meticulously planning my studies and MCAT preparation. I'm organized, making detailed schedules and utilizing resources like practice tests and study groups to stay on track. Even with the distractions of college life, I prioritize my studies, and the challenge of succeeding is deeply rewarding because it makes me feel successful. While I try to maintain balance, sometimes I have to really push myself to maintain this balance and to remember to relax and enjoy life.","I love being around people and always have tons of fun with my buddies, especially at football games or simply hanging out and enjoying the social atmosphere of college.

It made me realize how much I need those kinds of experiences to unwind.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  I often forget deadlines, like I did with the assignment.  I don't really have specific strategies for managing my time, more of a go-with-the-flow approach.  I suppose that’s why I end up scrambling at the last minute sometimes.","Spending time with Angela is always energizing.  We have so much in common, and she understands me.

Afterwards, I was definitely drained, but also proud of that accomplishment.","Goals and sustained effort?  Not really my strong suit.  I started playing football at A&M, but that fizzled out rather quickly. I wasn’t very organized or disciplined about training and frankly, lacked the motivation to really commit long-term.

My girlfriend's rudeness is a prime example – I find social situations stressful and prefer to be alone. I crave quiet moments and personal reflection. Engaging socially feels overwhelming and more of an obligation, causing this exhaustion, rather than an experience that invigorates me.","Disagreements are tough. With my girlfriend, I often avoid confrontation, even if I feel she's being unreasonable.  My priority is preserving the relationship, and sometimes that means swallowing my own feelings. I might just accept the situation rather than addressing the conflict directly, partly out of fear of further friction. I am more concerned about keeping the peace than expressing my discontent.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  The essay reflects this.  When stressed, I tend to become withdrawn and introspective.  I usually find solace in simple things, like moving my foot back and forth. While I don't have active coping strategies, I try to ride out the anxiety, hoping it will eventually pass.  My approach is more about avoidance and hoping for things to get better on their own.",y,n,n,y,y

The idea of sticking to a schedule stresses me out.","Being around my pledge brothers is energizing; I feel more comfortable and at ease in groups.  However, being alone in my room makes me feel homesick and anxious; I crave the company of others for comfort and distraction.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize it rather than confront them directly.  I prioritize avoiding unpleasantness over directly addressing disagreements.","The start of college has been incredibly stressful.  I feel overwhelmed by the academic pressure and social expectations.  My immediate response to stress is anxiety, but I try to distract myself by going out with friends and participating in fraternity activities to avoid the feelings of homesickness and anxiety.",n,n,n,n,y
395,"I'm not one for radically new experiences.  Coming to college was a big change, of course, and I'm proud of myself for taking that step, but it wasn't a leap into the unknown so much as a carefully planned transition.  The motivation was simple: to improve my future prospects.  While I'm adjusting well, I wouldn't describe it as something that broadened my horizons in a particularly exciting way.","Succeeding in college is my main goal right now. To stay on track, I've created a schedule and I'm trying to stick to it, and I prioritize my studies. I'm also focusing on building good study habits. Although it's challenging to balance everything, my determination to succeed keeps me going.  The rewarding part is the feeling of accomplishment when I complete a task or achieve a goal.","Honestly, large social gatherings leave me feeling drained. I much prefer smaller interactions.  The college environment with so many students can be overwhelming, but I find solace in connecting with a few close people. My desire for meaningful, intimate connection has become clearer since being away from home and this experience has reinforced the need for quality over quantity in my social life.","I usually try to find common ground when I disagree with someone.  For example, my goal is to understand their perspective, even if I don't necessarily agree with it. I believe that open communication is key to resolving conflict and building positive relationships, and I don't like confrontation.","Being away from home and my significant other has been very stressful. My initial response was anxiety and homesickness.  To manage it, I'm focusing on my studies, trying to stay busy, and making an effort to connect with people here.  My feelings have made me think more deeply about relationships.  While my anxieties haven't completely disappeared, the reflection has been somewhat productive.",n,y,n,y,y

I prefer the familiar and comfortable; venturing outside of that zone seems like too much effort.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  Time management isn't my strong suit; I often find myself distracted and procrastinating.  Staying committed is a constant battle, especially when faced with challenges.  The reward of accomplishment is nice, but the effort required often feels too daunting.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  Large groups or loud environments are particularly overwhelming.  Meaningful connections with a few close friends are preferable to extensive socializing.  I tend to recharge best in solitude, and I recognize that my preference is for small, intimate interactions.","I prioritize harmony in disagreements, often prioritizing the other person’s feelings and perspective.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation; I'd rather find a solution that avoids making waves.  Maintaining peaceful relationships is important to me, even if it means compromising my own viewpoint.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. My initial response is often avoidance or withdrawal.  Managing my emotions takes conscious effort – I might listen to music, spend time alone, or engage in simple, mindless activities to calm myself.  Finding constructive approaches takes time and effort; sometimes I just need to ride out the wave of emotion.",n,n,n,y,y
397,"I impulsively signed up for a pottery class a few weeks ago, something completely outside my usual routine.  The death of my best friend shattered my sense of normalcy; I needed a distraction, something to momentarily escape the overwhelming grief. While I found the process frustrating at times, the quiet focus required was actually quite therapeutic.","Honestly, I haven't been able to focus on any long-term goals lately. The loss of my friend has thrown me completely off track.  Prioritizing anything beyond getting through the day feels impossible.  My usual organizational skills and self-discipline have completely evaporated.","Social interaction right now feels draining and pointless.  I'm polite to my dorm mates, but I can't bring myself to engage deeply; their lack of understanding only fuels my resentment.  I long for the comfort of my old friends, but making new connections feels utterly impossible and completely futile.","I haven't exactly handled disagreements well recently. My emotions are raw, and I find myself becoming easily frustrated and resentful with those who don't understand my pain. I avoid direct confrontation, and honestly, I feel completely justified in my lack of empathy for others.","The death of my best friend sent me into a spiral of intense grief and anger. I've cycled through denial, rage, depression, and back again.  I find myself lashing out, withdrawing, or just feeling numb. I haven't actively sought help, but the emotional rollercoaster is exhausting.",y,n,n,n,y

New things can be a bit daunting, especially as I've been experiencing increased anxiety lately.  The thought of skydiving, for example, is exciting, but also terrifying.  My focus tends to be more on optimizing my existing interests and relationships rather than seeking out completely novel experiences.","I'm pretty organized and goal-oriented.  When I set a goal, like succeeding in my current classes, I create a plan and stick to it.  Dropping history was tough because I usually persevere, but getting good grades is crucial, so I had to make the difficult decision.  The challenging part is managing my anxiety, which sometimes makes planning and focus difficult. The reward is the feeling of accomplishment when I reach my goals.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I value close, meaningful connections with family and friends.  Spending time with loved ones, like my brother and his new girlfriend this weekend, fills me with energy.  Intimate interactions provide more fulfillment than huge events.  My social needs are centered around quality time with those I'm close to.","I try to be understanding and accommodating, even when I disagree with someone.  My priority is maintaining positive relationships.  I'll express my opinion respectfully, but I'll compromise if necessary to avoid conflict.  I believe that even in disagreements, everyone deserves to be heard and treated with kindness, especially those closest to me.","I experience anxiety frequently, and nightmares have been particularly intense recently.  My initial response to stress is often avoidance, but I recognize this isn't always the best approach. I manage it by exercising, spending time outdoors, and talking to those I trust.  These things help me process my emotions and tackle whatever is causing the stress.",n,y,n,y,y
399,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying radically new things.  I prefer things that are familiar and comfortable. Although, meeting this girl was definitely something outside of my usual routine, and I surprisingly enjoyed our late-night talks and the ease of our connection.  I guess that was pretty open of me, to just be so vulnerable with someone so quickly.","I'm not the most organized person.  I tend to go with the flow and don't often set long-term goals.  My approach to college is to see where things take me, joining clubs depending on my interest level in the moment. Time management isn't really a strength; I usually just do things when I feel like it.","Meeting this girl was definitely an energizing social experience. We just clicked, spending hours talking. The ease of the connection and the shared laughter made it incredibly fulfilling. It reinforced my preference for genuine, easygoing interactions. I enjoy being around people I connect with on a deeper level.","I haven't really had any major disagreements with this girl yet, but generally, I handle conflict by avoiding confrontation. If it gets heated, I prefer to let things settle and approach the issue again when we are both calmer. I value maintaining a good relationship; my priority is harmony rather than being right.","I don't get stressed easily.  The situation with this girl is causing me to think a lot, but not to the point of anxiety. I'm taking the ""let things run their course"" approach.

The thought of experiencing such a classic and beautiful production, escaping the daily grind, was incredibly appealing and the experience lived up to my expectations, leaving me feeling refreshed and inspired.","Juggling motherhood, coursework, and various responsibilities requires meticulous planning and organization.  I meticulously schedule my time, prioritizing tasks and utilizing any free moments—like the time between my son's bedtime and my own. Even when unexpected setbacks occur, such as my car breaking down, I adapt, making phone calls and coordinating transportation solutions, to ensure I meet my deadlines. The challenges can be overwhelming, but the feeling of accomplishment is very rewarding.","I find large social gatherings draining. While I cherish intimate moments with loved ones, like attending the musical with my family, I recharge best in quieter environments. This helps me to understand my social energy, and why I value quality time over quantity. The essay itself reflects my introverted tendencies.","I value harmony in relationships and generally try to be understanding. However, my car repair experience highlights an instance where my agreeable nature had its limits. The lack of communication from the repair shop frustrated me. It forced me to assert my needs, while still being mindful of their potentially difficult situation.","I tend to handle stress calmly and constructively. While I get frustrated easily, like with the car repair, my reaction generally involves problem-solving. My response to stress is to address the situation, plan a solution, and, when necessary, seek support, all while reminding myself that many others have greater struggles.",y,y,n,y,n

Honestly, I was terrible at it initially, but the process of creating something tangible was surprisingly rewarding. I enjoyed the messy, tactile nature of it all.","I haven't really set any long-term goals. I'm not a planner. I just sort of go with the flow, and if things work out, they work out.  I guess that's probably why I'm stressed about college right now. I wish I had been better at managing my time, but I'm more focused on enjoying the present than planning for the future.","The weekend with my fraternity brothers was definitely energizing.  Being around people who understand me and share similar interests is invigorating.  It's a stark contrast to the overwhelming anonymity of college life, which leaves me drained and feeling lost in the crowd.  I need those close, boisterous social experiences to recharge.","I haven't really had any major conflicts lately, but I tend to avoid confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I'll probably just keep my opinion to myself unless it's really important.  My priority is to maintain a peaceful, low-conflict environment, even if it means compromising my own views.","The lack of sleep and the pressure of college have definitely been triggering my anxiety.  My initial response is usually to withdraw and worry. I find comfort in spending time with my fraternity brothers as a way to distract myself. Ultimately, I need to find better coping mechanisms, but for now, the short-term solutions are my priority.",y,n,y,n,y
402,"I wouldn't say I'm one for radically new experiences. I'm more comfortable sticking to what I know.  Adding that computer science course was a bit outside my usual comfort zone – more of a practical decision to learn a useful skill than a desire for something wildly different. I felt a little apprehensive about it at first, but the sense of accomplishment and the potential future benefits outweigh the anxiety.","Staying on top of my classes requires a fair amount of planning and discipline. I try to create a schedule, prioritizing the most challenging tasks, like Calculus, and allocating specific study times for each subject.  I find it rewarding to see progress and even more so to stay afloat in my difficult classes despite challenges. The struggle to keep up with all my commitments, like the computer science course, in addition to my engineering classes can be exhausting, though.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  That's probably why I write so much in my journal, as a way to process my feelings. Spending too much time in chaotic social situations leaves me feeling overwhelmed and needing time to recharge on my own.","Disagreements aren't something I typically enjoy, but when they happen, I try to approach them with understanding and respect, prioritizing communication and finding a common ground. I find that calm consideration, rather than heated arguing, works best for me.  My priority is maintaining the relationship even if we don't see eye to eye on everything.","Feeling stressed and anxious is sadly something I'm all too familiar with.  My initial response is usually to worry, and then I try to break things down into manageable tasks.

Sometimes I feel a bit overwhelmed and hopeless, but I work through it.",n,y,n,y,y
403,"I'm fascinated by film editing techniques, like parallel editing as described in ""The Right Stuff.""  Learning about it felt like discovering a hidden layer of meaning in movies, something that expands my appreciation beyond simple entertainment. I find such intellectual pursuits engaging and stimulating.","I’m definitely not the most organized person; I missed an SI session and worry about falling behind in my studies.  I struggle to manage my time effectively, leading to last-minute rushes and anxieties, although I do eventually get things done. While I wish I were more prepared, getting good grades is a priority, and I know I will need to improve my habits.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  I tend to prefer solitary activities like watching movies. While I can be around people, large social gatherings or extended periods of socializing are generally not enjoyable.  I need time alone to recharge after interacting with others, and my ideal social interaction is a smaller group of close friends.","I don’t shy away from expressing disagreement—my frustration about the pretest is a clear example. My priority isn't always to be agreeable; I am more focused on getting things done effectively, even if it means causing minor conflict.  While I believe there are multiple perspectives on every topic, it is clear to me that I need to be more organized and proactive regarding my studies.","The pressure of college and the fear of not succeeding are major stressors.

This is probably why my relationship didn't work out—my ex and I didn't have enough time to get to know each other properly before a lot changed.","I’m quite organized and methodical. When I set a goal, I break it down into smaller, manageable steps. In this instance, staying in touch with my ex via letters, even though it's slow, was a goal.  I maintain a regular schedule for writing and sending them, and I prioritize this communication despite the distance and time lag.  The challenge is the slow pace of communication; the reward is maintaining a connection despite the geographical separation.","Social interactions aren't something I crave.  Large gatherings tend to drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to. My relationship with my ex was deeply personal, but the distance now makes it difficult. I don't seek out large social events.","I strive to be understanding and accommodating in disagreements.  In my situation with my ex, even though I wish things were different, the lack of communication doesn't mean there's conflict.  It's more a matter of distance. I prioritize maintaining a friendly relationship despite the challenges of our separation.","I tend to be quite calm and even-tempered.  While I miss my ex, I haven't experienced significant stress or anxiety.  I've accepted that our current mode of communication is what we can manage for now.

Yeah, I set them, but sticking to a plan isn't really my strong suit. If something comes up, my initial reaction is to just go with the flow and adjust as needed. I'm not big on structured time management.  If things don't go as planned, so what? I deal with it.","Large social gatherings are definitely not my thing.  I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I'm close to. Seeing Salima again is energizing because it's someone I care about, but large groups can be draining.  I've learned that I value my alone time and close relationships more than being surrounded by lots of people.","Disagreements happen, but I tend to avoid them if possible.  If I have a problem with someone, I probably won't confront them directly. Instead, I'll quietly work through my feelings or maybe just avoid the person entirely.  My priority is to minimize conflict and keep things peaceful, even if it means compromising my own perspective.","Stress and anxiety?  Yeah, I get those feelings, especially when things don't go as planned or I'm overwhelmed.  My initial response is usually to just go with the flow and hope it all sorts itself out.

My move to Austin for college was new, but it wasn’t a radical departure from my comfort zone, as it still involved familiar aspects like attending university and being near some friends.  While I’m excited about exploring Austin, I’m not looking to jump into anything overly adventurous or unconventional.","Succeeding in college is a major goal of mine, and it requires a structured approach.  I know I need to prioritize attending classes, completing assignments, and studying regularly to keep up.  I’m planning to use a planner to manage my time and make sure I stay on top of deadlines.  The three-exam grading system is daunting, but it motivates me to consistently study and review material throughout the semester; failing one could mean I have to work a lot harder.","Living on my own in Austin has been both energizing and draining, depending on the day. Meeting new people and forming connections fuels my energy, while the solitude and lack of constant interaction can leave me feeling somewhat drained. I enjoy spending time with my new acquaintances, but I also value having my alone time.  I anticipate that striking a healthy balance between socializing and solitude will be important for my well-being.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with,  Sometimes I struggle to compromise if I strongly disagree with someone.  I would prefer to stick to my views. However, if a conflict arises, I try to objectively address the issue at hand to find a solution I can accept, even if it isn't fully my way.","The shift to living on my own initially brought anxiety. The freedom feels good but also creates a sense of uncertainty.  This feeling is offset by the excitement of independence.

My approach to tasks is often spontaneous, driven more by immediate urges than by planned actions.  As the essay shows, my thoughts jump frequently between physical discomfort, hunger, and general worries, rather than focusing on any one goal.","Social interactions are not usually my primary source of energy; I often find them draining.  I tend to prefer solitary activities and quiet time to recharge.  The essay reflects this preference, focusing more on internal thoughts and feelings than external social connections.",Disagreements are handled by avoiding confrontation.  I tend to prioritize keeping the peace rather than expressing my own views forcefully.  The essay mentions concerns about pleasing others and sacrificing personal needs to do so. My approach seems more about accepting things than direct conflict resolution.,"Stress and anxiety are prominent features in my experience.

I like to get things done ahead of time; however, my initial failure to understand the waiting list system resulted in an embarrassing setback.  This taught me the importance of thorough preparation and careful attention to detail. Although I quickly rectified the mistake, it was a valuable lesson in proactive planning.","My philosophy class, while interesting, has been a mixed experience socially. The large size, combined with the intense, often argumentative nature of religious discussions, creates an environment where expressing my views feels risky.  Being challenged and made to feel “stupid” for my opinions is draining, revealing a preference for more collaborative and respectful dialogue.","The conflict with my roommate, who lied to get into our apartment, is an ongoing issue. My priority is to maintain a peaceful living environment, but it's a struggle.  I am focusing on tolerating the situation rather than confronting it directly; I am sticking it out for the sake of the stability of living arrangements.","My initial response to the frustration with the research lab and my unenjoyable SI group was self-blame, but I didn't let it consume me.

The lizard incident was humorous, but it seems more about observing others than actively participating in a social setting. I value my alone time, as the essay demonstrates my preference for solitude and focusing on personal tasks.  Large social gatherings don't appeal to me.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out.  I generally avoid conflict. The essay doesn't explicitly describe a conflict, suggesting I either avoid them or resolve them quietly and without overt confrontation. I prioritize avoiding unpleasantness.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress, as shown in the essay by my reactions to the drilling, the cold room, and the heavy workload.

While I still felt anxious about the deadline, I broke the task into manageable steps, and the feeling of accomplishment and pride as I finish this writing is helping me to regain control and feel less anxious about the future.",n,y,n,y,y

While I haven't done anything drastically different lately, starting college in a new city has been somewhat outside my comfort zone, even if it wasn't a conscious choice to pursue the unfamiliar. I'm adapting, but I don't actively seek out novelty.","Losing weight and sticking to a workout routine has been a big goal of mine.  I've created a schedule for the gym and I track my food intake meticulously.  It's challenging to resist unhealthy foods, especially when surrounded by tempting options like at the Castilian.  However, I rely on small rewards (like one treat a week) once I reach milestones to stay motivated and disciplined.","Social situations aren't really my forte; large gatherings drain me. However, having a close friend as my roommate is hugely beneficial, providing balance to my introverted nature.  The comfort and understanding we have makes it easier to navigate college life.  I prefer smaller, intimate interactions where I can be myself.","Disagreements aren't something I particularly enjoy. While I might feel strongly about my preferences, I avoid direct confrontations.  I’d rather find common ground, even if it means compromising, to maintain a harmonious relationship.  Maintaining positive relationships with those around me is important.","The power outage in the elevator, which I recall feeling anxious about, is a good example. My immediate reaction was a gasp, a physical manifestation of my anxiety.  To manage this, I usually take deep breaths and try to rationalize the situation. I focus on controlling what I can and try not to overthink things.",n,y,n,n,y
417,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I stick to what I know and what's comfortable.  The thought of doing something completely different makes me anxious. My focus is more on the familiar and the things I already enjoy.","I don't really set long-term goals or plan things out meticulously.  If something needs doing, I usually just get it done when I feel like it.  I'm not big on structure or schedules.  I tend to be spontaneous.","Being around people is usually fun for me, especially when it's with close friends or people I know well.  Large groups or formal situations can be a little draining, and I really enjoy that feeling of being with close friends, chatting and laughing.","If I disagree with someone, I usually try to avoid confrontation. I'll politely express my viewpoint, but I'm not one to argue or push my opinions forcefully. I would try to find common ground or agree to disagree.  It's more important to me to keep the peace and maintain relationships than to ""win"" an argument.","Stress doesn't really bother me that much. I tend to take things in stride and don't dwell on worries. If I'm stressed, I'll probably just hang out with friends, watch TV, or do something else to take my mind off things.  I don't tend to overthink or worry excessively.",n,n,y,y,n
418,"I don't often seek out completely new experiences.  I tend to stick to what I know, and find comfort in routine. The thought of trying something drastically different actually fills me with anxiety. I suppose that’s why I don’t have many stories of radically new experiences.","I've always been driven to meet expectations and fulfill responsibilities, which sometimes means pushing myself to my limits.  My approach is methodical: I break down large goals into smaller, manageable tasks, creating a schedule and using checklists to stay on track. I find the satisfaction of completing a goal very rewarding, even if the journey was arduous.","Social situations are a mixed bag for me. Large gatherings can leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed, while close interactions with a select few people are energizing. A truly memorable experience was a small dinner party with close friends; the intimate setting and genuine connection left me feeling refreshed and happy.  I value quality over quantity in my social life.","Disagreements are challenging.  I tend to avoid direct conflict, prioritizing maintaining a sense of order and efficiency over immediate resolution. I’ll usually try to find common ground, but if it’s not possible I will try to at least maintain a peaceful and functional relationship with the person. It’s easier for me to just move on.","I experience anxiety and stress frequently.  Initially, I might withdraw or become irritable.  To cope, I utilize structured routines and self-imposed discipline.  This helps me regain a sense of control, and while I may not eliminate the anxiety, I can at least lessen its disruptive effects.",n,y,y,n,y

I’ll try to make time for my responsibilities, but honestly, it can be tough balancing work and school and, well, life.  If I’m overwhelmed, I may not always use the most efficient methods.  Getting things done feels good, but the effort often feels draining.","Social interactions can be exhausting.  Large groups of people especially.  I prefer smaller gatherings or one-on-one interactions with those I am close to. I tend to get overwhelmed and withdrawn around lots of people, I'd rather spend my time alone or with my girlfriend.","If I disagree with someone, I tend to just let it go, unless it's really important. Confrontation isn't my thing; I'll just avoid conflict whenever possible.  It's easier to just go along with things, even if I don't completely agree.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. My mind races; I get overwhelmed easily.  I'll often just try to distract myself, maybe with food or something.

The essay reflects my tendency to focus on nostalgic memories and familiar experiences rather than exploring uncharted territory.","I'm definitely a planner. When I set a goal, I meticulously organize my time and resources to achieve it.  I create detailed schedules, prioritize tasks, and break larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps. I find that proactively addressing potential challenges is key to staying committed, and this approach is something I regularly employ.  Seeing those plans come to fruition is immensely rewarding.","I'm not someone who thrives in large, boisterous social settings.  Memorable social experiences for me are quiet, intimate gatherings with close friends and family—like the homecoming described in my essay.   Large groups can leave me feeling drained, whereas spending time with those I know well energizes me and is fulfilling, because it aligns with my introverted nature.","I generally prioritize harmony and understanding in disagreements.  Rather than confrontation, I aim for collaborative solutions.  My first concern is to understand the other person's perspective before expressing my own, and I prioritize finding common ground to resolve conflicts.  This is reflected in how I write about my desire to return home and reconnect with loved ones, showing a value of maintaining positive relationships.","Stress and anxiety aren't major issues for me. I'm usually pretty calm and level-headed.  When I do feel stressed, I tend to address the situation pragmatically—maybe with a little planning and organization, and focusing on what I can control.

I balance my fraternity activities with studying, and I try to make time for working out too – that helps me stay focused.  It's challenging to juggle everything, but the payoff of good grades is worth it.","Going to football games is definitely energizing. Being around a huge, excited crowd, cheering with everyone, is exhilarating. That kind of social interaction really makes me feel good and connected.  Quiet evenings alone? Not so much.","I try to be agreeable but I also value honesty.  When I disagree with someone, I usually try to express my thoughts directly and calmly, but if I'm pushed too far, well, my feelings can be known.  I don't want to create conflict, but I'm not going to be silent either.","Honestly, thinking about my ex-girlfriend makes me anxious and stressed.  She really messed me up.

Eating alligator at Papaduex was a spur-of-the-moment thing, more driven by curiosity than a desire for radical change. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it, but it didn't fundamentally alter my usual preferences.","I'm pretty organized, especially when it comes to the things I care about.  Right now, I'm trying to prioritize seeing ""The Horse Whisperer""—I've put it on my to-do list and I'm actively looking for opportunities to go.  I find that having a clear plan and making a point to stick to it is really helpful, but even then sometimes fatigue gets in the way.","Social situations are draining, I really do prefer to keep to myself. That story about my friend in the club was awful, and hearing about it left me feeling incredibly disturbed and unsettled. It made me realize I prefer smaller, quieter gatherings, or ideally just time alone.","I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  The situation with Annie and the nickname is something I'm not comfortable with, but I also avoid confrontation so I haven't said anything. Ideally, I'd prefer a calm, understanding approach to resolve such things, but I don't usually have the energy or inclination to pursue it.","I get stressed and anxious easily. The news about my boyfriend's coworker's death really upset me, especially since I already have a strong aversion to funerals and death.  My initial reaction was avoidance—I made an excuse to myself to postpone even thinking about it—but I do know I need to support my boyfriend.

I haven't actively explored new hobbies or ways of thinking since moving.","I managed to get through the transition to a new city quite well.  I made lists, organized my belongings efficiently before the move, and set up appointments for everything in advance.  While the move itself presented challenges, my systematic approach helped reduce stress.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I know well.  Being around a lot of people in a new city can feel overwhelming, which reinforces my preference for quiet time and close relationships.","I usually try to find common ground, even when I disagree with someone.  Instead of confrontation, I'll focus on listening and understanding their perspective before trying to explain my own. Maintaining harmony and avoiding unnecessary conflict is important to me.","I tend to bottle things up when stressed, evidenced by the lack of tears described in my essay. The move clearly brought anxiety; however, the essay shows I use journaling and writing as an outlet, though indirectly and ineffectively. While I don't actively address stress directly, I process it internally.",n,y,n,y,y

However, the cheerleading invitation was a bit outside my comfort zone, but the opportunity to try something new and potentially expand my skills is intriguing. I'm considering it, but my priorities are firmly set on my studies and career goals right now.","Balancing my classes, modeling aspirations, the potential pageant, and even the cheerleading possibility requires a structured approach. I use planners and to-do lists to manage my time effectively.  Staying committed is about prioritizing tasks, breaking larger goals into manageable steps, and knowing when to say no to something to focus on the things that truly matter to my overall success. The challenge is finding enough time, but the reward is seeing progress in all areas of my life.","The most energizing social experiences are those involving people who share my passion and ambition.  The interview with the modeling agency left me feeling excited and motivated. It was invigorating to talk about my plans and receive positive feedback.  Conversely, large, superficial social gatherings can be draining, as I prefer meaningful connections with a smaller group of people who I connect with on a deeper level.","I generally try to be understanding and cooperative, but there have been times I've had to assert my needs.  For instance, if someone's actions interfere with my academic goals, I'll politely but firmly express my concerns. My priority is always to find a solution that works for everyone involved, but I also value my own well-being and success.  Direct communication with the right tone is key for me to handle disagreements.","I can get stressed, especially juggling all my current activities, and the pressure of living independently. My initial response is usually a feeling of overwhelm, but I counter this by organizing my thoughts. I create lists, prioritize tasks, and focus on what I can control. Reaching out to my mom or friends for support also helps to keep me grounded. I've learned from past experiences that proactively addressing stress is far more effective than ignoring it.",n,y,y,y,n

College is different, and I recognize the need to change this. While I did well in high school, college requires self-discipline which is something I am lacking and need to improve on, hence my worries. I haven't established effective long-term strategies for managing my time yet.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I value close relationships with a select few rather than extensive social networks.  The essay reflects this preference for smaller, more intimate interactions where I can be myself, and avoid the pressures of larger group dynamics.  I prefer one-on-one conversations to big parties.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, sometimes to my detriment. In the essay, my annoyance at the hypocrisy of others suggests a lack of agreeableness, especially regarding their actions that clash with their stated beliefs.  I prefer not to engage in conflict head-on, and try to sidestep it when possible.","While I'm not naturally anxious, the transition to college is stressful.

I have thought about joining a service fraternity, but haven't gotten around to signing up yet.","Spending time with my boyfriend, Alan, can be both energizing and draining. When we do things together, I feel great, but sometimes our interactions lack excitement.  My attraction to Stephen seems to be fueled by the novelty and excitement he offers compared to my somewhat routine relationship.","I haven't had any major conflicts yet, but I’m finding it hard to balance my feelings for Stephen with my relationship with Alan. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, hoping things will work themselves out, though I know that isn't necessarily the best approach.","The noise from the electricians is incredibly stressful, and it makes it hard for me to relax and get some rest.

I prefer quiet time, and I don't really seek out a lot of social events. I’m comfortable being alone.","My roommates are slobs, and that bothers me. I haven't really said anything to them, though. It's not worth the effort to confront them. It's easier to just deal with it.",Feeling nauseous and sweaty is stressful. I didn't really do anything about it.  It just is what it is.

I find the process itself rewarding—the sense of progress and control I maintain throughout.","Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  Spending too much time in boisterous environments leaves me feeling exhausted. I value meaningful connections over superficial interactions, so close friends are essential to my wellbeing.","I'm not always the most agreeable person. If I disagree with someone, I'll often speak my mind directly, even if it leads to conflict.

The challenge is the fear of failure; the reward is the sense of accomplishment when a goal is reached.,"Social interactions drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends to large, boisterous parties. The essay touches on my discomfort with conversations that become stilted, reflecting my preference for less demanding social situations.  I find energy in quiet time, focusing on work or my own interests.","I'm not naturally inclined to compromise or easily resolve conflicts.  While the essay doesn't directly mention a disagreement, my overall tone suggests a preference for avoiding conflict. If pushed, I might prioritize maintaining a sense of independence and sticking to my own perspective, rather than seeking harmony.","I experience stress and anxiety, as noted in my reflection on my freshman year. Initially, I might withdraw or become preoccupied with my worries. My coping mechanisms, as revealed in the essay, include distraction (movies, TV), exercise, and reaching out to friends.  I don't rely on medication; I prefer to address the stress itself through active problem-solving.",n,y,n,n,y
438,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  I stick to what I know, and honestly, trying something completely new feels overwhelming and anxiety-provoking.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone fills me with apprehension.  I prefer familiarity and predictability.","I don't really have a system for achieving long-term goals.  I struggle with consistent effort and often find myself procrastinating or getting sidetracked.  I tend to start things with good intentions, but maintaining focus is difficult and frustrating.  Spontaneity often wins out over planning.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed.  The noise and constant interaction are exhausting.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I already know well.  I crave quiet time to recharge after even minimal social engagement.  I'm not naturally outgoing; the idea of putting myself out there to meet new people is daunting.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, sometimes even at the expense of expressing my own needs or opinions.  I prioritize maintaining a peaceful atmosphere, even if it means compromising my own views.  Direct confrontation feels uncomfortable and stressful.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  My initial response to stress is often overwhelming worry.  I tend to overthink situations and dwell on negative possibilities.

It wasn't just about memorizing vocabulary; it felt like unlocking a whole new world of perspectives and understanding.  Afterwards, I felt a deep sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, though a bit frustrated that I'm still not fluent.","I wouldn't say I'm very good at setting and achieving long-term goals.  I often get sidetracked, jumping from one thing to another before seeing anything through. The essay itself is a prime example! I struggle with sustained effort and sticking to a schedule, tending to focus on immediate impulses and anxieties instead.","I generally prefer smaller, more intimate social gatherings. Large, noisy parties or events often leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed. I need quiet time to recharge, and sometimes I find that even close friends can be overwhelming in bigger settings. I don't mind interacting socially, as long as it's not too stimulating.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  When I disagree with someone, my instinct isn't to engage in a debate. Instead, I internalize my feelings and tend to avoid direct confrontation, and I can harbor resentment for a long time afterward. I prioritize avoiding conflict, even if that means not fully expressing my opinion.","I worry a lot.  Before starting this assignment, I stressed about the length, whether the website would work, if the computer lab would be too full—a cascade of ""what ifs."" This anxiety fuels my planning, so it's almost a helpful personality trait for me. I manage my worries by anticipating potential problems and making plans to avoid them.",y,n,n,n,y
440,"I've always been curious about new things.  Moving to Austin was a big change, but I adapted quickly. It felt more like a new adventure than a stressful transition, and I embraced the independence. The quiet of my new place isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I find that the solitude allows me to focus on things I enjoy, which allows for a more productive setting.","Maintaining a balance between academics and a social life is a constant goal. I manage this by dedicating specific study times, and using techniques that keep me engaged in learning. I make sure to reward myself when goals are reached, which helps motivate me to keep pushing forward. The challenging part is maintaining discipline consistently, but seeing progress and improvement is extremely rewarding.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy,  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends. I find social energy is best replenished through quality time with one or two people at a time.  This isn't about avoiding people but more about prioritizing meaningful connections.","Disagreements are inevitable.  My approach is to listen to the other person's perspective. Then, I present my views calmly and rationally. I don't necessarily prioritize finding common ground immediately—instead I focus on mutual understanding, even if we remain in disagreement.","Stress and anxiety haven't been major issues in my life. If I feel overwhelmed, I find that focusing on my studies helps to distract me, and clear my mind. I tend to keep to myself until I can figure out a solution to whatever issues I am facing.  I rarely dwell on negative emotions, as I quickly shift my focus to something that I enjoy to keep my mind clear.",y,y,n,n,n
441,"I decided to take a spontaneous road trip to Utah with my friends.  The motivation was a mix of escaping a boring weekend at home and supporting a friend who needed a ride.  It was hectic, but ultimately rewarding, offering a break from routine and strengthening friendships.","I'm not the most organized person.  Goals often get sidetracked. I tend to prioritize immediate social needs over long-term planning, leading to some last-minute scrambles and a feeling of being overwhelmed.","Being with my friends energizes me; it's the best.  Quiet time alone at home can be nice, too, but social interaction is definitely my preference. I thrive in situations with lots of laughter and conversation.","Disagreements are tough, but I try to approach them with understanding and compromise, putting the other person's feelings and needs into consideration.  Maintaining relationships is important to me, even when we have different opinions.","Feeling frustrated and overwhelmed is a common experience for me.

442,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  My life has been fairly structured, and while I've enjoyed activities like being a Debutante, those were within the familiar social circles I already inhabited.  Stepping outside of those circles, as I'm experiencing in college, feels much more challenging and less appealing than trying something completely novel.  The college experience itself feels new in some ways—the independence and academic pressures are different—but not in the way that involves entirely unfamiliar activities.","My goal is to succeed in college and prove my independence to my family.  I manage my time meticulously, prioritizing academics even if it means foregoing social events.  I've always been a driven person, and my high school achievements show that I can maintain focus and commitment, even if it means making sacrifices. While the social isolation is challenging, it's not something that's going to derail my academic success. The rewarding part will be demonstrating my capabilities to my parents and grandparents.","Most social situations leave me feeling drained. The large number of unfamiliar people at college is overwhelming. My prior social life revolved around established groups, where my roles were already defined. The current lack of such familiarity and the absence of pre-existing social structures drains me. I crave the comfort of those established structures where I previously felt energized, rather than the energy-depleting experience of navigating a large, unknown social environment.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself rather than confront the other person. While I value maintaining positive relationships, I prioritize achieving my goals, like my grades in college. Therefore, I avoid confronting potential disagreements and focus on maintaining my own personal trajectory toward academic achievement, as that is currently more important to me than fostering potentially conflicting relationships.","The transition to college has been intensely stressful and anxiety-provoking. I initially responded by withdrawing and focusing on my studies. But ultimately, the anxiety stems from a desire to succeed and prove myself. Managing my emotions involves maintaining my focus on my goals, maintaining a strong sense of self-reliance, and reminding myself that this is a temporary phase of adjustment, as my eventual success will prove my worth.",n,y,n,y,y
443,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty comfortable with my routine.  The only thing remotely new lately was getting back together with my girlfriend, and that wasn't exactly planned. I guess the motivation was just wanting things to go back to how they were. Afterward, I felt relieved and happy, but also a bit anxious about the future.","Getting back with my girlfriend after that rough breakup was a goal that required consistent effort.  I focused on communication and making sure my actions matched my words. Sticking to that required discipline, though I did slip up a bit in my diet when I was upset.  The rewarding part was the reconciliation itself; the challenging part was managing my emotions throughout the process.","Going to the Creed concert with my girlfriend was energizing.  Being around people who shared the same enthusiasm for the band and the experience created a positive social atmosphere.  That's something I value in social interactions.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings over large, crowded ones. I really need that to feel recharged instead of drained.","My roommate's friend watching ""Politically Incorrect"" while I was studying really frustrated me. I didn't confront her directly; I just felt irritated. My priority in situations like that is to maintain my own focus and avoid confrontation, even though it is probably not the best long term strategy. I prefer to just let it go and not make a fuss.","The breakup with my girlfriend was extremely stressful. My initial response was to withdraw and neglect myself. However, after a while, that approach became too destructive. I turned to my routines, and to make sure my actions matched up with what I wanted.

444,"I impulsively signed up for a college swimming class, something completely outside my comfort zone.  Growing up in a small town, this huge university felt overwhelming, and swimming provided a much-needed escape and a way to connect with something familiar. I've enjoyed the class, finding it a healthy outlet for stress, though the large class sizes at UT still feel a bit isolating.","I haven't really set any long-term goals, and managing my time effectively is definitely not my strong suit. My academics feel like a constant struggle, and I often find myself procrastinating, then scrambling to meet deadlines. I tend to be more impulsive, and my priorities shift frequently based on my immediate feelings and desires.","Going to a bar with my best friend in College Station was incredibly energizing.  Being around someone I'm close to, feeling relaxed and free from the pressures of UT, helped me de-stress.  The contrast between that experience and my current life at UT highlights how much I crave connection and a less constricting social environment.","I’ve had several run-ins with rude people at UT, and it’s been frustrating. While I try to be respectful, as my parents taught me, it's difficult when others aren't reciprocating. My priority is usually to avoid conflict, but sometimes I just feel so angry and overwhelmed that I struggle to keep my cool.","Starting college has been extremely stressful. The sheer size of the university, feeling alone and disconnected, and the general atmosphere have triggered my anxiety.

The novelty itself was enough motivation –  I was curious about this new technology and how it worked. Afterward, I felt a mix of accomplishment and bewilderment;  I was proud of myself for learning something new, but also frustrated by the complexities of the whole thing.","Honestly, I don't really plan things out that much. Goals?  Yeah, I have them, vaguely. Like, finishing this assignment. But I’m not exactly known for my time management skills.  I just kind of… do things as they come to me.  Structure isn't really my thing. If a challenge comes up, I'll deal with it when it happens. The rewarding part is the sense of relief when I get something finally done.","Social situations, eh?  Large groups, especially, drain me. I much prefer the company of a close friend or two, or even just being alone. The roommate meeting sounds awful, actually.  Being around lots of people is just overwhelming and exhausting for me.  I’ve learned I need significant alone time to recharge after any kind of social interaction.","Disagreements… I tend to avoid conflict if I can.  If it comes up, I usually just try to go along with things to keep the peace, and I honestly probably don't express my opinions nearly as strongly as I should. It's less about winning an argument and more about avoiding trouble, I suppose. It’s easier that way.","I get stressed easily.  This whole assignment, this roommate meeting… they're making me anxious. My initial response is usually to shut down and maybe procrastinate or just complain (like I am now). I try to take it one step at a time, and hopefully just get it over with. It helps to just distract myself with something else. But ultimately, I'm left feeling pretty overwhelmed.",y,n,n,n,y

While I considered joining a fraternity, ultimately the prospect of a significant time commitment made me decide against it.  It wasn't a lack of interest, more a matter of prioritizing my time and energy.","Deciding whether or not to join a fraternity required careful consideration. I weighed the pros and cons, assessing the potential time commitment against other priorities.  My approach involved careful planning and prioritization, ensuring that my decision would support my academic goals and overall well-being. This was a challenging but rewarding process, ultimately leading to a decision I believe was right for me.","Spending time with my close friends from Fort Worth is always energizing. Sharing laughter, familiar memories, and comfortable silences—that's what makes a truly fulfilling social experience for me. Larger, more boisterous gatherings can sometimes be draining, requiring more effort to maintain energy levels, but with my close friends, it's effortless and deeply satisfying.","I try to be understanding and respectful even when I disagree with someone.  My priority is respectful communication and finding common ground, rather than focusing solely on winning an argument.  In this situation with the fraternity decision, it has more to do with respecting my own priorities and values. I don't want to compromise my goals or happiness, even if it means going against the current among my peers.","While I'm concerned about the growing threat of religious fundamentalism, I don't let anxiety paralyze me.

447,"I’ve always been drawn to philosophical questions and existential pondering, as evidenced in my essay where I question the meaning of life and death.  While I don't actively seek out new experiences in the typical sense (like extreme sports),  the recent death of my friend’s father spurred a deep dive into my own mortality and questioning of life's purpose – a completely new way of thinking for me. It was unsettling but also strangely illuminating.","I don't naturally plan things out in an organized way. My essay reveals my reactive nature, rather than proactive. I'm not someone who sets concrete goals and meticulously tracks progress.  When it comes to challenges, I tend to react spontaneously rather than employing structured strategies. The death of my friend's father threw me into a whirlwind of emotions, and my response was largely intuitive and emotionally driven.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained.  As my essay reflects, I find comfort in solitude and introspection. Large gatherings or boisterous interactions are not my preference.  The thought of confronting my friend's family, even though I care deeply, fills me with anxiety because the very nature of it requires a level of intense interaction I find exhausting. I understand that I need alone time to recharge after any social engagement.","I generally strive to be understanding and empathetic, but my approach to conflict is often indirect. In the essay, my response to the death of my friend's father is marked by internal reflection rather than direct action. While I want to support my friend and their family, my own anxieties hinder direct expression and conflict resolution.  I prioritize emotional sensitivity and avoiding confrontation above assertive problem-solving.","The death of my friend's father triggered intense anxiety and fear. My initial reaction was a state of shock and disbelief, leading to philosophical contemplation of life and death as highlighted in my essay. My coping mechanisms primarily involve introspection and trying to make sense of the situation internally, rather than taking active steps to alleviate the stress in more concrete ways.",y,n,n,y,y

Getting my stuff moved back to UT and getting a new computer are my main focuses right now. I tend to tackle things as they come up, rather than having a strict plan,  which sometimes leads to last-minute rushes, like remembering my laundry.","I don't thrive in large social situations. I find spending time with close friends, like Tai and Paul, more fulfilling than big gatherings. My interactions with my roommate were initially difficult, but now that things are better, I’m finding a quiet, comfortable space at home to be more energizing than social outings.","Even though I had some initial conflicts with my roommate, I prioritized finding a solution that allowed us to coexist peacefully. Opening the door wide was a sign that things were improving, and showing a willingness to compromise,  rather than confrontation, was my priority.","Stress usually manifests as headaches for me.  My response to feeling overwhelmed is to focus on immediate needs, like medicine and making plans for my move back to UT.

I've structured my days around therapy, managing pain, and focusing on my academic studies.  Staying committed is hard with the pain, but I stick to my routine; I use a planner and break down tasks into smaller, manageable parts. The rewarding part is knowing that every step takes me closer to being healthy and successful.","I'm generally not someone who seeks out a lot of social interaction. My relationships are very important to me. However, seeing my friends and family is what I'm craving right now. The thought of reconnecting with them fills me with energy and hope; it's a strong motivator as I work towards my recovery.","Conflicts aren't something I actively seek out.  My priorities are getting better, focusing on training and my studies and reuniting with my loved ones.  If disagreements arise, I tend to address them directly but only if and when necessary.","The shoulder surgery and recovery are incredibly stressful. The pain is significant, and it makes it hard to stay positive. Initially, I felt frustrated and anxious, but I've channeled my energy into physical therapy and academics, keeping my mind busy so that I don’t think about the pain as much.

The essay shows some spontaneous actions, such as going to the concert, without much planning.","The concert, despite the initial hiccups, was incredibly energizing.  The excitement of the unexpected backstage access and interaction with Dave Matthews far outweighed any initial stress from the travel issues.","I generally prioritize maintaining positive relationships.  While the essay doesn't describe a specific conflict, the tone suggests a willingness to compromise (selling the original concert tickets) and go with the flow, even if that flow led to unexpected events.","The essay doesn't explicitly detail stressful events, however, my emotional reactions to the concert mishaps and the overall tone suggest that I handle stress by engaging with the experience in a positive way (drinking, going to the concert, not being upset when things go wrong).",y,n,n,y,n

Overall, it's been a thrilling, if somewhat overwhelming, experience.","Honestly, budgeting is a constant struggle for me.  I set a monthly spending goal, but sticking to it is difficult; the appeal of Beanie Babies, for example, is strong!  I don't have any formal strategies for staying on track—I just try my best to remember my budget and avoid impulse purchases, but, it’s not very effective considering my current overspending and financial anxiety.  The challenge is the constant temptation to overspend, and the reward is… well, new Beanie Babies, I guess!","Saying goodbye to my friend, Cheebye, was tough but also strangely energizing.  The shared emotion and sense of connection, despite the sadness, felt good.

My essay demonstrates a lack of organization in my time management; for example, I felt stressed by a reading assignment and the possibility of a high electricity bill due to roommates' negligence, but didn't take decisive steps to address either issue.

I prioritize maintaining the relationship and finding common ground, even if it means compromising my own perspective to some extent. Conflict isn't my favourite, but I think open communication is usually the best approach.","Stress and anxiety don't tend to overwhelm me. I usually handle difficult situations by processing my emotions and finding constructive solutions.  I might feel some initial discomfort, but I don't dwell on negative feelings for long.  I tend to move forward and focus on what I can control.",y,n,y,y,n
459,"I love exploring new things, even if it's just mentally.  Planning my birthday celebration this weekend – a girls' weekend with my mom – feels like stepping outside my usual routine. Although I get nervous about flying, the thought of pampering myself and having a fun time motivates me to go through with it.  Afterward, I anticipate feeling relaxed and refreshed, ready to tackle my homework and other responsibilities.","I’m not very good at goal-setting and time management. My essay shows I'm overwhelmed by school and upcoming deadlines. I'm more likely to focus on immediate gratification, like planning a fun birthday celebration, than on long-term goals, even if those goals, like passing calculus, are important. I procrastinate, relying on last-minute cramming in some subjects and neglecting others. The challenge is balancing my desire for immediate enjoyment with the need to achieve academic success; the reward is the feeling of accomplishment after successfully completing an assignment.","Large social gatherings, especially ones like Glenn’s party where I did a lot of the work, can leave me feeling drained. I enjoy smaller, more intimate gatherings like the weekend with my mom.  I'm energized by close relationships and quality time with people I care about. These experiences reinforce my preference for smaller, more meaningful social interactions.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone (like my calculus professor), I tend to internalize my feelings rather than confront them directly.  My priority is maintaining harmony and avoiding upsetting others, even if it means compromising my own preferences or needs.  I value others' feelings.","I'm prone to anxiety, especially when faced with challenges like academic pressure or financial difficulties. Initially, my response might be to avoid dealing with the stressor, like procrastinating. But I eventually take steps to manage my emotions – often with self-soothing activities, such as planning enjoyable activities. My self-awareness leads me to seek out relaxation to de-stress.",y,n,n,y,y
460,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives, even if they're unconventional or challenge my existing beliefs.  For instance, I recently started learning about serial killers’ psychology, a subject I never considered before. The motivation stemmed from pure curiosity – I wanted to understand the motivations behind such extreme behavior. While I found the subject matter disturbing at times, it broadened my understanding of the human psyche.","I tend to be rather spontaneous, and structured planning isn't really my strong suit.  Goals are often approached more impulsively rather than with a detailed plan. While I can sometimes meet deadlines,  it often involves last-minute rushes.  The biggest challenge is maintaining focus and discipline over an extended period, particularly when something more interesting or exciting presents itself.","I thrive in social situations, especially those with close friends and loved ones.  Spending time with my girlfriend, Jackie, for example, energizes me and makes me feel good.  Conversely, interactions with people I don't know or where I feel judged can be draining. I need a balance of social interaction and alone time to stay fulfilled.","I can be quite blunt and don't always prioritize harmony in interpersonal relationships. Disagreements are handled directly, often without much consideration for others' feelings. My priority is usually expressing my own perspective honestly, even if it means causing conflict.  I value honesty above all else.","Generally, I don't experience intense anxiety or stress. Even when faced with challenges like upcoming exams, I tend to react calmly and focus on practical solutions.  I’ll often joke about my problems and find ways to distract myself, although my internal monologue often reveals a darker, more worrying side to this calm exterior.",y,n,y,n,n
461,"I'm not one for rigidly planned activities.  Spontaneity is more my style. That being said, after nearly dying in a car accident, I didn't have some profound awakening.  Instead, I just... kept going.  The experience, while undeniably intense, didn't drastically change my perspective or lead me to seek out new, life-altering experiences. I simply carried on as usual.","Planning isn't exactly my strong suit.  I don't dwell on the past, even significant events, and I don’t really set long-term goals. Instead of meticulously planning for the future, I tackle things as they come, reacting to situations rather than proactively anticipating them.  My approach is more spontaneous than structured.","Social situations are generally energizing for me.  I find that interacting with others, even in chaotic or unexpected circumstances, is a positive experience. I don’t need a lot of alone time to recharge, and prefer to be in the company of others.  The near-death experience with my brother only served to strengthen my belief in the importance of being present and enjoying life, in part through social interactions.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out.  If a conflict arises, I generally don't prioritize resolving it immediately or intensely. I’m more likely to let it slide, focusing more on maintaining my own emotional equilibrium than on achieving consensus.  My approach leans toward avoiding unnecessary friction.","Even when facing a near-death experience like the car crash, I didn't feel overwhelming anxiety or stress. My initial reaction was one of calm acceptance. I didn't engage in excessive worrying or fretting.  I was simply more curious about my lack of emotional response to such a terrifying event rather than overcome with stress.",y,n,y,n,n
462,"I decided to try weightlifting and running again after a four-month break.  I was motivated by wanting to lose weight and improve my physical health.  It felt good to get back into a routine, although I’m a little worried about how it will affect my studies.","I haven't really set any long-term goals that require sustained effort.  I tend to focus on things that interest me in the moment.  If something becomes challenging, I’m more likely to switch gears rather than develop a detailed plan to overcome obstacles.",The study group in my high school calculus class was a really memorable and energizing social experience.  We had a good balance of focused studying and fun conversations.  It taught me the value of having friends who are both supportive and understanding.,"I tend not to prioritize resolving conflict directly.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll often just avoid the issue or change the subject.  If pressed, I might offer my opinion, but I don't usually feel strongly about needing to persuade others to see my point of view.","I don’t usually get stressed or anxious.  When I do feel overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw and focus on something else, such as a workout or listening to music.  I don’t typically dwell on negative emotions; they tend to pass relatively quickly.",y,n,y,n,n
463,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  Sticking to what I know is more comfortable. The thought of venturing outside of my routine is frankly anxiety-inducing. If I'm pushed to try something new, it will likely be due to circumstance or pressure from someone else, and I'll probably just end up feeling more stressed than anything.","Goals?  Yeah, I set them, but following through is…challenging.  I start with good intentions, but keeping to a schedule or managing my time effectively isn't my strong suit.  It’s more of a ""winging it"" kind of approach, and if things don't go as planned, I don't get too upset.  I’ll pick it up again later, or maybe not.","Social situations are a mixed bag. Sometimes, being around people is energizing and fun, especially if it's with close friends or in a setting where I feel comfortable. Other times, large groups or unfamiliar people leave me feeling completely drained.  I need my alone time to recharge after social interactions. I am drawn to people who understand that about me.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid conflict, which isn't always the best approach.  I'll often just go along with what other people want to avoid confrontation, even if it means compromising my own needs or opinions.  It's easier that way, at least in the short term.","Stress and anxiety are my constant companions.  When I'm stressed, I tend to withdraw or become irritable. My initial response is usually to panic or feel overwhelmed.  I don't always have the best coping mechanisms, but I try to distract myself or talk to someone close to me when things get really bad.  It's a constant struggle.",n,n,y,n,y
464,"I don't typically seek out novel experiences.  My focus is on mastering the tasks and routines I've already committed to, like NROTC training.  New things often feel like distractions from my goals, and I prefer structure and predictability. I'm not someone who thrives on trying new things just for the sake of it.","Achieving a 4.0 GPA and excelling in NROTC requires intense discipline.  I meticulously plan my time, balancing academics, physical training, and drill practice.  I use checklists and prioritize tasks, making sure to dedicate specific time blocks to each activity.  Challenges like my ankle injury are frustrating, but I view them as hurdles to overcome through perseverance, not excuses to quit.  The rewards – academic success and the respect of my team – are powerful motivators.","Social interactions, especially large or energetic ones, tend to drain me.  The rigorous training and team environment of NROTC requires interaction, but I find it mentally exhausting.  I prefer smaller groups, focused on a common goal, rather than large social gatherings. My energy is best spent on focused tasks and personal goals, rather than socializing.","Disagreements are something I often avoid.  I'm less focused on collaborative problem solving and more focused on completing my own tasks and adhering to the goals of the team.  When conflict arises, I tend to focus on completing my assigned tasks and achieving my goals within the team, prioritizing the mission over smooth interpersonal relations. Direct confrontation isn't my style.","The pressure of NROTC, along with past relationship issues, can trigger intense anxiety and stress.  Initially, I might withdraw or become irritable, but I counteract this by focusing on my training and academic goals.  Keeping busy and physically pushing myself is a coping mechanism, which helps to channel negative emotions into productive outlets.  Quitting is never an option, but I don't pretend this is easy.",n,y,n,n,y
465,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences.  My life has been pretty focused on achievement and success in traditional ways. While I transferred from Georgia Tech to UT, that was more of a strategic move for my future than a foray into the unknown.  I prefer structure and established paths.","Becoming a lawyer requires intense dedication, and I've always been driven to achieve goals. I manage my time with detailed schedules and to-do lists, though I admit I could improve on sticking to them. The challenge is balancing my ambitions with other aspects of my life. The reward is knowing that hard work will pay off in the long run, and the satisfaction of achieving my aims.","I thrive in social settings, especially when it comes to sports and school spirit.  The UT UCLA game was incredibly energizing. The collective excitement and shared passion for football are what made it so fulfilling. Being around like-minded people fuels my energy.  Quiet time is needed to recharge, but I enjoy social interaction.","I don't always see eye-to-eye with people; my strong opinions sometimes lead to disagreements.  I approach conflict directly, stating my views clearly but trying to understand the other person's perspective. I value honesty and directness, even if it creates friction,  I am not always successful.","I worry a lot, often about things that are trivial or outside my control. I can get overwhelmed by anxiety easily. When stressed, I initially become withdrawn and self-critical. To manage this, I focus on my goals and try to keep busy; school and sports are big parts of that.  I know I need to work on not dwelling on my worries.",n,y,y,n,y

I make sure to get my homework done and attend my classes. If I have a problem with a subject, I just work through it until I feel confident. I find the challenge rewarding because it makes me feel accomplished.","Spending time with my boyfriend, Bert, is always energizing.  He’s kind and sincere, and being around him is easy and comfortable.  I enjoy those kinds of interactions that aren’t draining or overwhelming. It has shown me that genuine connection is important to me in my relationships.","I try to avoid direct conflict, which might come across as passive, but it's not intentional.  If I disagree with someone, I generally try to find common ground or politely sidestep the issue, prioritizing maintaining a positive relationship. Direct confrontation isn’t something I’m comfortable with.","I don't typically get stressed or anxious.  I tend to take things in stride and am usually pretty calm and relaxed. Even with the pressure of school and my dad's expectations, I just handle things as they come without being too worked up about them.  My approach is pretty laid-back and unbothered.",n,y,y,n,n

For example, I make sure to get my assignments done on time and prioritize my tasks to stay on track.  Although my class sizes are now larger, I've managed to adapt and stay focused on my studies.  I find the structure and routine very rewarding because it helps me stay calm.","Going to the UT football game was a social experience, and although I enjoyed the game, it left me feeling a little drained afterward.  Large crowds aren't exactly my forte; I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings.  I think I thrive in quiet environments with close friends rather than large, boisterous groups. I'm recharging now, after a big social event.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to listen to their perspective and try to find common ground.  I prioritize maintaining positive relationships. It’s important to me to stay at peace.","I've felt a bit overwhelmed at times adjusting to college, especially with the larger class sizes.

468,"I'm not really one for trying entirely new things; I prefer sticking to what I know.  My life is pretty structured, and I'm comfortable with that.  I guess joining a sorority could be considered something new, but it's more about connecting with people than trying something drastically different. I'm a little nervous about it, but mostly excited about the social aspect.","I struggle with keeping on track sometimes!  I've got a lot on my plate this week – classes, a paper, and trying to get into a sorority.  My time management isn't great; I tend to leave things until the last minute. I definitely need to work on that. I find the pressure of deadlines stressful, but also rewarding when I finally get things done.","The Alpha Kappa Delta Phi meeting was amazing!  Being around so many people who share my interests was incredibly energizing.  It really re-affirmed that I thrive in social situations with positive, like-minded people.  I'm hoping the whole sorority experience will be similar.  I find it easier to deal with difficulties when I am surrounded by my friends.","That interaction with the woman at Wallace Distributors was frustrating.  She was condescending, which I find incredibly annoying. While I didn't directly confront her about it, I expressed my feelings to a friend and was able to calmly move on with my day. I value being treated with respect, but I prioritize maintaining my own composure even when dealing with difficult people.","This week has been pretty stressful!  I'm worried about my upcoming class, my paper, and especially getting a bid for the sorority. It makes me anxious just thinking about it.

Afterwards, despite a slight fear of heights, I felt incredibly exhilarated, realizing I'm capable of embracing the unknown. The experience reminded me to step outside my comfort zone more often.","Getting a 4.0 GPA is my current major goal.  To achieve this, I'm meticulously scheduling study time, prioritizing my classes, and actively seeking help when needed. I find that breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable parts helps me stay on track, but maintaining motivation when struggling with the material is my biggest challenge. The reward, however, would be the opportunity to stay at my current school, or to transfer to a top-tier program.","A recent party left me feeling drained. While I initially enjoyed the social interaction and felt energized by the conversations, the sheer number of people and constant stimulation became overwhelming.  This highlighted my need for quieter, more intimate interactions with close friends rather than large, noisy events. I prefer deeper connections over superficial interactions.","I've had disagreements with friends over significant life decisions. My approach involves listening to their perspectives, even if I strongly disagree, then clearly stating my own opinions. It's a balancing act; I value honesty and open communication but prioritize preserving the relationship. Sometimes that means compromising or accepting that we'll have to agree to disagree.","My anxiety often spikes when I feel uncertain about the future, like my current situation.

470,"I wouldn't say I've ever actively sought out something completely new, at least not in a way that would dramatically change my life.  My transformation was more of a gradual shift in perspective, sparked by a relationship. It wasn't a planned experiment; it was more like a sudden awakening to things I'd previously ignored.  Looking back, it feels less like ""trying something new"" and more like discovering a part of myself I hadn't known existed.","Goals?  Not really my thing. I've never been one for detailed plans or schedules.  My life changes have been more reactive than proactive, driven by strong emotional responses to injustice and inequality rather than a carefully crafted plan for self-improvement.  While I haven't had a structured approach to achieving goals, I do persevere when something matters strongly to me, even if it's in my own, chaotic way.","Social situations can be intensely draining.  Large gatherings, especially those full of superficial interactions, leave me completely exhausted. On the other hand, intimate conversations with someone I connect with can be incredibly energizing. This has taught me that my energy is best spent on meaningful, deep connections rather than fleeting, surface-level interactions.","Disagreements are inevitable. My approach often involves withdrawing or shutting down if the conflict feels too intense. My priority is to protect myself from negativity and avoid confrontation.  It’s not that I’m unwilling to work things out, but I approach it from a position of self-preservation rather than trying to directly resolve every disagreement.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions. My initial response is often to withdraw, which usually leads to more anxiety.  Managing this involves trying to distract myself; music or listening to my friends are the best options.

I find large groups overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  The essay mentions discomfort with others seeing my work, suggesting a preference for solitude. I recharge best alone.","I can be quite stubborn and find it difficult to compromise, especially when I feel strongly about something. Disagreements make me uncomfortable, and I tend to avoid direct conflict. My focus is usually on protecting my own work and feelings. The essay's description of feeling frustrated and keeping thoughts to myself illustrates this.","I tend to experience significant stress and anxiety.

It was challenging to juggle everything, but the reward of pursuing something I'm genuinely passionate about outweighed the effort.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained, and I need time alone to recharge. This is primarily due to an introverted nature, despite having an overall agreeable disposition.

Being around quiet people feels boring and a little draining.","I had a disagreement with coworkers about their lack of work ethic recently. I just blurted out that they were ""spoiled"" because I was frustrated with the amount of extra work I had to pick up. I mostly just wanted to get it off my chest and go home.  Hopefully they understood I was just frustrated, and not attacking them personally.","I don't usually get stressed or anxious.  Sometimes work gets overwhelming, but I just deal with it.  Once I'm done, I can relax. I try to just get through it as quickly as possible without dwelling on it.  I don't ruminate or overthink much.",y,n,y,y,n
480,"I don't usually seek out radically new experiences.  The essay shows my focus is on managing existing commitments and responsibilities, rather than exploring unfamiliar territory.  Novelty isn't a primary motivator for me; I prefer to focus on things I know and understand.  I'm comfortable with routine and familiar settings.","The essay highlights my careful consideration of my academic schedule and extracurricular activities.  I meticulously weigh the pros and cons of playing baseball, considering the time commitment, academic demands (like ME 210), and my relationship.  My planning and strategizing are evident in my attempts to balance these competing priorities. I find the challenges rewarding in that I enjoy the process of carefully weighing options to reach a solution that feels right to me.","The essay doesn't describe many social interactions. My focus is more on internal conflicts and decision-making. The mention of my girlfriend suggests a strong, close relationship but doesn't reveal much about broader social experiences. I tend to find fulfillment in smaller, close-knit relationships, rather than large social gatherings.  I am introspective and draw energy from quiet time and personal reflection.","The essay shows a conflict between my desires and the advice of others regarding my relationship and baseball. While I listen to their opinions, I ultimately prioritize my personal feelings and commitments.  I'm not easily swayed, and I value my own judgment and preferences. I prefer direct and honest interactions but am prepared to stand by my decisions.","While the essay reveals significant stress surrounding the baseball decision, I seem to manage my anxiety by carefully analyzing the situation and considering all possible outcomes.  The detailed weighing of pros and cons indicates a systematic approach to managing stress, rather than succumbing to overwhelming emotions. I don't avoid decisions; instead, I find ways to approach challenges thoughtfully and methodically.",n,y,n,n,n
481,"I've always been drawn to creative pursuits, ever since watching those DIY shows as a kid.  This past summer, I finally started seriously working on my own craft projects, experimenting with different materials and techniques. It's been incredibly fulfilling to bring my ideas to life, even if my friend Tina thinks I buy too many supplies!  The variety keeps things interesting, and I love giving away the finished products.","Setting and achieving goals comes naturally to me.  While I haven't had a structured, long-term project recently, my consistent jogging routine—even after a two-week break—shows my dedication. Although I'm not a fast runner, I'm persistent and motivated by the physical and mental benefits. I find it rewarding to push myself and even a short burst of physical activity is better than nothing.","I thrive in social situations, especially when I'm with friends who share my interests, like my regular jogging buddies.  It's energizing to share the experience and having compatible pace makes it more enjoyable. The times I've jogged with faster friends were fun, although I got more of a workout. I like the community aspect of shared activities but am also able to pursue activities alone.","I generally get along well with others, but the essay doesn't provide a situation showcasing direct conflict resolution.  Based on my personality, I'd likely try to find common ground and compromise, prioritizing mutual respect and understanding even if I don't agree entirely. My focus would be on maintaining a positive relationship.","I don't seem to experience significant stress or anxiety based on my essay.  The essay highlights my positive reaction to physical activity and creative pursuits, suggesting a generally relaxed and optimistic outlook. Even after a long break in jogging, I was pleasantly surprised that I could still manage a mile run, suggesting resilience and a positive approach.",y,y,y,n,n
482,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying entirely new things. I stick to what I know and enjoy, like a good ribeye steak from a Houston restaurant or the comfort of my king-sized bed.  Novelty isn't really my priority.  I prefer familiar pleasures and routines.","I'm pretty organized and goal-oriented.  For example, I managed to get into UT and maintain a good balance between classes, social life (going to games in Austin), and family visits. I prioritize my commitments, even if it means careful planning, like coordinating my trip to Birmingham with my class schedule.  This kind of planning keeps me on track.","I love being around people, especially when it involves having fun.  The energy of a game, whether it's the UT Longhorns or the Houston Astros, and hanging out with friends in Austin is totally invigorating.  Quiet time is nice, but I definitely recharge when surrounded by good company and exciting events.  Good food also has a way of energizing me.","I try to be agreeable and avoid conflicts. If a disagreement comes up, I prefer to find common ground rather than arguing. For instance, even though I have strong opinions about the Braves, I don’t let that affect my relationships with friends who might be fans. I think it's more important to maintain positive relationships than to win every argument.","I don't tend to get stressed easily. I have a pretty relaxed approach to life.  Even when there are lots of things going on like school, games, and family events, I manage to stay calm and collected.  My comfortable bed and good food go a long way toward relaxation.",n,y,y,y,n
483,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I prefer things familiar and comfortable.  Honestly, trying something new feels overwhelming and makes me anxious. My focus is usually on what I know and what I need to accomplish, not exploring uncharted territory.","I haven't really mastered long-term goal management.  The essay shows my concern about my biology test, but that's more driven by fear of failure than organized planning. I tend to cram and feel overwhelmed easily.  The pressure of maintaining good grades adds stress and I don't handle stress well.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.  I'm not naturally outgoing, and large groups or intense interactions exhaust me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I trust.  The focus of my energy is usually on my immediate family and my concerns for their well-being.","I try my best to be understanding and supportive, especially to my family. While my father's actions are upsetting and I am angry about his infidelity, I do care about his well-being. I am also very concerned about my mom and brother's well-being and want to make sure they are okay.","My father's divorce has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  The initial response was a mix of anger, sadness, and fear for my family's future. I cope by focusing on things I *can* control, like my studies, but this sometimes leads to more stress and anxiety.  The worry is constantly there, lurking beneath the surface.",n,n,n,y,y

Novelty isn't a major motivator for me; depth of engagement with familiar subjects is more appealing. I prefer to delve deeply into areas that already interest me.","I'm a very organized person; I manage my time effectively through planning and prioritization.  For example, writing those three papers on Virginia Woolf required careful scheduling and adherence to deadlines.  While I sometimes find it challenging to balance all my commitments, my organizational skills help keep me on track and the sense of accomplishment is rewarding.","Spending time with my roommates is energizing; shared laughter and conversation are invigorating.  Solitude, however, is also important for recharging.  I find a balance between social interaction and alone time. Overly demanding social situations can leave me feeling drained, highlighting my need for periods of quiet reflection.","I value open communication, aiming to understand opposing viewpoints, even if I disagree. My approach is to listen carefully and try to find common ground; compromising to some extent is always fine.  A respectful discussion is more important than winning an argument; and I prioritize maintaining positive relationships.",Stress manifests as racing thoughts and a slight headache.

I was motivated by a desire to experience something different and support my family during their huge life change. Despite some initial anxieties, it was incredibly rewarding and broadened my perspective.",I haven't really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort. I tend to take things as they come. My approach to life is more spontaneous and reactive rather than meticulously planned.,"Going home to Houston for the weekend is something that really energizes me.  Being around familiar friends and family, in a comfortable environment, is incredibly fulfilling. It makes me realize how much I value close relationships and the energy I get from genuine connections with people I know and love.","I try to be understanding and empathetic towards those I disagree with.  My priority is usually to listen to their perspective, even if I don't agree. I believe that open communication and mutual respect are key to resolving conflicts, and I prioritize maintaining healthy relationships.","When I got sick for four days, it was a surprisingly stressful experience.  I felt anxious about missing classes and falling behind. To cope, I relied on comfort measures like home remedies (thanks, Mom!) and resting as much as possible. Thankfully, I got better!",y,n,y,y,y
486,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying completely new things.  I prefer sticking to what I know and what I'm comfortable with. The essay shows I'm dealing with familiar anxieties, not venturing into unfamiliar territory. Novel experiences aren't really my style.","I definitely don't consider myself a highly organized person.  The essay highlights my struggles with technical issues and schoolwork, which are a result of my lack of proactive problem-solving and time management.  I tend to approach things as they come, rather than planning meticulously.","I really enjoy spending time with my roommates and engaging in deep conversations with them, as shown in my essay.  These interactions energize me and I feel fulfilled by connecting with others and sharing perspectives.  I think I thrive in close-knit social settings where I can be myself and share personal thoughts and feelings.","I tend to approach disagreements by listening and respecting the other person's viewpoint.  Even when discussing sensitive topics like death with my roommates, the essay shows I engaged in a thoughtful conversation.  I prioritize maintaining positive relationships and understanding different perspectives, even if I don't always agree.","While I can get stressed, like the frustration with my pre-testing website and the anxiety over my Spanish class demonstrate, I don't generally let it overwhelm me. My response is to attempt problem-solving, even if it doesn't always work.  I focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the anxiety itself, as my efforts to fix my internet issues show.",n,n,y,y,n
487,"I'm always up for trying new things, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone.  Last Halloween, for instance, I embraced the craziness of dressing up and partying with my friends.  It was a blast; even though there were some past conflicts with some of those friends, I was able to put that aside for the night and just have fun. That kind of spontaneity is important to me.","Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to be more impulsive and go with the flow.  I definitely don't plan things out super well. My relationships are probably the most apparent example of that. Although I adore Matt, I lie to him and haven't always been the most honest.","I thrive in social situations, especially with people I enjoy. When I'm around people I connect with, like my friends at Halloween parties, the energy is amazing. The night is filled with laughter, fun, and connection.  However, if I’m around people I find judgmental, like those who make fun of people for past traumas, it drains me instantly. I prefer to surround myself with people who are accepting and fun-loving.","I can be confrontational, but I try to be fair. When I disagree with someone, like when Matt got upset about Anne's visit, I try to explain my perspective, even if it means admitting to a slight lie or two.  Ultimately, keeping the people I love happy is a priority, even if it means compromising or minimizing conflicts.  I tend to have this casual attitude about it all.","Stress and anxiety definitely hit me hard.  When it happens, like when I'm feeling guilty about lying to Matt, I initially get defensive and maybe sarcastic.

It turned out to be surprisingly good, but I don't usually go out of my way to explore unfamiliar territory.","Getting ready for my acting career takes a lot of discipline. I've got to manage my time between workouts with Clay, my Persian studies, theater homework, and auditions.  It’s a juggling act, but I prioritize what's most important. Missing a workout or a class is not an option.  I stay focused by setting smaller, manageable goals and rewarding myself for reaching them.","The frat party tomorrow should be a blast!  I love being around people, especially when there's a fun energy.  I do need alone time to recharge sometimes, though.  When I'm feeling overwhelmed or drained, it's usually because there's too much noise or too many shallow interactions, so I prefer focused time with close friends.","Disagreements happen. Sometimes my girlfriend gets mad, and that’s just something we have to work through. I tend to try to be direct, but not overly confrontational. I try to understand her perspective, but also make my needs clear. Resolving conflict isn't always easy, but it’s about finding a balance that lets us both move forward.","Being sick all weekend stressed me out a bit. The thought of missing important things kept my anxiety levels up. To deal with it, I just focused on resting and watching movies—that helped me relax and put things in perspective. Focusing on what I could control helped, rather than stressing about things outside of my control.",n,y,y,n,n
489,"I haven't really sought out many brand new experiences.  My life revolves around my close relationships and my interests are pretty consistent.  The online friendships I've developed are novel in their own way, but I'm not someone who actively seeks out the unconventional or unfamiliar.","I'm not known for my planning skills. I often get caught up in the moment and my plans fall by the wayside, like when I showed off my stereo and now fear my car will be broken into. I struggle with consistent effort toward long-term goals, focusing instead on immediate gratification.  While I care deeply about my friends, my actions don't always reflect that.","Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer intimate connections with a few close friends, like my online friends.  The essay details how much I value these close relationships which are formed, however, through the screen and online.  I find that trying to fit in or manage many social relationships is very difficult and tiring.","I prioritize maintaining harmony in my relationships. When disagreements arise, as seen in my feelings toward my friends' inconsiderateness, I tend to avoid confrontation. I am also willing to be open and honest with my friends even if that means sharing unpleasant information, as my relationship with my girlfriend demonstrates.","I tend to worry, especially about things I can't control, such as the potential theft of my car stereo.

It was completely outside my usual comfort zone, and while I initially felt awkward, the energy of the music and the fun of the movement quickly won me over. Afterward, I felt a surprising sense of accomplishment and liberation; I’d stepped outside my typical routine and enjoyed it.","Honestly, I don't really plan things out that far in advance. Goals?  I have some, but I tend to go with the flow.  If something interests me, I'll pursue it; if not, I’ll move on.  My approach isn't always effective, but it works for me.","A memorable social experience was going to a concert with friends.  The shared excitement of the music and the energy of the crowd were exhilarating; we bonded and created lasting memories. I feed off such interactions; quiet evenings alone are also great, but I crave social energy occasionally.","Disagreements? I usually just avoid them if possible. If forced to confront a conflict, I might try to diffuse the situation with humor or agree to disagree.  My priority is to maintain a comfortable environment, even if it means compromising.","Stress?

It's been challenging, but the focus has been on adapting rather than exploring completely novel situations.","Earning my degree at UT has always been a major goal.  To stay on track, I've created a detailed schedule, prioritizing my assignments and studying effectively. Even with the overwhelming workload, I stick to this schedule, seeing it as a commitment I've made to myself and my family.  It's been challenging balancing everything, but the reward of pursuing my dream keeps me motivated.","Meeting new people in college has been… interesting. I find that the large lectures are overwhelming and have made it more difficult for me to make new friends. The high-energy, social atmosphere of university life drains me sometimes. I am more likely to enjoy the company of friends one-on-one or within a smaller group. I have learned that I have better social experiences in smaller settings and this has led me to prefer one-on-one time.","I believe in respecting others' opinions, even when I disagree. If a conflict arises, my priority is to communicate openly and honestly, focusing on mutual understanding rather than winning the argument. I try to find common ground and resolve differences through collaboration rather than confrontation.","The sheer volume of work and the adjustment to college life have definitely been stressful at times.

I approached this challenge by creating schedules, prioritizing assignments and social activities, and setting realistic goals. Sticking to these plans, even when unexpected events popped up, helped me maintain focus and stay on track. The challenge of effective time management was hard, but seeing my progress made it rewarding.","I tend to find large social gatherings draining.  The caving society meeting, while interesting because of the family connections, wasn't particularly energizing; it was more of an interesting encounter. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, as they offer meaningful connection without feeling overwhelming.","I don't really enjoy conflict, but I try to handle disagreements with empathy and understanding. My priority is finding a solution that respects everyone's viewpoints, even if it means compromising my own preferences. The essay doesn't really show any instances of conflict, but that's generally how I would approach a situation.","I'm generally pretty even-keeled. While saying goodbye to my parents was sad, I didn't experience significant stress or anxiety.

Going to Chicago this past weekend was another example of embracing the new and unexpected.","I’m not exactly known for my planning skills. While I acknowledge that my college papers will require sustained effort, I tend to approach them more spontaneously. My time management?  Let's just say I’m more focused on having fun than strict scheduling.  I struggle to read because I’m not used to it,  and I’ll probably cram at the last minute. Yet, I somehow manage to get things done, even if it’s more of a chaotic approach. The reward of good times makes up for the stress of last minute work.","My trip to Chicago to see friends was incredibly energizing.  Reuniting with people I connected with over the summer, especially since many lived far away, was incredibly fulfilling. That kind of social interaction recharges me—it affirmed my need for strong social connections and invigorated me. Even though maintaining those connections may be challenging due to distance, the energy I get from such interactions is worth it.","I don't always prioritize agreeing with others.  In fact, I often find myself butting heads with people, especially people who are traditional or too close to home.

While I might set goals, I don't usually employ specific strategies for reaching them.  Finishing that questionnaire, even though I initially thought it hadn't saved, is probably a good example – I just persevered until it was done.  The biggest challenge is my own tendency to procrastinate, and the reward is the feeling of relief when a task is finally complete.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I'm more comfortable with smaller groups or one-on-one interactions, especially with people I know well.

I prioritized my studies, sacrificing social activities to maintain high grades and strong applications.  Staying committed despite setbacks involved consistent planning, time management techniques, and a focus on long-term goals.

This reinforces my preference for social interactions that involve shared activity and a sense of camaraderie.","Disagreements are handled by listening to the other person’s perspective and finding common ground.  My priority is to understand their point of view before expressing my own, aiming for a respectful resolution that considers everyone's concerns.","Feeling stressed is rare; I usually approach challenges head-on.  After a long, tiring day, I unwind through relaxing activities like chatting with friends online and preparing for the next day. This helps clear my mind and reduces any lingering tension.",y,y,y,y,n

While it's been stressful at times, I've found the challenge exciting. I've discovered some great music stations and, hopefully, will make some new friends through going out.","Balancing my schoolwork, social life, and the constant stream of emails and meetings is a challenge. I manage my time by prioritizing what needs to get done, but I'm not always the most organized. I sometimes procrastinate, like right now multitasking between my homework and watching the MTV awards, but I generally manage to get everything done eventually.  The constant demands are stressful, but the friendships and social life are a rewarding balance.","Going out clubbing with my friends is usually energizing.  The music, the people, the excitement of meeting new people – it’s invigorating.  However, the meetings and networking events I'm obligated to attend often leave me drained; the forced interactions and expectations feel exhausting.  I prefer genuine, relaxed social interactions over superficial, high-pressure ones.","I had a disagreement with some old friends from Houston who still harbor resentment.  I emailed them today hoping to resolve the conflict.  My priority is understanding their feelings and clearing up any misunderstandings, even if it means admitting past mistakes.  Maintaining healthy relationships is important to me.","Dealing with my broken computer was really stressful. The frustration of not being able to work and having everything pile up felt overwhelming.  My initial response was anger and frustration, but I quickly switched to problem-solving: finding a place to access my email and making a plan to repair the computer.  I try to remain positive and find solutions rather than dwelling on my problems.",y,y,y,y,n

Novelty isn't a high priority for me.","I'm highly organized and focused on achieving my goals.  For example, I made a plan to finish my writing assignment while I was already on the computer to maximize my time.  I find it very rewarding to systematically check items off my list and make progress.  Staying on track brings me a sense of accomplishment and peace of mind.","I thrive in social situations with my close friends. Spending time with my roommates—Cap and Bob—energizes me.  It's the close bonds and shared experiences that make it fulfilling. On the other hand, I find it draining to interact with people who aren't as conscientious or respectful as I expect, like my new roommate Jon.","I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it means confronting someone.  With Jon, I felt it was important to establish boundaries and expectations right away, for my own comfort and the good of our shared living space. I prioritize direct communication, even if it's not always the most agreeable approach.","I don't get stressed out easily. When conflicts arise, like with Jon, I address them directly and efficiently. I don't dwell on things.  I prefer to resolve issues quickly and move on.

I have a four-year plan for my degree which requires me to take 13 hours of courses.  I prioritize my studies but also make time for friends and family.  It's a constant juggling act, but I'm determined to graduate on time.  The biggest challenge is balancing everything and resisting procrastination.","My friend's birthday party this weekend should be a blast!

Conversely, neglecting to call my girlfriend left me feeling guilty, which demonstrates the importance of maintaining close relationships for my well-being.",I haven't really had any major disagreements lately. My essay mostly shows my desire to travel and meet people. I feel like I try to get along with most everyone.,"I get headaches sometimes, and when that happens, I just need to relax and de-stress. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I take a break from whatever is causing me stress and try to focus on something more calming.

I was motivated by the need to fulfill a requirement, but also by a slight curiosity about the subject matter. While the professor’s teaching style proved less than engaging (I fell asleep six times!), the experience ultimately broadened my awareness of different academic disciplines.","Balancing my college coursework and social life demanded careful planning and prioritization. I had to strategically allocate my study time, relying on creating manageable study schedules. Sticking to these plans was challenging at times, particularly when social events or my general apathy presented themselves.  However, seeing progress and achieving certain goals, like completing assignments, fueled my persistence.","I find large social gatherings draining. The superficial interactions and cliques I observed on campus left me feeling somewhat isolated and overwhelmed by the seeming lack of genuine connection.  This reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions with individuals I genuinely connect with.","My interactions with my classmates and professors, especially the economics professor, have highlighted disagreements. I generally approach conflicts by observing and analyzing from a detached viewpoint. I avoid confrontation, prioritizing my own mental and emotional well-being over directly addressing the conflict.","The pressure of college, combined with feelings of social awkwardness and academic stress, triggered significant anxiety. My initial response was apathy and avoidance. To manage it, I employ distraction techniques such as focusing on other tasks or trying to find humor in the situation.  I also recognize the value of talking to someone (like a therapist) to process these feelings.",y,y,n,y,y

The process of combining different ingredients and flavors, seeing how they interact, and creating something unique is incredibly satisfying.  My parents even suggest my love of cooking is connected to my aptitude for chemistry.","My goal is to graduate from college, ideally with honors. To stay on track, I maintain a structured schedule, prioritizing my studies and utilizing time management techniques.  Engineering is notoriously challenging, so I've learned to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Although I sometimes worry about falling short of expectations, I find the reward of academic success to be incredibly motivating.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained, rather than energized.  I tend to prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with a few people deeply. I think this is why I'm nervous about meeting my boyfriend's fraternity brothers; large, boisterous gatherings aren't my preferred environment. I value genuine connection and meaningful conversation over superficial interactions and noisy environments.","I have strong opinions, and disagreements with others can arise easily, particularly when it involves my boyfriend’s choices. For example, I dislike his fraternity and its influence on him.  I try to express my concerns directly, but sometimes my intensity and controlling nature make it hard to communicate effectively. My priority is maintaining a healthy relationship, but I find it difficult to compromise on certain issues and have trouble letting go of my worries.","The thought of upcoming tests and the pressure of succeeding in a difficult field like engineering causes me significant stress and anxiety.

For instance, DJing at that party was completely outside my comfort zone, but I was motivated by the chance to express myself creatively and it turned out great! Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and I felt a real sense of accomplishment afterwards, even if I personally felt it was “crappy”.  It definitely fueled my desire to try it again.","I'm not known for my meticulous planning.  My approach to goals is more impulsive and reactive. I often find myself scrambling to catch up, like with that calculus homework.  While I have good intentions, sustained effort is not my forte.  I tend to focus on immediate gratification rather than long-term planning.","Social interactions can be both draining and exhilarating. While I enjoy being around my friends, like at the party I DJ’ed, prolonged social engagements, such as lengthy conversations with John, can leave me feeling overwhelmed. I need time alone to recharge and process my thoughts, which the essay shows through my many random thoughts. The sheer volume of my thoughts shows this internal struggle.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll often try to find common ground or just let it slide rather than create tension, even if it means dealing with annoyance over time. My priority is maintaining harmony and positive relationships. The essay shows that I like my girlfriend a lot and would do anything for her.","Stress and anxiety are pretty common for me.  When overwhelmed, I tend to overthink and worry, like when I fretted over my calculus homework and the upcoming classes.

The essay reflects my preference for the familiar and my apprehension about deviating from what I know.

My essay shows I'm actively planning my future, demonstrating commitment and foresight. I'm already contemplating career paths and academic majors, indicating a proactive and organized approach to achieving long-term goals despite feeling overwhelmed at times.","Memorable social experiences tend to leave me feeling drained rather than energized, as shown in my preference for solitude. The essay highlights my introversion and how I recharge by spending time alone, rather than seeking social stimulation.  Large social gatherings or extended periods of socializing are not my preference.","Disagreements are handled with a focus on understanding, but not necessarily on immediate conflict resolution. I value my personal independence and beliefs and the essay shows I can hold my own views and even express them firmly in the face of conflicting opinions, even if those views sometimes put me at odds with my family and the Indian community.","While I experience stress and anxiety, as evident in my worries about the future and my identity, I don’t seem to be overcome by these emotions.

I'm more focused on enjoying the immediate moment than on long-term projects.  If something comes up that needs doing, I'll deal with it when the time comes. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.",Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained.  Spending time with a small group of close friends is much more enjoyable.  Being around a lot of people is overwhelming and anxiety-inducing.  Quiet time to recharge afterwards is essential.,"Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.  It's easier to just agree to disagree, or even to avoid the situation entirely.  Confrontation makes me uneasy.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.

I struggle with time management and often leave things until the last minute. While I might *intend* to do something, actually doing it is a different story.","Social interactions can be draining. Large groups or overly stimulating environments tire me out.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings or even just spending time alone.  I recharge best by being on my own.","When I disagree with someone, I generally try to be understanding and avoid conflict. I prioritize maintaining the relationship and finding a compromise, even if it means I have to slightly compromise on my own viewpoint.

Staying on task is difficult for me.  I had to relearn the cheers for the football game, but that was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing than a planned effort towards a long-term goal.","Social situations can be draining. The graduation party was a good example; having to deal with someone difficult was not enjoyable. I much prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I like – like the cute guys I've met here.  Large parties, while fun at times, tend to leave me exhausted.","Disagreements are something I try to avoid or simply endure. At the graduation party, the ""real bitch"" friend made it her way, and I just dealt with it.  It's easier for me to go along with things than to confront conflict.","I get stressed easily.  My roommate being around is a source of stress and anxiety for me as is the lack of a working computer.

I used a planner to schedule my study time and work shifts, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance.  When things got overwhelming, I broke down large assignments into smaller, manageable chunks and utilized campus resources like tutoring.

I'll break down the task into smaller steps, create a to-do list, and reward myself for completing each step. Talking to my friends usually helps, or I'll take a walk to clear my head and relax.

I haven't employed specific time management techniques. My commitment stems more from a deep-seated desire for achievement and a fear of falling short than from strict planning.  The challenge has been maintaining focus amidst social anxieties and the lack of a strong support network.","Most social interactions leave me feeling drained, rather than energized.  The essay highlights my struggle to connect with peers, even when I make an effort.  This is probably due to my introverted nature and my difficulty in expressing myself effectively and also dealing with people's reactions.

I typically try to calmly explain my perspective, using logic and reason, but I often give up when met with resistance or dismissive responses. My priority is to maintain politeness, but my desire for intellectual understanding can sometimes be frustrated.","The constant worry about my lack of friends and social isolation is a significant source of stress and anxiety for me.

The idea of sustained effort and careful planning feels tedious and restrictive.  If I even attempt a goal, I don't bother with time management or strategies. I'm more likely to abandon it if it becomes inconvenient or difficult.","Social interactions generally drain me.  I prefer solitary activities. Seeing bands with my friends is an exception. Even then, the energy I expend interacting leaves me feeling exhausted, and it only serves to validate my preference for smaller groups and minimal social interaction.  I rarely initiate social contact.","Disagreements are handled by avoidance if possible or, if unavoidable, with a sarcastic and impatient attitude. I don't prioritize resolving conflicts; my priority is to get the interaction over with as quickly as possible.

I'm meticulously planning my application and making sure I meet all the deadlines.

In the essay, I describe the feeling of being an outsider and the awkward questioning from some people about why I moved to Texas, which indicates that I have discomfort with disagreement.

I’m more comfortable with the familiar and comfortable, although I am open to new experiences when I feel safe and secure.","Staying organized and on top of my schoolwork is definitely a challenge for me.  I plan to try my best to graduate in a couple of years, but keeping track of all my assignments and homework at a big university feels overwhelming. I'm hoping to develop better time management skills and strategies to stay on track, but it's a work in progress.  I can see how important good organization is, but I struggle to implement it.","I love being around my friends, especially those I already know.  Spending time with them from high school here in Austin really energizes me and makes me feel good; having that support system is essential.  Meeting new people, on the other hand, can be draining initially.  I can seem shy at first, but once I feel comfortable, I open up and am much more outgoing. I definitely need that time to warm up.","I generally try to be agreeable and understanding, even in disagreements.  If I disagree with someone, I try to listen to their perspective and communicate my own calmly, focusing on finding common ground or at least mutual understanding. I don't like conflict, so avoiding it or approaching it with empathy is important to me.","Leaving home and starting college was really stressful and anxiety-inducing. I felt sad, glum, and anxious about leaving everything familiar behind.  To cope, I lean on my friends for support.  Knowing that I have a support system makes a big difference, although sometimes, I just like to sleep off my anxieties!",n,n,y,y,y
524,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences.  My life is pretty structured and focused on my goals.  While I appreciate the idea of trying something completely different, my priorities are more geared towards mastering the things I'm already committed to. I'm not drawn to the unknown in the same way that some people are.","Achieving a 3.75 GPA this semester is my main focus.  I’ve created a detailed schedule to balance work, classes, meetings, and study time. I use planners, to-do lists, and break down large tasks into smaller, manageable ones.  The biggest challenge is managing unexpected delays or setbacks, but I try to adjust my schedule and remain optimistic about catching up. The reward is the sense of accomplishment when I check off tasks and see progress toward my goal.","Working at the daycare is a very energizing social experience for me.  I love interacting with the infants; their trust and innocence are incredibly rewarding. I find that being around other people, particularly people who are easy to be around and positive, increases my energy levels. Conversely, if I'm feeling drained, I need some quiet time to recharge.","I try to approach disagreements with understanding and empathy. My priority is to find common ground, even if we don't ultimately agree. I focus on listening to the other person's perspective and expressing my own point of view clearly and respectfully.  Compromise is important to me; maintaining positive relationships matters more than being ""right.""","The beginning of the semester is always stressful. My initial response is to feel overwhelmed, but I try to channel that stress into creating a plan and sticking to it.  Breaking down my workload into smaller, manageable steps helps immensely, and I also try to take short breaks to avoid burnout. I remind myself that it is only the beginning of the semester and it is a marathon, not a sprint.",n,y,y,y,n
525,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  My life is fairly structured around my family and friends, and I prefer activities I already enjoy, like horseback riding.  Even though I really want to visit New York City, the thought of venturing so far from my familiar routines makes me a bit uneasy.  The spider experiment for my birthday is an exception, more due to circumstance than a deep desire for novelty.","I'm pretty organized and responsible.  Managing my schoolwork is a priority, although this week's English assignment mishap shows I'm not perfect.  Generally, I use lists and calendars, and I'm quite diligent about completing tasks, even if I have to adjust my schedule to deal with unexpected events.  The rewarding part is the feeling of accomplishment when things go well; the challenging part is when unexpected events like the lost assignment throw a wrench in my plans.","I'm definitely more of a homebody; large, exciting social events drain my energy. Spending time with my close friends, like my best friend at A&M or seeing my friends at UT, is fulfilling, providing a comfortable and reassuring sense of connection.  Overwhelming social situations, however, feel overstimulating and exhausting. I cherish my quiet time, needing that time to recharge from interactions, even positive ones.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  When disagreements arise, I prioritize maintaining positive relationships. I prefer to listen to the other person's perspective and find common ground, even if that means compromising.  It's important to me to keep things calm and respectful, so I'll often work towards a solution that keeps everyone happy.","I definitely tend to feel anxious and stressed. The lost assignment and the rain preventing my horse-riding plans significantly contributed to a negative day. My response is often to worry about things I can't control.  I try to manage stress by focusing on activities I enjoy, like spending time with my horse, or talking with my friends.  Distraction and positive social interaction are my primary coping mechanisms.",n,y,n,y,y
526,"I did try something new this past weekend — going out and doing something other than staying home and watching TV. It was a departure from my usual routine, spurred mostly by boredom and a desire for something…different. Afterward, I felt better than usual, but it was also a mixed bag of emotions.  I had fun, but I also felt the usual anxiety and uncertainty that accompany any kind of change.","Honestly, I haven't really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort.  I tend to react to what's immediately in front of me rather than planning meticulously.  The essay assignment, for example—I’m just getting it done to get it done.  That's how I manage my time and resources; I react to things as they arise.","Going home to see my family this weekend is a stressful thing. While I love them, a lot of attention can be draining.  What makes the interaction draining is the constant questions and worries about me that my mom expresses. I prefer my alone time and the quiet, so large family gatherings leave me feeling more drained than energized.","I don't often disagree with people openly, but I do have internal disagreements frequently.  I avoid direct confrontation usually.  My priority is to avoid conflict and keep the peace; I might internalize the disagreement rather than resolving it directly.","The constant back-and-forth over whether or not to go home this weekend has been incredibly stressful. I felt anxious, uncertain and a little overwhelmed by the decision.  My initial response is to avoid dealing with it by focusing on other things, but ultimately, I’m dealing with it by writing this essay (and perhaps overthinking things).",y,n,n,y,y
527,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I'm content with what I know.  Watching Sling Blade was probably the closest I came to something new recently, and even then, it was more about a familiar genre than exploring something entirely different. I didn't feel strongly about it one way or another.","I definitely struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals. My GPA dropping shows that.  I had good intentions, but lacked the discipline to follow through.  I really don't have any particular strategies for staying on track; that's part of the problem. The most rewarding thing is when things go well, but the challenging part is everything else.","Social situations often drain my energy, even simple interactions. I prefer to be alone. That dorm meeting was a perfect example.  The news about the cleaning schedule made me anxious, not energized, revealing that I really prefer limited social interaction.","I don't usually seek out conflict, and I'd rather avoid confrontation.  If I disagree with someone, I'll probably just keep quiet or maybe mention it casually.  My priority isn't necessarily resolving the disagreement, but just maintaining peace.",I'm frequently stressed and anxious.  The fear of my grades slipping is a constant source of worry.  My initial response is often to avoid the situation or dwell on the negative.  I don't have any specific strategies for constructive management; I just hope things improve.,n,n,n,n,y
528,"In 11th grade, I participated in a stream-of-consciousness writing exercise.  While I wasn't particularly motivated by any grand ambition, the novelty of the task and the opportunity to explore my thoughts without constraint appealed to me. Afterward, I felt a curious mix of amusement and self-consciousness—amusement at the randomness of my thoughts, and self-consciousness about sharing such a raw, unfiltered perspective.","I haven't explicitly described a long-term goal in my essay, but implicitly, finishing my stream-of-consciousness assignment was one.  I managed my time by dedicating 20 minutes specifically to this task. While I didn't employ any formal time management strategies, my commitment stemmed from the assignment's requirement and a perhaps self-serving desire for brownie points. The challenge was keeping my mind focused and generating ideas consistently, but the reward was simply the completion of the assignment.","My essay reflects a preference for social interaction. I mention interactions with my roommate, and my excitement for choir—I crave the energy these interactions provide. The thought of others reading my writing, whether it's my psychology professor or classmates, motivates me, even though I worry about their judgment.  It fulfills a need for connection and shared experience.","I haven't presented any direct conflict in my writing, implying an inclination to avoid or easily resolve disagreements. My thoughts and observations suggest a generally positive attitude towards people even while pointing out some minor differences or preferences. I prioritize avoiding overt conflict and maintain a largely agreeable approach in my interactions.","Although I express frustration with technical difficulties (like typing) and concerns about others' opinions, I don't exhibit signs of significant stress or anxiety. My overall tone remains light-hearted and self-deprecating. I seem to manage my emotions primarily through humor and self-reflection rather than overt expressions of distress.",y,y,y,y,n
529,"I’m fascinated by the lives of celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio.  His career, the pressures of fame, it all seems so different from my own experience. Watching his films, I've pondered what it must be like to live a life under such intense scrutiny. It makes me consider different lifestyles and how people navigate extraordinary circumstances.","I'm not a naturally organized person, but I have goals, like finally watching *Titanic* in its entirety. While I don't meticulously schedule my time, I ensure I create opportunities to indulge in things I value.  The reward for achieving those small goals, even simple ones like a movie marathon, gives me a sense of accomplishment and boosts my motivation.","Large, loud social gatherings can be draining. However, I really enjoy quiet time with close friends and family where we can engage in deeper, more meaningful conversations. These quieter, more intimate settings allow me to connect with people on a level that energizes me more than a huge party ever could.","I try to understand differing perspectives, even when I strongly disagree.  In conflict, my priority is to listen to the other person's point of view and find common ground. For example, I wouldn't argue with someone who enjoys celebrity gossip magazines—I'd simply acknowledge their preference and respectfully steer the conversation elsewhere.","I don't typically experience intense anxiety.  If faced with a stressful situation, such as thinking about mortality, I address it by contemplating my own aspirations and focusing on what I can realistically accomplish during my life. My reaction is more of quiet reflection than panic.",y,y,y,y,n

What motivated me was the desire for a fresh start and the excitement of being around such a diverse group of people.  Afterward, I felt a mix of exhilaration and slight anxiety, but mostly a sense of possibility and adventure.","Setting and achieving academic goals in college has required significant self-discipline. I prioritize my studies, creating a weekly schedule and sticking to it as much as possible. When I get behind, I adjust my schedule and actively seek help if needed. It's challenging to balance social life with academics, but I find the feeling of accomplishment rewarding when I successfully complete a challenging assignment or project.",A memorable social experience was simply walking around Austin and observing people. The diversity and energy of the city are invigorating.  I find fulfillment in interacting with people from all walks of life and learning about their unique experiences.  The constant stimulation of the city’s atmosphere is generally a positive thing for me.,"I try to approach disagreements with an open mind and focus on understanding the other person’s perspective. I prioritize finding common ground and resolving conflicts constructively through communication and compromise.  If that’s not possible, I prioritize maintaining a respectful relationship, even if we disagree.","Feeling overwhelmed by the transition to college initially caused me stress and anxiety.

The transition to college, with its larger classes and reliance on technology, has been a significant adjustment, but it wasn't something I actively sought out.  It was more of a necessary change, and while I'm somewhat apprehensive about navigating the new environment and technology, I'm trying to adapt. My motivation is simply to succeed in my studies.","Staying on top of my studies in college has been my main goal.  I’m using a planner to keep track of assignments and deadlines, and I've found that writing things down helps immensely to reduce stress and avoid forgetting things.  Balancing classes, homework, and other responsibilities has been challenging at times, but I find the reward of completing tasks and avoiding procrastination is extremely motivating.","Large lecture halls can be overwhelming. The sheer number of students initially drained me, making me feel a bit out of place. I prefer smaller settings, like those I experienced in high school. This experience highlighted my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings, although I do find that interacting with a few classmates after class is energizing.","I haven't had any major disagreements yet, but the water main break at my apartment building created a shared inconvenience that my roommates and I handled with cooperation and understanding. Everyone pitched in to find solutions, such as using the Taco Bell restroom. This situation reinforced how important cooperation and mutual support can be in stressful situations.","The first day of college, and the subsequent water main break, were quite stressful.  My initial reaction was anxiety, but I'm actively trying to manage this by writing things down to stay organized and remembering to prioritize tasks. I also make an effort to slow down instead of trying to do everything at once.",n,y,y,y,y

Afterward, I felt invigorated and excited; it added a new dimension to my life and confirmed my desire to pursue more extreme sports. The sense of danger and physical exertion are incredibly rewarding.","Achieving my goal of improving my surfing required consistent practice and dedication. I scheduled regular sessions, even when tired or busy, using visualization and setting smaller milestones to stay focused.  The initial difficulty was frustrating, but the improvement and resulting physical and mental wellbeing were incredibly satisfying.","A recent street hockey game was incredibly energizing. The friendly competition, teamwork, and shared adrenaline were incredibly fulfilling.  It reinforced my preference for social interaction with shared physical activity and demonstrated that participating in these activities boosts my mood.","In a disagreement with a friend about the best surfing spot, I prioritized open communication and understanding their perspective. I listened to their reasons, explained my own, and ultimately we found a compromise that worked for both of us.  Maintaining the friendship was important, and finding a compromise achieved that.","Before a big surfing competition, I felt anxious.  To manage my stress, I focused on my physical preparation and practiced relaxation techniques like deep breathing.  Remembering previous successes and reminding myself of the enjoyment of the sport helped alleviate the anxiety and enabled me to enjoy the competition.",y,y,y,y,n

I was motivated by a genuine interest in the subjects, finding them far more engaging than previous summer courses. Afterward, I felt a sense of intellectual stimulation and excitement, a feeling entirely different from the boredom I experienced elsewhere.","I haven't really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort.  I tend to focus on immediate things, like enjoying my classes and seeing my family.  Time management isn't a strong suit of mine, and I often prioritize my immediate feelings over long-term planning.","Spending a lot of time on the phone with family and friends back home is really important to me.  While I miss them intensely and derive comfort from those calls, I also have moments of feeling drained from the amount of effort it takes to maintain those connections. I am not an extrovert; I prefer smaller, close-knit social groups.","My disagreement with my sister stemmed from her constant unsolicited advice.  I reacted emotionally and perhaps overreacted by forbidding her from my dorm. While I value our relationship, my immediate emotional response was prioritized over a calm and measured approach to the conflict. I am usually very agreeable but sometimes have trouble dealing with criticism, which is what sparked the fight.","Leaving home and starting college has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was to call home frequently and focus on the comfort of my family and boyfriend. To manage this, I lean on my support system and try to focus on the positive aspects of my new experience.  However, this is not a simple fix, and the anxiety is often overwhelming.",y,n,n,y,y

My stories often explore unusual concepts and scenarios, reflecting a fascination with the unexpected and a desire to push creative boundaries. The process of writing itself is a new experience every time, motivating me to experiment with different styles and approaches.  While the results might not always be coherent, the act of creating is deeply fulfilling.","I don't really focus on long-term goals or planning.  My approach to writing is more impulsive and spontaneous; I just start writing whatever comes to mind without much structure or pre-planning.  I am not someone who is driven by self-imposed schedules or deadlines, and my process is more reactive and influenced by immediate whims and ideas.  The challenge is that this can lead to some unfinished or half-baked projects, but the reward is the freedom to explore my creativity without restriction.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. I prefer solitude and find it more energizing to work on my own projects or lose myself in my imagination, as evidenced by my preference for writing stories over direct social engagement.  Large social gatherings or extended periods of interaction with others can be overwhelming and lead to feelings of anxiety and exhaustion, highlighting my introverted nature. The need to withdraw and recharge after such events is a significant factor in how I structure my days and interactions.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I’m more likely to quietly retreat or simply go along with things to maintain harmony rather than risk confrontation.  Maintaining a sense of peace and avoiding arguments is a higher priority than expressing my disagreement forcefully. My stories sometimes hint at this avoidance through their meandering, non-confrontational style.","I experience stress and anxiety fairly frequently.  My initial response to stress is often avoidance or retreat into my own thoughts and internal world, as expressed by the abrupt endings in my stories. However, I eventually engage in creative pursuits like writing stories as a way to process my emotions and find a constructive outlet for these feelings. The act of writing can be a coping mechanism allowing me to understand and address these anxieties indirectly.",y,n,n,y,y

The experience was mostly positive; I enjoyed trying it out and was pleasantly surprised by the results.  It’s small things like this that I find interesting.","Goals aren't really my thing. I tend to go with the flow and don't focus on long-term planning.  My friend, on the other hand, is very goal-oriented; he's planning a year-long trip to see Dave Matthews. While I admire his ambition,  I'm not sure I could maintain that level of focus myself.

On the rare occasions I find myself alone, I don't get terribly lonely as long as I have a project to occupy my time. I appreciate the constant flow of conversation and people in my life.","I don't always agree with others, especially my housemate who seems excessively concerned with trivial matters like missing hot dog buns and moved milk. I find his anxiety over these things a bit much, even though I try to approach the situation with some understanding. Conflict isn't something I actively seek out, but I also avoid confrontation.","I don’t often dwell on stressful situations.  However, I am concerned about some things, like the unusual weather patterns. It bothers me when things aren't “normal”.

I set goals, like keeping up with my studies and extracurriculars, but I struggle with staying organized and prioritizing tasks effectively.  My approach is more reactive; I handle things as they come up rather than proactively planning. I'm learning the hard way about budgeting my money, too.","I thrive in social situations; parties and hanging out with my friends energize me.  Meeting new people and having fun with my fraternity brothers is a huge part of my college experience.  However, managing multiple romantic interests simultaneously is proving to be more challenging and has led to some awkward moments.","I generally try to be agreeable and get along with everyone, but I’m not always good at confronting conflict directly.  I avoid awkward conversations, like with the girl I’m casually seeing, rather than addressing the issues head-on. This sometimes leads to more problems in the long run.","I don’t get stressed out easily.  The physical demands of my busy schedule are taxing, and I’ve experienced some pretty unpleasant physical symptoms like throwing up from ROTC, but generally, I remain optimistic and don't dwell on problems. Money worries are a concern, but I’m not letting it get to me too much.",n,n,y,y,n

I need a balance of social connection with time for solitary reflection.","I haven't detailed specific conflicts, but the essay suggests I tend towards self-reflection and introspection even when dealing with disagreements. My priorities are likely self-improvement and understanding my own feelings and reactions rather than direct confrontation. It might be easier for me to avoid conflict initially than to actively confront it.","I experience significant anxiety and worry, as evident in my reflections on mortality, fears of failure, and negative self-perception.

I prioritized my studies, managing my time effectively to balance academics with my social life.  Staying committed, even when overwhelmed, involved focusing on my long-term goals and seeking support from my girlfriend. It was challenging, but the sense of accomplishment was incredibly rewarding.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer deeper connections with a few close people, such as Mandi, my girlfriend.  Memorable social experiences have involved quiet moments of shared understanding and support with those I’m close to. I now understand that my energy is better spent nurturing meaningful relationships rather than large, superficial interactions.","Disagreements with others are difficult.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation, prioritizing the relationship and attempting to find common ground.  If that's not possible, I'll step away to process my feelings before re-engaging, focusing on mutual understanding even if we don't agree.","Leaving home caused immense stress and anxiety.

Getting into college was a big goal of mine, and I meticulously planned my high school coursework to meet the admissions requirements.

544,"Last summer, I decided to take up rock climbing.  I'd always been more of a bookish type, but a friend convinced me to try it, and the challenge intrigued me. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the physical and mental aspects; it was a fantastic way to push my boundaries and gain a new perspective on my capabilities.  Afterwards, I felt exhilarated and accomplished.","I set a goal to maintain a consistent study schedule this semester to achieve a high GPA. I created a detailed planner, allocating specific time slots for each class and study session.  To stay motivated, I built in reward systems for meeting milestones. While there were definitely times I felt overwhelmed,  breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks helped immensely. The rewarding part was seeing my hard work pay off in good grades.","A recent party was incredibly energizing.  The music was great, and I easily struck up conversations with several people.  The positive energy of the crowd was infectious, and I left feeling refreshed and connected.  It reaffirmed that I thrive in social situations with good vibes and engaging interactions; conversely, being in an environment that felt stifling and unfriendly would leave me feeling drained and unfulfilled.","I recently disagreed with a classmate about a group project approach.  Instead of directly confronting him, I focused on finding common ground. I tried to understand his perspective, and we ultimately compromised, finding a solution that worked for both of us. My priority was to collaborate and produce a successful project, even if it meant sacrificing some of my initial preferences.","When I started college and felt really overwhelmed adjusting to my new environment and feeling quite homesick, my initial response was sadness and some self-doubt.  But I reminded myself that this was a normal part of a big transition. To cope, I reached out to family and friends, and focused on establishing a routine to manage my time. It helped me to remind myself that these feelings are temporary.",y,y,y,n,n
545,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying completely new things.  The essay shows I enjoy familiar things like seeing friends and movies (Titanic, twice!). While I went to a Longhorn game, that’s a fairly common social activity, not something radically different. Novel experiences aren't my primary motivation.","I'm pretty organized and focused on my goals.  The essay shows that while school is starting to worry me, I’m aware of upcoming tests and deadlines, even if I procrastinate a bit.  I manage my time by fitting in work at the recreation center and socializing with friends. I prioritize having fun, but I also realize I need to manage my time effectively, even if I don't always succeed.","The Longhorn game was definitely energizing – the essay speaks to the excitement of meeting new people in a social setting and my desire to build friendships.  Being with friends this weekend was also fulfilling, although the distance once they left highlighted my need for consistent, close connections.  I clearly thrive in social situations but also feel the effects of isolation.","I'm not always good at resolving conflict directly.  The essay focuses more on my feelings of frustration (living at home, distance from friends) rather than any direct confrontations.  I tend to internalize my disagreements and focus on my own experiences rather than directly addressing conflicts with others.","My anxieties are clearly present.  I dwell on the frustrations of living at home and the challenges of making new friends in college.  I'm sensitive to changes, missing old friendships and feeling isolated in this new environment. My coping mechanisms include listening to relaxing music (the Titanic soundtrack), which helps to calm me down when I'm stressed.",n,y,y,n,y
546,"Last summer, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I'd always been drawn to art, but never considered myself particularly crafty. The experience itself was surprisingly enjoyable—I loved the feel of the clay and the creative process. Though my finished products weren't masterpieces, the whole thing was liberating and fun.","I don't really plan things out. I tend to just go with the flow, tackling things as they come up. Deadlines can be stressful, but I somehow usually manage to meet them. My approach is pretty much ""winging it"", and while it's not always efficient, it works for me – at least most of the time.","I thrive in lively social settings. A recent concert with friends is a perfect example – the energy of the crowd, the music, and the shared experience were incredibly uplifting.  Conversely, small talk or forced interactions drain me; I need genuine connection and shared enthusiasm to feel truly energized.","I have a hard time letting things go if I disagree with someone, often voicing my perspective even if it's uncomfortable. I prioritize honesty, even when it might lead to conflict. It's rarely easy, but for me, integrity is worth more than avoiding disagreement.","When overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, like after a particularly grueling day of classes, my initial response is often to focus on the positive aspects of my life. I try to actively push away negative thoughts and find things to be grateful for. This mindset helps me regain perspective and manage my emotions more effectively.",y,n,y,n,y
547,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  The essay mentions feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of different people at college, and that highlights my preference for the familiar.  New things tend to make me anxious rather than excited. I'm perfectly content sticking to what I know.","I don't exactly excel at planning or sticking to schedules. My calculus test is looming, and the essay reflects my procrastination; I'm hoping tutoring will help me cram, rather than setting up a detailed study plan.  I tend to operate more on impulse and deal with things as they come.","I thrive in social situations, as the essay mentions my active high school life.  The large, diverse college environment feels overwhelming though.  Being surrounded by so many strangers drains me. I am energized by close friends and smaller, more familiar social groups.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with.  Disagreements make me uncomfortable, so I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.  The essay doesn’t describe a specific conflict, but it highlights my anxiety about fitting in and performing well, demonstrating an internal focus on my own performance rather than easygoing compromise.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress, as the essay clearly shows with my worries about the upcoming calculus test and the pressures from my parents. My initial response to stress is often fear and panic. The essay shows I am actively seeking solutions (tutoring) which is one way I try to cope, but the anxiety is still clearly there.",n,n,y,n,y
548,"I’m not one for radically new experiences.  Starting college is a big change, of course,  meeting new people and being in a new environment.  But I'm mostly motivated by the idea of proving myself academically, and while it's different, I'm not necessarily seeking out the unusual. I prefer to focus on what I know I can handle and excel at.","I haven't exactly been meticulous in my approach to goals.  I want to do well in college, but my approach is more about grasping opportunities as they arise and less about strict planning or detailed scheduling. If something interests me, I get involved. If it doesn’t, I will most likely avoid it.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I know and feel comfortable with.  Meaningful conversations with a close friend over a shared meal, for example, leaves me feeling much better. I find noisy crowded rooms stressful and will avoid large parties.","I prioritize harmony in disagreements. I try to understand the other person's perspective and find common ground, even if I don't fully agree with their position.  My aim is to resolve conflicts peacefully and maintain good relationships. I don't like conflict.","I generally handle stress pretty well. I tend to be more pragmatic than emotional in my responses.  If I'm feeling stressed, I'll usually focus on what I can control, like getting my work done or finding time to relax, instead of dwelling on anxieties.",n,n,n,y,n
549,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  High school was comfortable, and while college is a change, it's not exactly a radical departure from what I'm used to.  I'm focused on getting through it and fulfilling my responsibilities, rather than exploring uncharted territory.  My priorities are straightforward:  academics, my fraternity, and making my family proud.","I haven't developed elaborate time management systems, but I haven't missed a single class so far, despite the long hours.  My motivation is largely driven by my father's expectations and my commitment to succeeding in college and supporting my family later on.  It's a challenge balancing everything, especially the lack of sleep, but the pressure keeps me going; avoiding failure is my primary strategy.","The fraternity is a social experience.  While I enjoy meeting the girls, the constant demands and interactions can be draining.  It's mostly a means to an end;  I'm not someone who thrives on constant socializing.  I value the friendships, but I need my alone time to recharge and focus on my studies.","I tend to keep to myself and avoid conflict whenever possible.  I've not really had much conflict, so I've not needed to develop elaborate conflict resolution skills.  When interrupted or bothered by salespeople, I find ways to shut down the interaction quickly and return to my tasks.  My priority is to minimize disruption to my studies.","The constant pressure of college, fraternity pledgeship, and limited sleep cause stress and anxiety. My initial reaction is frustration, but I keep moving forward by focusing on my responsibilities. I address my frustration by taking action and staying busy with my tasks. While I feel the pressure, I handle it by keeping busy and avoiding dwelling on the stress.",n,n,n,n,n
550,"I recently started playing racquetball, something completely outside my usual routine.  The motivation was simple—a desire for something new and active, and perhaps a way to meet people. Although initially awkward,  the experience was ultimately quite positive, proving to be a good physical outlet and a surprising source of enjoyment.","I struggle with long-term goals.  While I might start something with enthusiasm (like working out), I often lose steam quickly when faced with difficulties. My time management is poor, and I don't employ any consistent strategies to stay on track.  The rewarding aspect of any goal is the initial burst of energy; the challenge is maintaining it.","Social interactions are generally draining for me.  The racquetball encounter, though positive in its activity, left me feeling somewhat depleted.  I prefer smaller, quieter interactions and find large groups or overly stimulating social situations overwhelming and exhausting.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  If I disagree with someone, I'm more likely to withdraw or passively express my opinion than engage in an argument. My priority is minimizing conflict, even if it means compromising my own needs or perspectives.","Frustration with technology easily triggers stress and anxiety.  My initial response is often anger and irritation, followed by a sense of helplessness. I attempt to manage these feelings by taking breaks, listening to music, and avoiding the source of my frustration—at least temporarily.",y,n,n,n,y
551,"I'm fascinated by learning about myself, as evidenced by my purchase of that horoscope postcard. Although I know those are simplified, the idea of exploring my personality traits is intriguing.  Trying to understand how different aspects of my personality interact is something I find appealing, even if it's not always accurate.  The experience left me wanting more self-discovery opportunities.","I haven't exactly mastered time management or goal setting as an adult; I’m finding the transition from high school quite challenging.  The sheer volume of reading and studying is overwhelming. My high school success without much effort has made college far more difficult. I am aware of my struggle, and hope to improve my ability to focus and study going forward.","Large classes leave me feeling drained. I enjoy talking to people, but I am intimidated by the formal atmosphere of college and the large class sizes. The experience of being called on in class and giving a partially incorrect answer left me feeling embarrassed and self-conscious and I think that illustrates how these interactions negatively impact me.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. I prioritize maintaining harmony. When I disagree with someone, I would rather avoid confrontation and maintain peace.  If forced to address a conflict, I would do so with a focus on mutual understanding and compromise, rather than winning or losing an argument.",Being called on in class and giving a partially incorrect answer was quite stressful.

I didn't have any specific strategies to manage these emotions; I just let it hang over me for a while.,y,n,n,y,n
552,I don't really seek out new experiences.  I tend to stick to what I know and am comfortable with.  Trying something completely different feels risky and makes me anxious.  The thought of stepping outside my routine isn't appealing to me.,"I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  Procrastination is a huge problem for me, and I often find myself overwhelmed by tasks.  While I recognize the importance of things like my German assignments,  I have difficulty prioritizing and managing my time effectively.  This results in a lot of stress and last-minute rushes.","Social situations can be both enjoyable and exhausting.  Small gatherings with close friends are energizing,  but larger, more demanding social interactions drain me. I prefer intimate settings where I can be myself and avoid the pressure of constant engagement.","I value harmony in my relationships. When disagreements arise, I try to approach them with understanding and empathy, prioritizing finding a resolution that works for everyone. If a compromise isn't possible, I'll still try to maintain a respectful approach to the situation.","Stress and anxiety are common feelings for me.

553,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  The foam party was a spontaneous thing, a friend invited me and it sounded fun, so I went. I enjoyed myself, but it wasn't a life-altering experience or something I'd actively pursue again.  It was more about being social and having a good time with friends, not about pushing my boundaries.","I'm pretty organized and goal-oriented. I'm currently working on getting into a business council, which I see as a goal that will require a lot of effort. I plan to manage my time by scheduling specific times to work on council-related tasks. I am aware of my tendency to get distracted so I need to be very organized. I find structure very rewarding.  The challenge will be balancing the council with school and other commitments.","The foam party was definitely an energizing social experience.  Being surrounded by people having fun, the music, the atmosphere—it was all incredibly uplifting and I felt very happy. I think I thrive in social situations that are upbeat and positive.  Quiet, introspective gatherings don't really energize me in the same way.","I try to be understanding and cooperative, even when I disagree.  With my boyfriend, I’m happy to compromise with where to go for spring break, although I’d rather go to the beach.  Ultimately, communication and finding a compromise that works for both of us is key for our relationship. I dislike conflict.","I don't typically experience high levels of stress or anxiety.

The sheer unknown and the challenge of adapting to a completely different environment motivated me. While initially apprehensive, I'm excited by the opportunities for growth and discovery this new chapter presents.  The lunch with my roommate's friends was also new and exciting, leading to interesting conversations.","I'm a very goal-oriented person. High school success instilled a desire to excel, so I'm approaching college with a similar mindset. While I'm not quite sure of my exact plan yet, the drive to succeed and to learn is a powerful motivator, and I’ll implement organizational methods and time management techniques to ensure I stay on top of my studies.  The challenge will be balancing academics with my social life.","Lunch with my roommate's friends was definitely energizing. The easy conversation and shared laughter were incredibly fulfilling.  It reinforced my preference for social interaction and the importance of building connections with others. This experience confirmed my enjoyment of social settings, and this is something that I intend to pursue even more now that I am in college.","I believe in open and honest communication, even when disagreements arise. If I were to find myself in disagreement with someone, I'd prioritize understanding their perspective before offering my own.  Compromise and mutual respect would be my guiding principles. Maintaining positive relationships while respectfully voicing my own opinion is very important to me.","I generally handle stress quite well. While starting college is naturally anxiety-inducing, I plan to approach it with a positive attitude and a proactive mindset.

My current college experience has been a shift, but mostly in terms of scale and environment – going from a huge high school to UT Austin.  That was enough of a change for me.","I'm definitely goal-oriented.  Getting into UT and securing a good living space were major goals.  I meticulously planned my application process, including researching and signing up for the various required steps (although I had some frustrating experiences in this area).  I'm very good at time management and prioritizing, although I admit to getting sidetracked occasionally by social events or things like repeated failed attempts at pre-tests. The reward is the feeling of accomplishment once the goal is achieved.","I love being social and thrive in group settings.  Moving into a room with Nissa who has similar tastes, and our plans to decorate and go shopping together, are a perfect example of a fulfilling interaction.  I get energized by connecting with people I like and who share common interests; it's a positive and exciting experience for me.  I actively seek out this type of social interaction.","I generally go with the flow and try to avoid conflict.  When disagreements arise, I focus on finding common ground and maintaining a positive relationship. I am quite willing to compromise and find solutions that work for everyone.  My roommate situation, where I moved in with Nissa because her original roommate didn’t show up, shows my tendency towards collaboration.","I don't generally get stressed or anxious.  The whole pre-test situation was a bit annoying (and frustrating because of the male-only slots), but I didn't experience it as debilitating stress. I handle minor frustrations by changing my approach or taking a break (like going shopping or hanging out with Nissa). I tend to approach most situations calmly and rationally.",n,y,y,y,n
556,I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences. I'm pretty content with my routine and familiar things.  The essay shows I'm focused on my studies and familiar comforts.  New things feel more stressful than exciting right now.,"My goal this semester is a high GPA. I'm meticulously managing my time with detailed notes and a rigid schedule, even if it feels overwhelming at times.  Staying on track is a priority, and I use strategies like breaking down tasks into smaller parts.  The challenge is balancing this with social life and managing stress; the reward will be the academic achievement.","Social interactions can be draining, especially when my schedule is already overloaded and I'm stressed.  A successful social interaction for me means relaxed time with close friends or family. The essay shows I do enjoy some social interactions (dates), but my energy is better spent alone, focusing on academics.","I try to be understanding and accommodating, but if someone disrupts my work (like roommates using my computer), I can get frustrated. I prioritize getting my work done, even if it means respectfully establishing boundaries. This is apparent in my frustration expressed in the essay about my roommates.","I get overwhelmed easily.  When stress hits, my initial response is anxiety and feeling overwhelmed. I manage it by focusing on completing tasks, one at a time and relying on my belief that things will improve. The essay shows how anxious I am about my schedule and academic performance; the repeated statements like ""if I can just make it to..."" highlight my tendency towards worry.",n,y,n,y,y
557,"While I don't readily embrace new experiences,  I did attempt to live with my boyfriend in El Paso for a few months.  It was motivated by a desire for closeness, but ultimately proved unsuccessful due to incompatibility. The experience reinforced my preference for independence, though I still miss him intensely.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My academic performance is a prime example. Although I recognize the need to study, I lack a structured plan and find it difficult to stay focused. The ambiguity of my coursework contributes to this, and math, in particular, presents a significant challenge due to my pre-calculus professor's teaching style.","Social interactions generally leave me drained, as evidenced by my discomfort with ambiguous assignments and my desire for isolation in the library. My relationship with my boyfriend highlights this, where even close proximity leads to conflict and mutual frustration, despite affection when apart.  I value my alone time and struggle in large social settings.","Disagreements are difficult for me to navigate.  My relationship with my boyfriend exemplifies this; our conflicts stem from our contrasting needs for independence and togetherness. While I value the connection, my own need for space and my avoidance of open conflict often lead to unresolved tension.","The essay itself reflects my anxieties. The feelings of insignificance, uncertainty about academic performance, and the distance from my boyfriend cause me significant stress. I manage this by isolating myself, and internally processing these emotions, avoiding direct confrontation or open discussion.",y,y,n,n,n

Going to camp that summer was probably the closest I've come to stepping outside my comfort zone, and even then, it was more about focusing on my summer job than exploring new things. While I met my girlfriend there, that wasn't exactly part of the plan.","Balancing my studies, lacrosse, fraternity, social life, and a long-distance relationship requires serious organization.  I prioritize my responsibilities, creating schedules and to-do lists, and making sure I allocate sufficient time for everything.  It's challenging at times, but I'm committed to succeeding academically and enjoying my college experience.  The reward is seeing all the aspects of my life work together.","Large social gatherings can be draining. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  Spending time with my fraternity brothers is energizing because it's with familiar people I'm comfortable around. The college parties are fun, but sometimes exhausting.  My ideal social interaction is being with my girlfriend; that's where I truly feel at ease and happy.","Disagreements are not something I relish.  My dad and I don't always see eye-to-eye about my girlfriend, but I try to explain my feelings calmly and rationally, even though his views are quite different from mine.

When I set a goal, I create a detailed plan, breaking it down into manageable steps. I use planners and to-do lists to stay on track, and I'm very diligent about meeting deadlines. The most challenging aspect is maintaining motivation during setbacks, but my strong sense of responsibility usually pushes me through.","I thrive in social situations with close friends and family.  Spending time with people I'm comfortable with energizes me; it's a source of enjoyment and happiness.  Large, unfamiliar groups, however, can be draining. I value genuine connections and prefer quality over quantity in my relationships.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me, but I try to approach them directly and honestly. My priority is resolving conflict fairly and efficiently, though I'm not always the best at understanding other people's perspectives.  I prefer to find common ground and move on, sometimes to the detriment of fully exploring the other person's view.","Generally, I don't experience significant stress or anxiety. I handle challenges calmly and rationally; I tend to approach problems practically.

While I did try out for Longhorn Band (a familiar activity, albeit a new setting), I ultimately prioritized my desire for weekend visits home, showing a resistance to significant changes.  New experiences tend to make me anxious, as evidenced by my apprehension about navigating the large campus and the uncertainty of college life.","My goal of maintaining my academic standing, even with the challenges of adjusting to college and choosing a difficult chemistry class, reflects my conscientiousness. I prioritized my studies despite the stress. My strategies included careful time management to avoid late arrivals to class and a determined approach to my academic responsibilities. Although I had reservations about chemistry, my perseverance shows commitment.","The essay makes it clear I'm not an extravert.  Social interactions at college, especially the large, anonymous classes, leave me feeling anxious and drained rather than energized. The excitement I felt was about the upcoming weekend to see loved ones--a small, familiar social circle. This experience reinforces my preference for smaller, intimate interactions with people I know and trust.","I strive to be agreeable.  While the essay doesn’t explicitly describe a conflict, my reaction to people assuming I'll drastically change in college suggests a commitment to my values and a potential for mild disagreement. I prioritize maintaining my moral standards and fulfilling the expectations others hold of me, even if it means pushing back against assumptions about my behavior.","The essay clearly illustrates my tendency towards neuroticism.  The fear of the unknown aspects of college life—the large campus, new classes, and changing social dynamics—caused significant stress and anxiety. My response was primarily avoidance; I wanted to stay in my dorm, suggesting a need for comfort and security.  I focused on coping mechanisms like anticipating visits home, but underlying anxieties remained.",n,y,n,y,n

My fascination with human behavior and my interest in art forms like drawing, playing clarinet and piano all point to a desire to experience different perspectives and creative outlets. Even pondering bizarre ideas, like how flammable my dorm room is, stems from a curious and open mind.","I haven't focused on long-term goals in a traditionally structured way.  The essay reveals scattered thoughts and ambitions, but lacks evidence of sustained effort towards a specific, measurable achievement.  However, my interest in learning instruments and improving my artistic abilities suggests a degree of dedication, though perhaps not always methodically planned.","The essay reveals a preference for solitary activities and observations. Social interactions, while present (boyfriend, brother), are mentioned without detailing energizing experiences.  My observation of people on the bus and reaction to a frat party suggests a degree of social discomfort or a preference for introspection rather than engaging in highly social situations.","I'm generally agreeable, evidenced by my good relationship with my brother and, presumably, my boyfriend.  However, there's also a hint of underlying irritability and frustration towards others, as seen in my thoughts about people on the bus.  My response to conflict is not explicitly detailed, yet the writing style suggests a willingness to observe rather than engage directly in confrontation.","The essay hints at anxieties and intense emotional experiences. My internal monologue displays anxieties, intrusive thoughts (flammability of my room, thoughts of hurting others which I immediately dismiss), and impulsive responses (the desire to prove someone wrong). I haven't developed explicit strategies for managing these, but the stream-of-consciousness style itself suggests a way of processing intense thoughts and emotions.",y,y,n,y,y

The upcoming test is looming, and I know I *should* study, but the thought of it feels overwhelming right now.  I'll probably procrastinate until the last minute, which is a bad habit I know I need to work on.  I find that sticking to a schedule is really difficult.","Large social gatherings can be draining for me. I enjoy hanging out with close friends, but I need plenty of downtime to recharge.  This weekend's plans sound fun, but I suspect I'll need a quiet night to myself afterwards. I'm definitely more of a homebody than an extrovert.","I felt strongly about the Clinton scandal and was appalled by the way his privacy was violated.

While the experience was frustrating due to technical difficulties and long wait times, the sheer novelty of navigating this new system, from one lab to another, appealed to my desire for exploration and problem-solving.  While initially annoyed, I ultimately learned about different lab resources and gained a greater understanding of the university's infrastructure (or lack thereof!).","My fitness goals this semester required consistent effort. I planned workouts meticulously, scheduling them and tracking my progress on a spreadsheet.  While summer inactivity set me back, I stayed committed by using creatine supplements to aid in muscle growth and regain strength and by ensuring I prioritized meals that supported my fitness plan, such as by packing my lunch.  The challenge was overcoming the initial soreness and pain from working out. But seeing my strength return, despite setbacks, was incredibly rewarding.","A memorable social interaction was the series of attempts to acquire a computer. The initial positive energy from my determination turned into a draining experience, due to repeated failures and escalating frustration.  The lack of success, particularly with the computer login and the inability to get the computer to cooperate with me,  highlighted my need for efficiency and positive outcomes, and confirmed my strong preference for smooth and productive interactions.  However, I did find a certain energy in persevering through the problems and in the hope of seeing a particular girl.","I generally prioritize maintaining pleasant interactions; however, today my patience was tested to its limits by the computer problems and the poor organization of the computer labs. I internally grumbled and cursed the computers, but outwardly I kept a cheerful disposition (partially to charm girls).  My priority wasn't necessarily resolving the conflicts (I accepted some failures), but maintaining a positive attitude and keeping my frustrations private.","The escalating frustrations from the computer lab mishaps today definitely caused stress and anxiety.  My initial reaction was a mix of anger and frustration, but I managed my emotions by focusing on my next steps:  finding another lab, focusing on my immediate task (even if the email was unavailable) and looking forward to lunch as a reward.

I utilize a planner and prioritize tasks—I tackle my most challenging work first. I find that breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps helps maintain momentum. While there are definitely times I feel overwhelmed, it's rewarding to see the progress I'm making.","My most energizing social experiences involve hanging out with my friends in my dorm. The shared laughter, inside jokes, and feeling of belonging invigorate me.  Spending time with people I connect with leaves me feeling fulfilled and reminds me how important close relationships are to my well-being.  Conversely, forced social interactions or large, impersonal gatherings can drain my energy.","Recently, I had a disagreement with my cousin about getting my notes from home.  My priority was resolving the issue quickly and efficiently. Although frustrated by the lack of coordination, I communicated clearly with him, and finding a solution (FedExing the materials) was a priority. Maintaining a positive relationship was important despite the logistical hurdles.","The sheer number of things going on in my life often leaves me feeling overwhelmed and stressed. My initial response is usually anxiety and a sense of being swamped. To manage this, I try to prioritize my tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable steps, and utilize relaxation techniques, like spending some quiet time in my dorm room.  Reaching out to my friends for emotional support also helps.",y,y,y,y,y
565,"I'm not one for meticulously planned adventures, but I did try something completely new this summer: I emailed an old friend after a long silence.  I was motivated by a sudden wave of missing her; it wasn't a carefully considered decision, more of an impulsive urge. Afterward, I felt a mix of hope and anxiety, mainly because I was waiting for her response and it was driving me a bit crazy.","I wouldn't say I'm the most organized person.  I tend to just do what I feel like doing at the moment and deal with the consequences (or lack thereof) later. Procrastination is basically a lifestyle choice for me, which I guess means I’m not particularly good at meeting deadlines.  My efforts tend to be sporadic bursts of frantic activity rather than sustained effort.","Social interactions aren't really my thing.  I enjoy the company of close friends occasionally, but large groups or forced interactions leave me drained. It's more that I’m not energized by them; I tolerate them instead.  My ideal social situation involves minimal human contact; my email exchange with my friend shows what I prefer.","Disagreements? I usually avoid them if I can. If I'm forced to confront conflict,  I tend to just let things slide unless it directly affects me. I’m not particularly invested in resolving disagreements unless they are a major inconvenience to me. The focus is mainly on my personal convenience.","Stress doesn't really bother me that much.  I usually just let it roll off my back.  If something really gets under my skin, I avoid it entirely. Or, I take out my frustration by doing something I enjoy, like watching football.  I don't dwell on my negative emotions.",y,n,n,n,n
566,"I don't usually seek out brand new experiences or ways of thinking.  My enjoyment comes from familiar things and activities.  The new country music I've started listening to is an exception, and I appreciate the deeper meaning in the lyrics compared to other genres.  It's a comfortable change, not a drastic one.","I'm not always the most organized person.  My approach to completing my pre-testing survey shows this; I got distracted and didn't finish it.  While I have goals, like doing well in my classes, my approach is often spontaneous. I rely more on motivation in the moment than meticulous planning. My competitive nature with my sister sometimes drives me forward to achieve goals.","Large social gatherings, like my cousin's engagement party, drain my energy. I'd rather spend time with close friends or family. The Shania Twain concert is an exception, it's something I'm looking forward to, but overall, I prefer quieter settings and smaller groups of people.  Being alone allows me to recharge.","I prioritize maintaining harmony in my relationships.  The disagreement with my sister highlighted this. Even though I wanted to avoid the rain, I feel bad about not walking with her and plan to apologize.  I value others’ feelings, even when it means compromising my own preferences. I believe in second chances and resolving conflicts amicably.","I generally handle stress well, although there is some worry about my assignment and if it meets expectations. I am usually calm under pressure, and I'm comfortable handling issues like the upcoming family gathering, even though I'm unsure about attending. I tend to take things one step at a time and don't let worry overcome me.",n,n,n,y,n
567,"Last year, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I was intrigued by the idea of creating something tangible with my hands, something completely outside my usual routine.  While I wasn't naturally gifted, I found the process oddly relaxing and satisfying; it was a great creative outlet.","I recently committed to learning a new language. I structured my study time, using apps and online resources, and set realistic daily goals. While maintaining consistency was sometimes difficult, rewarding myself for milestones and breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable ones kept me on track.  It's been challenging at times, but seeing my progress is incredibly motivating.","Going to see Loveline was a strangely energizing experience.  The candid questions and discussions, despite their sometimes shocking nature, felt oddly liberating.  It affirmed my interest in open and honest conversations, even about uncomfortable topics. It made me realize that connecting with others over shared experiences is genuinely stimulating.","My roommate and I have had our disagreements, primarily about cleanliness and household chores.  I try to address these conflicts directly, focusing on finding a compromise that works for both of us rather than letting resentment fester. Open communication, however imperfect, has been key to maintaining a relatively peaceful co-existence.","This week has been incredibly stressful.  I've been feeling overwhelmed by personal problems, and the lack of support from others has amplified my anxiety.  I've been trying to cope by journaling, listening to music, and focusing on small, manageable tasks to regain a sense of control, but finding productive ways to manage my feelings has been difficult.",y,y,y,y,y
568,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  My life is pretty structured and comfortable the way it is.  I prefer familiar routines and activities. The sorority is somewhat new, but mostly it’s just a structured social group.","I'm very organized and planful. Getting into Alpha Delta Pi required dedication—I had to meet certain requirements.  Balancing sorority commitments, academics (especially with those mandatory study hours!), and my boyfriend takes a lot of scheduling, but I'm good at managing my time.  The reward is belonging and academic success.","I'm not one for large social gatherings.  A big, noisy party would exhaust me. I recharge by spending time with my close family and boyfriend. The football game is fun, but seeing my boyfriend and family at the beach is much better.  Quiet time helps me recharge.","I don't always agree with people, but I usually try to avoid confrontation. The sorority has rules; I obey them to avoid any conflict.  My priority is maintaining harmony within my relationships and groups.","I get stressed easily, especially when overwhelmed.  Missing my boyfriend and family triggered some anxiety. Going home to be with loved ones and a familiar routine helps relieve that tension. My family are my biggest stress relievers.",n,y,n,n,y
569,"I've always been curious and willing to try new things.  For example, last semester I decided to take a psychology class even though I wasn't sure what to expect. It ended up being really interesting, and I met Jennifer, who is also in the class, at a party.  It pushed me outside my comfort zone in a good way, and I learned something new about myself.","Balancing school, social life, and my relationship with Kyle requires a lot of juggling. I try to make a mental to-do list each day and prioritize my tasks, but I'm not always successful.  I sometimes procrastinate and worry about upcoming tests and exams, but generally, my friends and my relationship with Kyle are also important to me, so I try to make time for those things.  The challenge is finding the balance; the reward is having a fulfilling life.","Meeting Kyle's family was a really positive social experience.  It made me feel happy and accepted, and it strengthened my relationship with Kyle even more.  Being around people I like and feeling connected energizes me; on the other hand,  I’ve had experiences where forced interactions have left me feeling drained. My preference is for meaningful connections with close friends rather than large groups.","I'm generally pretty agreeable and like to get along with people, but there are times when I don't agree with them.  For example, I was upset with Kyle for not coming over when he said he would, but I haven't confronted him yet; I’m not sure how to address it yet. I value maintaining my friendships, so conflicts make me feel uncomfortable. I usually try to talk things out calmly, even if that doesn't always lead to a resolution right away.","Thinking about all my classes and upcoming tests and exams does make me anxious at times.  When this happens, I usually try to talk to my friends or call someone like Kristine or Amy for emotional support to ease my worries. Sometimes it helps to talk about these things and put them into perspective.  Otherwise, I just try to focus on one thing at a time.",y,y,y,y,y
570,"Last year, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I'd always been drawn to the art, but never thought I had the patience or skill. The experience was surprisingly therapeutic, and although my creations weren't masterpieces, I found the process incredibly relaxing and rewarding.  I realized that stepping outside my comfort zone can lead to unexpected benefits.","I'm really struggling to maintain a good GPA.  I try to create study schedules and use time management apps, but my efforts are often inconsistent.  I'm easily distracted, and I tend to procrastinate, which makes staying on track a constant uphill battle. The pressure to succeed is intense, and I often feel overwhelmed rather than rewarded.","Spending time with close friends typically energizes me, particularly when we're engaging in shared activities like concerts or game nights. However, more superficial interactions often leave me feeling drained,  probably because I need genuine connection. It's reinforced my preference for quality over quantity in my relationships.","I try to be understanding, even in disagreements. However, when my dad insults my intelligence, it's hard to remain calm. In those situations, my priority is to protect my feelings, even if it means distancing myself temporarily. I try to express my feelings calmly but assertively; however, my emotions often overwhelm me before I can do so.","When I'm stressed, like now, I tend to get overwhelmed and anxious. My immediate response is to shut down and withdraw. It's difficult to constructively address my problems at those times, but I eventually try to talk to someone I trust (usually a friend) to help me process my emotions, which typically helps.",y,n,y,y,y
571,"I’m not one for grand adventures, but trying out this library computer assignment felt strangely new.  I usually avoid anything that feels like an experiment, but I was intrigued by the idea of just writing whatever came to mind.  The experience itself felt a bit odd, like an email but with more capitalization. Afterward, I felt relieved to have it done and a little curious about what the assignment's purpose truly is.","Goals?  Honestly, I don't really think in terms of long-term plans. Getting to class on time is a goal I struggle with, even though I know I should prioritize it.   My time management could certainly use work; I tend to leave things until the last minute, like this writing assignment.  The challenge is staying motivated, and the reward...well, there isn’t much reward beyond a sense of relief once it’s finished.","Social experiences? I tend to keep to myself. This assignment, in the library, was a fairly solitary experience. I’m not energized by large groups or extensive interaction.  Spending time alone generally isn’t draining, just…neutral. I prefer the quiet focus of my own thoughts and don't really crave large social gatherings.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out, but when they happen, I try to avoid conflict. I’ll usually just go with the flow rather than argue; my priority is to keep things calm. I’m not one to get into heated debates or stand my ground when it could disrupt the peace. It's easier to agree or avoid the issue, rather than trying to have a discussion.","This whole assignment has made me feel stressed. That's mainly because of the pressure of needing to finish it quickly, and the time constraints placed upon me.  Initially, I felt overwhelmed; the ticking clock and uncertainty over the nature of this exercise created anxiety. My coping strategy is procrastination - I get stressed and so I leave things until the last possible moment.",y,n,n,y,y

The whole idea of radically changing my routine just feels... unnecessary.,"Honestly, I haven't really had a long-term goal that required much planning.  I tend to focus on things as they come, and I haven't really developed strong time-management skills. I think I'm pretty good at adapting though.  When things get overwhelming, I figure it out as I go.","I love being around my roommate and other people I get along with!  Meeting new people and experiencing the social scene at college has been a huge part of what's helped me adjust.  It's invigorating and helps me forget about my worries, and I think having that social connection is pretty important to me.  I get energy from being around those people.","My roommate and I get along really well;  we have a lot in common. We just work so well together. We haven't had any major disagreements, so I haven't really had to deal with conflict. I tend to avoid confrontation.","Starting college was really stressful.  I was constantly lost and worried about classes.  I felt homesick and overwhelmed. Talking to my roommate helped a lot, though.  It was nice to have someone who understood what I was going through.  Eventually, I just adjusted and started enjoying myself more.",n,n,y,n,y
573,I don't really seek out new experiences.  I'm pretty content with what I know.  Sticking to the familiar is comfortable for me. Trying something new just feels like more hassle than it's worth.,"I don't really set long-term goals.  Things usually just happen, and I react to them as they come up. If something needs doing I might do it eventually but I'm not big on planning or sticking to schedules.  I'm not very organized.","Social situations aren't really my thing.  Large groups of people tend to leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed.  I prefer smaller interactions, or even just being alone. The thought of putting myself out there socially makes me anxious.","If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep it to myself or just avoid the topic altogether.  Confrontation isn't something I enjoy, and I prioritize avoiding conflict over expressing my opinion, even if I think it's important.","I worry a lot.  Stress and anxiety are pretty regular parts of my life.  When things get overwhelming, I tend to overthink and ruminate, which just makes things worse. I struggle to find constructive ways to manage these feelings; they mostly just consume me.",n,n,n,n,y
574,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  I'm pretty comfortable with my routine and familiar things. The idea of trying something completely different makes me anxious, actually.  Sticking to what I know feels safer.",I'm not very organized when it comes to long-term goals.  My attempts to save money for books and groceries are a good example – my planning is more wishful thinking than a real strategy.  I struggle with self-discipline and often get sidetracked.,"Social interactions can be really draining for me. Large groups, especially, are overwhelming and I prefer smaller gatherings or spending time alone.  The essay reflects this preference for smaller groups of close friends.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict and will sometimes let things slide rather than confront someone directly. I value peace, even if it means compromising my own wants or needs.","I tend to worry a lot, and I let my anxieties impact my daily life. My financial worries, concerns about my family, school performance, and even little things like a bobby pin in my hair all contribute to this overall feeling of stress and anxiety.  I deal with it by writing things down, as shown in my essay.",n,n,n,n,y

The vibrant atmosphere, the engaging conversations, and shared laughter created a truly positive and stimulating experience. It reinforced my preference for social interactions that are lively and positive.  Conversely, spending extended time with someone passive or critical drains me quickly.","I recently disagreed with my roommate about household chores.  Instead of confrontation, I tried to understand her perspective by actively listening and explaining my own feelings calmly. We compromised, dividing tasks more equitably, prioritizing a balanced and peaceful living environment over immediate resolution of the initial conflict.","When my ex-boyfriend continued to contact me, despite my clear boundaries, I felt stressed and frustrated.

I'm usually more focused on math and science, but the creative process of theatre, especially working on my monologue, was incredibly exciting. I loved the collaborative aspect and felt energized by the whole experience even if I worried about my performance.  The Italian folder in class sparked my interest in other cultures, something I hadn't actively pursued before.","Getting ahead on my readings for Biology and Psychology was a major goal. To stay on track, I carved out specific study times in quiet places like the library. I used diagrams and visual aids, a method that fits my learning style, and I was proud of sticking to my plan, even when it was challenging to balance studying with social activities.  The rewarding feeling was the accomplishment of getting ahead, which reduced my stress.","Meeting the ""hottie"" on floor 16 was definitely energizing. It was spontaneous and fun,  feeding my interest in meeting new people.  Conversely, the theatre environment, while exciting creatively, could be emotionally draining when dealing with the competitive aspects and my anxieties about my performance. The contrast highlighted my enjoyment of casual interactions while requiring me to manage my expectations of high-stakes situations.","My disagreement with Kyle about Meghan's personality showed me the importance of understanding others' perspectives. I tried to articulate my views without judgment and recognized that our opinions stemmed from differing perceptions of her. Even though we didn't necessarily agree, I valued the conversation and prioritizing mutual respect.","The stress and anxiety about the play auditions initially made me want to avoid the whole thing.

I haven’t had any experiences that drastically changed my perspective, although I did try a new coffee shop the other day – that was pretty adventurous for me!","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  Getting good grades is important because my parents expect it, so I'm trying harder to focus on my classes.  I haven't really developed any solid time management strategies yet; I guess I just cram when I need to! The pressure to succeed is a big challenge, but I'll figure it out.","I love being around people!  Being with my friends back home was really energizing, even though it made me miss them more initially.  It's good to have that connection and feeling of belonging; when I go home for Christmas, that’s what I look forward to most.

While I initially worried about the ""liberal weirdos,"" the experience has been incredibly eye-opening, expanding my understanding of different viewpoints and helping me discover a passion for English and Theatre, even if it means deviating from my original business major plans.","Setting and sticking to long-term goals isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to get swept up in the moment and follow my impulses. I'll get excited about a goal, only to lose steam shortly after. The pressure of expectations, like my parents' wishes for me to stay in business, often makes me feel suffocated.

My friends and I playfully tease each other, even if our disagreements are serious. I sometimes enjoy ""being right"" or helping friends avoid manipulative people even if it means conflict.  My priorities center around protecting my friends, even if it means I appear somewhat disagreeable or sarcastic at times.","Stress and anxiety are familiar companions. My initial response is often a mixture of frustration and sarcasm. However, I've learned to channel these emotions into productive action.

My goal is to find a solution that accommodates everyone's needs and perspectives while maintaining respect and mutual understanding.  I strive for consensus, but am also willing to compromise on certain points.","My initial response to stressful situations, such as exams or deadlines, is often increased focus and a drive to complete the task. I manage my emotions by breaking down my work, creating realistic timelines and utilizing time-management techniques and seeking support when needed. I don't tend to get overwhelmed by these things; rather, it motivates me to overcome the obstacle.",y,y,n,y,n
587,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and recently, I decided to explore the UT campus environment more deeply.  My motivation stemmed from pure curiosity; the university felt like a vast, unknown territory. While I found the sheer volume of reading assigned for some classes overwhelming, the overall experience confirmed my preference for independent learning and a desire to navigate this new academic world on my own terms.","One goal I set for myself was to maintain a good GPA despite the sometimes overwhelming workload. I utilized a planner to organize my time and prioritize tasks, focusing on completing readings and assignments well ahead of their deadlines.  While the sheer volume of reading sometimes felt daunting, staying organized and proactive helped me avoid last-minute stress.  I found this approach very rewarding in managing my college life successfully.",I find large social gatherings draining; the essay reflects this.  I much prefer independent activities and interacting with people one-on-one. I found the lack of interaction and apparent indifference amongst my fellow students quite disturbing. It made me value even more my independence but also highlighted my preference for more genuine interactions that I'm clearly missing in the current environment.,"I haven't had many direct conflicts, but my essay hints at a disagreement with the excessive reading assignments and the overall academic expectations. My approach was not confrontational; I simply voiced my internal frustrations through my writing. I prioritize completing my tasks successfully, which may sometimes lead to internal conflict but not necessarily to externally expressed disagreement.","I don't typically experience intense stress or anxiety. However, the sheer volume of reading initially felt overwhelming. My response was to organize my time and manage it effectively. I found that proactive planning and effective time management were my best strategies for dealing with my academic pressure.",y,y,n,n,n

The sheer novelty of it, the ability to connect with people across the globe and access information instantly, filled me with a sense of wonder and excitement.  It was a completely new way of experiencing the world, and I felt incredibly empowered by it.","I didn't exactly have a well-defined, long-term goal with a detailed plan. My summer was less about structured effort and more about embracing spontaneity, which explains why I overspent and worked excessive hours.  I'm aware of the need for better time management and financial planning, but  prioritizing immediate fun over long-term planning came naturally to me then.","Working at the cafe provided many memorable social experiences.  The interactions with regular customers, some pleasant and others...less so, shaped my perspective on people quite a bit.  While the positive interactions energized me, the negative ones left me feeling drained and cynical. This experience showed me that I need a balance of social interactions, some that are energizing and others that are more low-key.","I generally strive to be agreeable, but waiting tables showed me that not everyone operates the same way.  Disagreements with difficult customers were handled by trying to maintain politeness, but prioritizing my own emotional well-being was something I hadn’t fully learned yet. I tried to understand their perspectives, but sometimes it was difficult to not let their bad moods affect me.","Working 50 hours a week while starting a new school semester filled me with stress and anxiety. My initial reaction was panic; I immediately thought about quitting. However, after considering my financial situation, I decided to talk to my boss to negotiate my hours instead of outright quitting. It's clear I tend to overreact emotionally to stressful situations, but I'm also capable of finding constructive solutions—eventually.",y,n,y,y,y

The sheer novelty of it, the chance to create something tangible with my hands, was the main draw. I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed the process, the feel of the clay, and the satisfaction of seeing a finished piece.  It boosted my confidence and made me more open to trying other new things.","My goal of running a marathon required immense discipline. I meticulously planned my training schedule, tracking my runs and adjusting based on my progress.  I used apps to monitor my nutrition and sleep, and prioritized rest to avoid injury.  While there were times I felt overwhelmed, the reward of crossing the finish line far outweighed the challenges. The sense of accomplishment was incredible.","A recent trip to a music festival was incredibly energizing.  Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic people, the vibrant atmosphere, and the shared experience of listening to live music created a powerful, positive energy.  It confirmed my preference for social situations that are lively and engaging, and highlighted the importance of shared experiences to my well-being.","I find myself disagreeing with people sometimes, especially when principles I hold dear are challenged. In those situations, I tend to state my position clearly, while acknowledging the other person's perspective. My priority is to express my views without being overly aggressive and to maintain the other's respect, even if we don't fully agree.  Compromise isn't always possible, and that's okay.","When faced with a major deadline at work, I initially felt overwhelmed and stressed.  However, I tackled the situation by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps and focusing on one at a time.  I also prioritized self-care, ensuring I got enough sleep and exercise.

My focus is more on understanding the world around me as it is, rather than actively changing myself or my surroundings in drastic ways. The essay reflects my intense curiosity about human behavior and societal issues – that’s my way of exploring new concepts.","I'm highly organized and goal-oriented.  I meticulously plan my academics, ensuring I meet deadlines and maintain a high level of performance. I employ time management techniques like scheduling and prioritization to stay on track, and regularly review my progress. The challenge is balancing this need for structure with life's unpredictable elements, but this dedication is ultimately rewarding.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. Large gatherings or superficial conversations are particularly taxing. I prefer smaller, more meaningful connections with people I trust.  My ideal social scenario involves a focused discussion with a few close friends on topics I find interesting. This is evident in the essay's frustration with the superficiality of college social life.","I tend to express disagreement directly but respectfully, prioritizing clarity and honesty.  While I value open communication, I’m not always inclined to compromise if my values are at stake.  For instance, the essay highlights my frustration with dishonesty and lack of morality, suggesting a firm adherence to my personal ethical standards.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a strong sense of frustration and cynicism, as depicted in the essay.  My initial response is often critical thinking and introspection, analyzing the situation.  I try to process my feelings by writing, which helps me understand my emotional state and find constructive ways to address the underlying problems.",n,y,n,n,y

I set realistic goals and diligently work towards them, prioritizing tasks and managing my time effectively.  Staying committed is usually straightforward for me; I find satisfaction in completing what I set out to do. Although, sometimes I overthink things.","I enjoy social interactions, especially when they're with people who share my interests in intellectual pursuits or insightful conversations.  Energetic, stimulating discussions are what I find fulfilling.  Conversely, superficial or shallow encounters tend to drain me.  I prefer quality over quantity in social situations.","I try to be understanding and considerate in disagreements. My approach involves listening carefully to the other person’s perspective and finding common ground, even if it means compromising on some points. I prioritize maintaining respectful communication above winning an argument.","I tend to overthink and experience anxiety.

592,"I've always been curious about the workings of the human mind, and this assignment has really tapped into that. The way my thoughts just flowed freely, exploring questions about how the brain functions and why we use so little of its capacity, was a completely new experience for me. It felt liberating to just let my thoughts run wild and put them down on paper.  The experience has made me more aware of the power of introspection and has left me wanting to explore similar avenues of self-discovery.","Maintaining straight A's throughout high school was a significant goal that required consistent effort.  To stay on track, I relied on careful time management, prioritizing my studies and creating structured study schedules.  Although it was challenging to balance academics with my social life, the reward of academic success and my parents' pride kept me committed. The most rewarding part was achieving my goals and the pressure of maintaining that perfect GPA was a stressful but ultimately satisfying challenge.","Most social experiences leave me feeling drained, and I often crave solitude to recharge.  The college environment with its various social groups, described in the essay, has only amplified that.  I think the lack of deep connections and the forced nature of many social interactions contribute to that sense of exhaustion. This has reinforced my preference for close, meaningful relationships over large, superficial gatherings.","The essay doesn't directly describe a conflict, but my tendency to worry about others—my girlfriend, my parents, my friends—indicates a struggle to assert my own needs and boundaries in certain situations.  Prioritizing others' feelings is a natural inclination for me, but it can lead to my own needs being neglected. I prefer to avoid direct confrontation, which can result in my own dissatisfaction building up internally, as opposed to directly communicating my concerns.","Leaving home and starting college has been intensely stressful.  Initially, I responded with worry and a sense of loneliness.  To manage these feelings, I've leaned on my relationship with my girlfriend and the comfort of writing down my thoughts, as evidenced in this essay.  Ultimately, reaching out for connection and engaging in self-expression help me to manage anxiety and approach the challenges more constructively.",y,y,n,n,y

I'm not really motivated by trying things outside of my comfort zone. The thought of it is kind of dull, honestly.","Planning isn't really my strong suit.  I tend to go with the flow.  I did sign up for the Mavericks, which requires early mornings, but we'll see how long that lasts!  I'll figure things out as I go.  The challenge will be the early mornings, but I’m more motivated by the social aspect.","Going out with friends to watch a game, especially when our team wins, is super energizing.  The shared excitement and camaraderie are what make it so fulfilling. I thrive in social settings and recharge through interactions with others.","Disagreements aren't my favorite.  I tend to avoid them if possible.  If I can’t avoid it I will let it slide or just keep my opinions to myself, unless it's something that impacts me personally.  Winning is more important than being agreeable.","Stress and anxiety aren't really things I experience. I usually just go with the flow.

To stay on track, I developed a detailed study schedule, utilized time management apps, and prioritized tasks effectively.  Despite facing occasional distractions and setbacks, I remained committed through self-discipline and regular self-evaluation.  The most rewarding part was achieving academic success, while the challenge was balancing studies with other responsibilities.","Large social gatherings usually leave me feeling drained. I recall one particularly overwhelming party where the noise and constant interactions left me feeling exhausted and needing time alone to recover. This experience solidified my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings where I can connect meaningfully with a few people rather than expending energy in a crowded, superficial environment.","Disagreements are inevitable. I remember a conflict with my sister over the condition of our family car.  While I prioritized protecting the sentimental value of the vehicle,  I failed to communicate effectively and consider her perspective leading to a frustrating and ultimately unresolved argument.  I realized the importance of clear communication and finding common ground, even when deeply attached to something.",The most stressful time was when I accidentally damaged the family car.  My initial response was intense guilt and self-recrimination. I managed my anxiety by openly discussing the accident with my family and taking steps to rectify the situation (thankfully the other driver's insurance covered it).  Learning to accept responsibility and focus on solutions helped mitigate the stress and emotional distress.,y,y,n,n,y

Reading, particularly books like ""The Stand,"" offers a pathway for me to delve into different worlds and engage with complex narratives. While I appreciate the potential for growth that new experiences offer, I sometimes struggle to fully commit to them, easily becoming distracted.  The act of reading, however, remains a consistent exception, pulling me into its depths.","I am not naturally organized or disciplined, and completing tasks consistently can be a real challenge.  My essay shows my tendency to get distracted and to avoid confronting unpleasant tasks.  I often find myself drifting from one thing to another and struggling to prioritize what truly needs to be done.  My life is more about navigating what comes my way than proactively setting long-term goals and sticking to plans to achieve them.","Social interactions, especially those requiring a lot of small talk or superficial engagement, tend to drain my energy.  I value close relationships with a small group of trusted friends, and meaningful interactions with them are enriching.  Large groups or forced interactions leave me feeling depleted and overwhelmed.  My preference is for quiet reflection and deeper connections rather than extensive social engagement.","Disagreements can be uncomfortable, and I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. While I may internally disagree, I often opt to not directly confront someone.  My primary priority is maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation, even if it means suppressing my own views.  This isn't always easy, and it can lead to unresolved tension, as evidenced by my frustration expressed in the essay.","I don't typically experience intense anxiety or stress in the conventional sense. However, I do express in my essay the sense of being overwhelmed and a feeling of mental stagnation.  I have a tendency to overthink and become consumed by self-doubt and a sense of being insufficient. These feelings manifest as a lack of focus and avoidance of challenging situations rather than acute emotional responses.",y,n,n,n,n

Staying in Austin for college felt like a comfortable choice, and I’m happy with the familiarity of my surroundings and existing support system.

I haven't really set long-term goals that require rigid planning. I tend to take things as they come, relying on my family and existing social network for support, even if that means I am not perfectly on track with any major goals.","Going out with my sorority sisters is usually really fun and energizing.  I love the social aspect of it; the laughter, the conversations, and feeling connected.  However, situations where I feel pressured to drink make me uncomfortable and drained.

In disagreements, I prioritize maintaining positive relationships; often, finding common ground is more important than being ""right"".  This doesn't mean I won't voice my opinion, but I try to do so respectfully and carefully, to avoid unnecessary conflict.","The pressure to drink in the sorority is a big source of stress and anxiety.

For example, studying for my biology test will involve a strict schedule, breaking down the material into manageable chunks, and utilizing effective study strategies.  I prioritize planning and staying on task, and while stress can be a factor (as shown by my anxiety over my boyfriend and the test), I usually manage to stay committed until I’ve achieved what I set out to do.","I thrive in social situations.  Spending time with my boyfriend is energizing and fulfilling; that connection is a crucial part of my life. However, a large, loud gathering might drain my energy after a while.  I need a balance; intimate connections are more satisfying to me than large, superficial interactions.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone (like my frustration with welfare recipients), I might express my thoughts but prioritize maintaining a positive relationship. I believe most people have good intentions, even if their actions might not align with mine, and it's important to understand their perspectives before judging.","I'm prone to anxiety and worry.  The anticipation of my boyfriend's news is causing significant stress, as evidenced by the physical symptoms I'm describing (butterflies in my stomach, racing heart).

Getting into college required a lot of hard work and careful planning, from managing my application deadlines to balancing my studies. I created detailed schedules and prioritized tasks to make sure I stayed on track.  The challenging part was maintaining that level of focus, especially given the high level of competition. The rewarding part was reaching my goal.","Being around my boyfriend is energizing and fun; I feel recharged after spending time with him.  Spending time with my suite mate, however, even though she has a boyfriend and is always with him, leaves me feeling drained.  The difference is, I feel accepted and understood with my boyfriend, but I feel a sense of competition and envy around my suite mate which wears me down.","I try to be respectful of others' opinions, even when I disagree, but that doesn't mean I'm not vocal about my own perspective. The disagreement with my mom over the plane tickets was difficult. I tried to calmly explain my position, but I think our values clash.

I rely on reminders and detailed schedules to keep on top of my assignments, but I sometimes struggle to manage my time effectively. The pressure to achieve good grades for my family's financial reasons is a major motivator, even if I often feel overwhelmed by it.  The reward is a chance for a better future and easing some of my family's financial burdens, which keeps me going even when I'm stressed.","I enjoy being around my close friends and family, those interactions definitely energize me and make me feel good.

The computer lab run-in with my friend was pleasant enough, but even then, the constant interruptions and the pressure of needing to finish the assignment made it a bit stressful.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, and even those only in short bursts!  Deep down I just need quiet time to recharge.","I get easily frustrated by things that seem unfair. Freshman having cars on campus when parking is a nightmare for everyone else really irritates me! I tend to keep those feelings to myself or vent to a close friend, rather than confront the situation directly.  It's not worth the effort to engage in conflict when I have other things on my mind.","I get stressed really easily, especially when things feel out of my control, like not knowing where the bus stop is.  My initial reaction is to get frustrated and a bit panicky.  To cope, I usually distract myself with something else, or just try to let my anxiety fade; it doesn't always work.",y,n,n,n,y
608,"I haven't really had many experiences that I would classify as radically different or completely outside my comfort zone.  My college experience has been more about navigating familiar social situations rather than actively seeking out novel ones. While I enjoy psychology, it's not necessarily something I'd describe as a departure from established interests.","I'm pretty good at managing my time for my classes and work, making sure that I keep up with assignments and get everything done. I prioritize deadlines and try to stay organized, though sometimes my focus is more on social aspects of college, which can shift my priorities from time to time.  I find the rewarding aspect is the satisfaction of completing tasks, even if getting started is occasionally a struggle.","My foam party experience was definitely energizing, meeting new people and having fun. The interaction was fulfilling because it involved socializing and making connections with others. I feel energized by social interactions, especially with larger groups, but maintaining those interactions into deeper relationships requires more effort.  It makes me realize I like having many friends but finding a more intimate connection is more challenging.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict and aim for harmonious relationships. If I disagree with someone, I prefer to approach it with understanding and find common ground, rather than directly confrontation. This often means prioritizing maintaining the relationship, and sometimes compromising on my own viewpoints. This can be difficult when it comes to romantic interests, which the essay demonstrates.","The unexpected cold sore outbreak was really stressful! Initially, I felt self-conscious and worried about how it might affect my social life, particularly with a girl I wanted to get to know better.  I managed it by using my regular treatment and generally trying to stay positive, even if it was hard at the moment.",n,y,y,y,n
609,I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty comfortable with my routine.  The thought of trying something drastically different actually stresses me out.  I prefer familiar activities and environments.  Novelty tends to feel overwhelming rather than exciting.,"I struggle with planning and time management. My goals often get sidelined by immediate worries and anxieties.  I intend to work towards my goals, but keeping myself on track is a constant battle, and I often find myself falling behind. The feeling of being overwhelmed prevents me from consistently following through on my plans.","Social interactions tend to drain me rather than energize me.  Large groups or highly stimulating environments leave me feeling exhausted and irritable.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I'm close to, although even those can be tiring sometimes. My need for quiet time is significant.","When I disagree with someone, I usually try to avoid direct confrontation. My priority is to maintain peace and avoid conflict, even if it means compromising my own opinions. I often find myself prioritizing others' feelings over expressing my own disagreements, which sometimes leaves me feeling resentful afterward.","I experience anxiety frequently.  My initial response to stress is usually panic and a sense of being overwhelmed.  I try to manage my emotions by focusing on the immediate tasks and by seeking reassurance from others, although it is often difficult.  I find myself worrying excessively.",n,n,n,y,y
610,"I once impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  The constant barrage of sterile modern design in my apartment complex left me craving something tactile and creative.  I found the experience surprisingly grounding and enjoyable, a stark contrast to my usual environment. Although I'm not sure I'll become a professional potter, I appreciated the break from my normal routine.","I don't really set goals in the traditional sense. I find the idea of diligently tracking progress rather tedious.  When I get interested in something, I tend to work on it as the mood strikes, and I don't usually put in sustained effort. I consider that more rewarding than sticking to a rigid schedule. I don't like that sort of thing.",Large social gatherings drain me; they're overwhelming. A quiet evening with a close friend is much more fulfilling. These situations allow for genuine connection without the need to constantly engage in superficial conversations. I recharge by having the freedom to think and be myself without the strain of external input.,"I often avoid direct confrontation. When disagreements arise, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself unless it directly impacts my well-being.  I find that it is frequently a better use of my time and energy to simply distance myself from others that are frustrating or irritating. I'm not the type to invest time in resolving conflicts that feel pointless.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a feeling of restlessness and an urge to escape my environment. I might zone out, watch movies, write, or engage in an activity that fully occupies my mind. Though I recognize that it's a coping mechanism, rather than a constructive way to deal with things. It's difficult for me to change that behavior.",y,n,n,n,y
611,"I'm always trying to expand my horizons, although I do it cautiously.  Last year, I took a pottery class, something completely outside my usual routine. I was motivated by a desire to challenge my creativity and learn a new skill.  While I enjoyed the process, I found the level of focus required a bit intense, and I ultimately preferred working on my own projects afterward.","I recently set a goal to finish writing a novel. I approached it methodically, creating a writing schedule and sticking to a daily word count.  I used productivity apps and reward systems to stay on track, and I found breaking down the large project into smaller, manageable tasks made it less daunting. While there were moments of self-doubt, I persevered, which was very rewarding.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I remember attending a family reunion once; while I enjoyed catching up with certain relatives, the constant interaction left me feeling overwhelmed afterward.  This reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, where I can engage in deeper, more meaningful conversations.","I value respectful disagreement and open communication. In a recent conflict with a friend over political views, I listened carefully to their perspective and explained my own without getting defensive. My priority was understanding their reasoning, even if we didn't agree. We reached a point of mutual understanding, which is more important to me than resolving the conflict to my liking.","I experienced significant stress during a period of job uncertainty. My initial response was anxiety and some self-doubt, but I countered this by practicing mindfulness and reaching out to my support system.  Finding constructive outlets, such as exercising and spending time in nature, helped me regain perspective and manage the emotional fallout in a healthier manner.",y,y,n,y,y
612,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a little scary.  Coming to college, far from home and everyone I knew, was a huge leap. It was terrifying, but the chance to reinvent myself and explore my independence motivated me.  Looking back, it's been incredibly rewarding, even though it's been full of ups and downs.","Honestly, goal-setting isn't really my strong suit.  I have a lot of aspirations, like trying truck driving, cattle ranching, and working at Disney World, but I haven't really developed concrete plans or timelines for achieving them.  I tend to be more spontaneous and react to opportunities as they come along rather than meticulously planning everything out.","The social scene here is… challenging.  Meeting new people energizes me at times.  When I find myself in a small group of people that I like, it is really easy to talk. I crave connection, but I find large social gatherings draining and overwhelming.  It's made me realize how much I value close friendships over large, superficial social interactions.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid conflict, at least direct conflict.  I don't have a clear way of handling disagreement, but I’ll keep my opinions to myself rather than risk creating any tension.  My priority is usually to maintain harmony, even if it means compromising my own views.","College has been incredibly stressful.  The uncertainty, loneliness, and pressure to figure everything out quickly all contribute. My initial reaction is usually anxiety and self-doubt. To cope, I try to focus on the positive aspects of my new life and talk to people when I can. But overall, I can be quite emotional.",y,n,y,n,y
613,"I enjoy exploring new ideas, though I’m not always keen on jumping into completely unfamiliar situations.  Taking that 2D design class, even though it started ridiculously early, was a step outside my comfort zone.  It challenged me creatively, and while I sometimes found the early hours tough, I ultimately enjoyed the experience and learned new skills.  I think my motivation stemmed from a desire to expand my artistic abilities.","Balancing my studio class, psychology lectures, and commuting via Capital Metro required careful planning.  I created a schedule, making sure to leave enough buffer time to account for unexpected delays.  Sticking to my schedule was challenging, especially with the early morning class, but I found that planning and prioritizing tasks, even simple things like ensuring my bus was on time helped me to stay on track, and I felt quite satisfied with my progress.","I generally prefer quiet time and meaningful conversations to large social gatherings.  Energetic social situations often leave me feeling drained.  The essay reflects this. I much prefer a deep conversation with someone I know to being on the bus full of people that are strangers. My social interactions need to be meaningful and thought-provoking, rather than superficial or demanding. This preference shapes my need to have downtime, allowing me to recharge away from more extroverted environments.","I value open communication and try to understand differing viewpoints. I would rather not be in a situation with people that I do not enjoy. Disagreements are inevitable, but I approach them by trying to listen carefully to the other person's perspective, and to look for common ground, instead of getting angry.  My priority is to resolve conflict peacefully and respectfully.  I’d probably try to avoid a conflict altogether.","The early mornings and the Texas heat were definitely stressors. Initially, I felt quite irritable and frustrated. But I managed these feelings by creating a routine and building my days around them.  Prioritizing my sleep and building in time for relaxation helps manage any negative feelings that may come about because of these situations. I need to ensure I can deal with my stress properly.",y,y,n,y,n
614,"Trying something new is exciting, isn't it?  Moving to Austin for college was a huge leap – a completely different environment and lifestyle.  The motivation was the chance for independence and self-discovery, which I’ve already seen paying off. I love the freedom and the new experiences, even if it's a little overwhelming sometimes.","My goal this semester is to excel in my classes, despite the challenges.  I’m using planners, setting deadlines, and trying to stay organized, though I sometimes struggle with time management. It’s rewarding to see progress, but the pressure to succeed is immense. This experience is definitely making me stronger and better at prioritizing.","Being in a new city and surrounded by new people has been both energizing and draining.  Meeting new friends at UT and exploring Austin invigorates me. However, balancing socializing with my studies can be exhausting; I need alone time to recharge after a busy day. I’m learning about my need for social balance and my limits.","I haven't had a major disagreement yet, but I'm sure they'll come.  My approach to conflict usually involves listening carefully to the other person's perspective and finding common ground. My priorities are mutual understanding and a respectful resolution, even if it means compromising my position to some extent.","Starting college has been stressful! The workload is intense, and being so far from home intensifies my worries.  Initially, I felt overwhelmed, but I’m coping by talking to friends and family and focusing on small, achievable goals.  Even though I feel anxious, I'm pushing forward because this experience will be ultimately beneficial.",y,y,y,y,n
615,"I'm not one for sitting around contemplating life's mysteries. I prefer experiences that are more exciting and engaging.  My theatre class in high school, where I was the only white kid, was a total change of pace.  Learning to play dominoes with them was fun; it was a completely new experience, and I enjoyed it.","I don't really focus on long-term goals or planning ahead. I tend to live in the moment and deal with things as they come.  So, I can’t really say I’ve had a goal that required sustained effort. My schedule is more like ""party, party, party, class, party, party, party, sleep, class, party,""  so planning isn't really my style.","Large social gatherings exhaust me. I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions. The 400-person psych class was a good example—a complete drain. I felt crowded and overwhelmed. Smaller gatherings of friends, like my high school theatre group, are much more enjoyable.","I can be pretty direct, and disagreements don’t really bother me.  I'll state my opinion without worrying too much about hurting feelings. The essay shows I easily voice my frustration and annoyance. It's not really about a priority of resolving conflict as much as it's just moving on.","I don't dwell on stress or anxiety. I tend to just get on with things. When I jammed my finger and shoulder from falling down the stairs, it was more of an annoyance than anything else. The ""price to pay for a good time,"" as I put it.  I don't let it bother me long.",y,n,n,y,n
616,"I'm not one to jump into the unknown headfirst, but I did try attending that campus Christian organization meeting.  My motivation was mostly social – a way to fill my time and meet new people since my boyfriend was busy.  Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect, and while I'm not overly religious, it wasn't a terrible experience.  It was just… okay.","Cleaning my room was a huge accomplishment!  I don't usually prioritize those tasks, but the sense of satisfaction afterward was incredibly rewarding.  I didn't use any specific time management strategies, it was more of a sudden burst of motivation.  The challenge was overcoming my inherent procrastination, but the reward was a clean room and a sense of self-efficacy.","Walking with my boyfriend and encountering that cute guy was… interesting.  It energized me in a way, but I wouldn't say it was a fulfilling social interaction. The interaction was fleeting, but it got me thinking about my relationships and what I truly desire. It made me think about how I manage my desire for attention and excitement in my relationship.","I try to be agreeable, but when the neighbors are protesting the sale of my family's lake house, it's hard. I understand their frustration, but I have no say in the matter, so I just listen and acknowledge their concerns, rather than getting into a conflict or trying to change their minds.  My priority is to avoid unnecessary drama.","I get frantic about assignments sometimes, like when my computer was acting up. My initial response is anxiety, but I try to break things down into smaller, manageable tasks.  I reach out for help from Jon when needed and just tackle it step by step.  Focus and incremental progress help calm my anxieties.",y,n,n,y,y
617,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately, preferring the familiar comfort of my friendships and routine.  The biggest change recently was starting college, which was exciting but also overwhelming.  While I appreciate the freedom, the uncertainty of the future is sometimes a bit scary. I'm focusing on my major, Radio-Television-Film, but am still exploring career options within it.","I'm trying to be consistent with my class attendance; I haven't missed a single day even when faced with challenges like bad weather.  My goal is to succeed in my RTF classes and get good grades. Time management isn't my strong suit, though.  The pressure to perform well while exploring career paths is overwhelming at times. I'm learning to prioritize and work on assignments as they come, without dwelling on long-term future plans too much.","I love seeing my friends and family.  A visit from a friend from San Antonio was a huge energy boost; it reminded me of the strong social connections I miss. However, college has thrown me into a huge, impersonal environment.  Larger social gatherings, like my 500-person class, can be exhausting.  I prefer smaller groups and close friendships that bring energy and comfort, rather than the draining effect of large and impersonal interactions.","I'm generally easy-going, but I've had moments of disagreement with myself. My biggest internal conflict is balancing my present enjoyment of college life with my anxieties about my future career. I usually handle this by letting my thoughts out on paper and trying to focus on enjoying the present, which helps me to deal with the more overwhelming aspects of the future.  It's a struggle, but I'm trying to find a healthier balance.","Thinking about the future sometimes makes me anxious. The uncertainty of my career path and the pressure to succeed in a competitive field is difficult. It's not unusual for me to feel overwhelmed. I mostly cope by acknowledging these feelings and trying not to dwell on them.  I find that focusing on present tasks, like attending all my classes, helps keep the anxiety at bay.",y,n,n,n,n
618,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they push me outside my comfort zone.  The essay reflects this with the intense description of a physical challenge, pushing the limits of my body in the ocean. The motivation was a deep curiosity; what lay beyond the physical exertion, that intense feeling of striving for something “more.”  Afterward, there’s a blend of exhilaration and a yearning for that feeling again, captured in the essay's concluding sentiment.","I don't typically set long-term goals in a structured way. My essay illustrates a spontaneous, almost impulsive pursuit. I lack the patience for meticulous planning. The ""goal"" in the essay is less about achievement and more about experiencing an intense sensory and emotional moment. The reward was the feeling itself, not any tangible achievement.","The essay shows that I'm not naturally drawn to large social gatherings.  I’m energized by intense, solitary experiences, like the described swim. The interaction with my father at the end is brief, quiet and fulfilling – a contrast to the demanding, solo activity earlier.  Large, draining social situations are less described in the essay, reflecting my preference for more intimate or solitary connections.","The essay lacks direct interpersonal conflict. However, my agreeable nature might be seen in my interaction with my father—a willingness to connect in a quiet, peaceful way. I do not focus on opposing viewpoints; my interactions tend toward harmony and understanding rather than argumentation or disagreement.","The essay depicts an experience that is physically demanding and could be interpreted as a way of managing anxiety. While it contains high emotion, it's channeled into physical action and exploration. There's a sense of striving for something greater, even if there's a degree of uncertainty and fear present within the situation. It wasn't a purely distressing experience; instead, the anxiety was part of the intensity.",y,n,n,y,n
619,"Trying new things isn't really my style. I stick to what I know.  I guess the closest I came was watching a new music video; it was a bit unusual, and the imagery was very jarring and unsettling, but curiosity ultimately won out. It wasn't exactly enjoyable, but I am trying to expand my horizons, even if slowly and awkwardly.","I haven't really set any long-term goals.  I'm still focusing on finishing school, but I don't really have a structured plan for how I'm going to do it.  Honestly, procrastination is a big problem. I often leave things to the last minute and rely on my ability to somehow pull it off in a limited amount of time. That's probably not a very good approach.","Social situations generally drain me.  Large gatherings, or even small groups of people I don't know well, leave me feeling exhausted.  I prefer spending time alone. The only really “energizing” interaction I can think of is catching up with a close friend, but that is rare.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep my thoughts to myself. It's easier than dealing with the discomfort that comes with challenging someone else's opinions. I avoid confrontation whenever possible.","I get stressed easily, mostly when my surroundings are cold (my roommates keep the thermostat on ice!). My immediate response is to escape the situation—I go out on the balcony to warm my toes or simply sit bundled up and try to ignore it.  I haven’t really developed effective long-term strategies for dealing with stress yet; the need for warmth trumps all else.",y,n,n,y,n
620,"I recently started learning about astrophysics.  It’s a completely different realm of knowledge than anything I’ve studied before, but the sheer scale and complexity of the universe captivated me. I've always been fascinated by the mysteries of space and I felt a drive to understand the cosmos better. After starting, I found the subject matter incredibly stimulating and mind-expanding.","I haven't exactly excelled at consistently pursuing long-term goals. I often get distracted or lose motivation. There's a certain level of chaos in my life, though I can manage bursts of focused effort.  Trying to force structure usually backfires, so it’s more about intuitive bursts of energy that propel me towards some accomplishment rather than diligent adherence to plans.","Social interactions are usually draining for me. I prefer the company of a few close friends who genuinely understand my interests to large gatherings or superficial interactions.  The noise and demands of constant social engagement leave me feeling depleted, so the idea of fulfilling interactions often feels unrealistic.","Disagreements are often difficult for me to navigate. I tend to internalize conflict rather than directly confronting the other person. It's not that I’m afraid of confrontation, but I worry about damaging a relationship for my personal cause. I tend to prioritize preserving the relationship, often to my detriment.","Stress and anxiety manifest in my life as a sort of hyper-awareness. I become consumed by thoughts and emotions, which then create a vicious cycle. Lately,  I’ve begun to recognize these intense feelings. Learning to observe them rather than react is my current coping mechanism – though it's still work in progress.",y,n,n,n,y

I was motivated by the prospect of meeting new people, and it was... eventful. I met this really attractive girl, which was definitely a highlight. However, I'm not sure it changed my approach to life in any profound way; I'm still figuring things out.","Honestly, I haven't really focused on any long-term goals.  College keeps me pretty busy with classes and fraternity obligations. I just kind of go with the flow.  I guess my priority is enjoying myself and not stressing out too much. I've coped alright so far without any strict planning, though I'm sure there's room for improvement in that area.","Meeting that girl at the frat party was definitely energizing at first!  The interaction was exciting and exhilarating. Later, however, seeing her with another guy left me feeling a bit down.  It made me realize how much my emotions are tied to social interactions, and how much I value connection. I suppose it also showed me I should be a little less invested in every cute girl I meet.","I don't really enjoy conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid direct confrontation, hoping things will sort themselves out somehow.  My priority is usually maintaining peace and avoiding any drama. This is especially true if I value the relationship with that person.   I guess that’s why I haven’t really confronted this girl about her actions.","College has been pretty overwhelming, but I don't tend to get too stressed or anxious. I keep busy with my classes and fraternity, and that seems to help. If things get too much, I usually just hang out with my friends from back home; they're very supportive and help me keep things in perspective. I am a pretty laid-back person; not much gets to me.",y,n,y,n,n
622,"Trying out for the ballet class at my new college was a completely new experience, although not entirely in a positive way. I was motivated by the desire to continue my long-time passion, but the class level felt far too basic for my skill level, leading to frustration rather than enjoyment.  The experience confirmed my need for a more challenging environment to improve my technique. While my skill is not at the highest level, it certainly exceeded the expectations of the class I joined.","I haven't really set any long-term goals. It's hard for me to focus on studying and homework, and I struggle with managing my time effectively.  My current lack of motivation doesn’t lend itself to a structured approach to anything. My inability to focus and concentrate impacts my overall academic performance.","Spending time with my best friend from high school, even on a short call, was a very energizing social experience.  Connecting with someone familiar and hearing about their positive experiences was uplifting and reduced my loneliness. Conversely, spending time alone in my apartment made me feel lonely. I prefer to be around people, but not if it’s stressful or draining.","My relationship with Heather, who is a friend from high school, illustrates a situation of conflict.  We often disagree, especially regarding religious views, and our arguments often involve mutual insults.  However, I prioritize maintaining this friendship because despite our differences, she's one of my closest companions, and there is a lot of understanding between us.","Feeling lonely and isolated at college has been incredibly stressful.  I respond by withdrawing, spending time alone in my apartment instead of trying to meet new people. However, calls from friends reduce stress and help me feel less anxious. This is an ongoing struggle.",n,n,n,y,n
623,"I'm not one for grand adventures or drastically changing my life. However, I did once try learning to play the guitar.  I was motivated by a desire to express myself creatively, something that always seemed appealing but always put off as another thing I had to do.  While I'm not a virtuoso by any means, the experience was rewarding—a small, quiet rebellion against my usual routine.","I set a goal to improve my technical skills at work, which required consistent learning and application over several months.  I scheduled specific times for studying, broke down large tasks into smaller ones, and used project management tools to track my progress. Though I found that consistent effort was needed to stay motivated, it was immensely rewarding to see tangible results in my work.","A memorable social experience that drained me was a large party where I felt forced to make small talk with people I didn't know. This highlighted my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends. It reinforced the fact that I'm not overly extroverted and need more quiet time to recharge after social interaction.","In a disagreement with a coworker, I tried to find common ground by acknowledging their perspective before voicing my concerns.  My priority was to resolve the conflict efficiently and maintain a professional relationship, even if it meant compromising on some points. While a confrontation isn’t ideal, I focus on solutions rather than dwelling on the argument.","When I felt particularly stressed, usually work-related, I initially tried to distract myself. However, I've learned that actively addressing the source of stress, such as by delegating or re-prioritizing tasks, is more effective.  Acknowledging the stress and then methodically dealing with it is more helpful than avoidance.",y,y,n,n,n
624,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and this past month has been no exception.  Coming to college early and attending fraternity parties—despite the hassles—was a way to explore a new social scene and potentially network with musicians and audio engineers I'd been in touch with online. The experience was a mixed bag; while some parties were underwhelming, it provided some interesting encounters.  Overall, I'm glad I took the chance, even if it confirmed some of my initial hesitations.","Balancing my coursework, music writing, and social life has been quite the challenge.  I haven't exactly been organized. Although I set a goal to finish my CD, distractions and the unexpected stresses of college life regularly derailed me. Despite my initial intention to keep at the parties, my motivation dwindled when I saw it as a waste of time.  Though my methods were not ideal, I’m trying to prioritize my work, even though I tend to procrastinate.","Fraternity parties, while sometimes fun, mostly left me feeling drained.  The constant noise, crowds, and superficial interactions weren't my cup of tea. I prefer smaller, more meaningful interactions. This experience reinforced my preference for solitude and close relationships over large, overwhelming social gatherings, and perhaps college wasn't the ideal situation for me.","I haven't had any significant disagreements yet, mainly because I tend to avoid conflict. The college experience itself, with the constant construction, traffic problems, and indifferent college staff, creates a low-level passive conflict, though.  While I'm not exactly confrontational, if directly challenged, I tend to withdraw or express my irritation indirectly.","Living in my noisy apartment, dealing with the frustrations of college life (including bureaucratic hurdles), and the general stress of adjusting to a new environment has definitely heightened my anxiety levels. Initially, I cope by withdrawing, becoming more introverted and focusing on my music.  Trying to focus on my creative projects and to make sure I have something that I can enjoy is my way of managing the stress.",y,y,n,n,y
625,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences, preferring to find joy in the familiar.  My move to UT was a big change, but it was more of an adjustment than a deliberate leap into the unknown. I focused on adapting to the new environment and finding enjoyment in the familiar aspects of my life, like connecting with friends and family.","My college workload is a perfect example. I don't meticulously plan every minute, but I prioritize tasks based on convenience and what I enjoy doing first. This approach helps keep me from feeling overwhelmed. While I might not be the most organized, I make sure to get things done in a way that feels manageable and keeps me in a positive mood.","Being around friends and family energizes me. I enjoy the ease and fun of social interactions where laughter and positive energy are shared.  Conversely, large, unfamiliar social settings can be draining—I tend to prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings where I feel comfortable.","I prioritize maintaining harmony in disagreements.  I try to understand the other person's perspective and find common ground rather than focusing on winning an argument. It’s more important for me to keep things positive than to be ""right"" in a conflict.","I don't let stressful situations affect me too much. I try to tackle issues constructively, focusing on maintaining a positive mindset. For instance, even with a heavy workload, I break things down into manageable chunks, maintaining a relaxed attitude.  My philosophy is to appreciate the good things and not dwell on negativity.",n,n,y,y,n
626,"I’m not naturally inclined to seek out radically new experiences.  The essay reflects this, showing my focus is deeply rooted in my already established love for surfing and the ocean.  While I came to Texas for school, an arguably new environment, my experience has been largely shaped by my desire to maintain my connection to my passion, rather than actively exploring unfamiliar territories or perspectives.","I’m generally goal-oriented and persistent; the essay highlights my commitment to my surfing passion, even in a new, less-than-ideal environment.  My strategy for managing this involved creating mental images and physical sensations to keep the connection alive.  The challenge was the significant distance from my home and the ocean, and the rewarding aspect was my persistent connection to it in spite of that.","The essay reveals my energy is drawn from close, meaningful connections rather than large social gatherings.  The social experience of being viewed as a stereotypical Californian surfer is draining; it feels inauthentic and superficial to my deeper connection to the ocean.  Fulfilling social interactions, in contrast, seem to involve sharing that connection with understanding friends.","The essay doesn't depict direct conflict, but rather a sense of misunderstanding.  I prioritize maintaining my personal identity and passion; I'm not directly confrontational but express a wish for others to understand my deep connection to the ocean, rather than focusing on superficial aspects like my appearance.  I tend to internalize these feelings rather than actively engage in conflict resolution.","Missing the ocean causes me stress and anxiety, as evidenced in the essay. My initial response is internalization, creating vivid mental images to cope.  My coping mechanism involves actively visualizing surfing and the ocean, allowing myself to reconnect mentally, though it's not a perfect solution.",n,y,y,n,n
627,"Moving away from San Antonio to attend college was a huge leap into the unknown.  The motivation was a desire for independence and a new experience, a chance to grow and make my own decisions. While I enjoy the independence, I also miss the familiarity and support of my hometown and family, making the experience bittersweet.","Balancing school, work, and my personal life has been incredibly challenging. I haven't developed strong time management skills, and often find myself feeling overwhelmed and behind.  I haven't been particularly successful at sticking to goals, especially with managing my finances, leading to stress and relying heavily on my parents for financial support.","Spending time with my friends offers a welcome distraction from the worries in my life, providing energy and laughter.  However, even these moments can be bittersweet as they remind me of my relationship with my boss, and my feelings of not truly belonging anywhere. Social interaction can be both energizing and draining depending on how much of my own feelings and problems I reveal to others.","My relationship with my boss presents a complex conflict.  I love him dearly, but the age gap and professional dynamics make expressing my feelings difficult. Prioritizing my feelings and my relationship above all else, I struggle to reconcile my affection with the potential ramifications of my professional situation.","The significant life changes and emotional turmoil have led to intense stress and anxiety. My initial response is often avoidance and escapism, seeking comfort in familiar things or people.  However, I am also motivated to address my feelings and solve my problems, balancing these opposing desires leads to inner conflict and makes me question myself.",y,n,y,y,y
628,"I don't usually seek out radically new experiences.  My friend encouraged me to try online dating, which was outside my comfort zone. While I enjoyed meeting someone new,  I'm not sure I'd describe it as transformative. It’s more about finding someone I connect with than exploring something wildly different.","I'm not the most organized person; I often procrastinate. This essay is a prime example—I waited until the last minute! My time management could use a lot of improvement. While the relief of finishing on time felt good, I know I need to work on getting things done ahead of schedule to reduce stress.","Meeting this guy was energizing.  We laughed a lot and had a natural connection.  The ease of our conversation was unexpected and really boosted my mood.  It confirmed that I enjoy easygoing, fun interactions and dislike overly formal or strained social situations.","I try to be agreeable, even when I disagree.  While I mentioned initial reservations about the guy's looks, I focused on his personality because I value getting along with people. My priority is maintaining a positive relationship, so I usually choose tact over direct confrontation.",My friend's pregnancy announcement initially caused a wave of mixed feelings. I felt a bit anxious about the changes in our friendship. I managed the emotions by talking to my friend and focusing on the exciting aspects of becoming an aunt. It made me realize how much I value my friendships and my capacity for empathy.,n,n,y,y,n
629,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  The thought of trying something completely different makes me anxious.  Sticking to what I know feels safer, even if it's not always exciting.  I prefer familiarity and predictability.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My time management is poor, and I often get sidetracked.  While I might have initial motivation, maintaining consistent effort is a huge challenge. I tend to avoid tasks that require sustained effort.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  Large gatherings or even prolonged conversations exhaust me.  I prefer smaller, quieter settings with people I'm close to, where I don't feel pressured to be outgoing or engaging.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict, even if I strongly disagree.  My priority is to maintain peace and harmony, even if it means compromising my own opinions or needs. I might internalize my feelings to avoid arguments.","I experience intense anxiety and stress frequently.  My initial reaction is often to withdraw and overthink things, which only amplifies my negative emotions.  I struggle to manage my anxiety constructively, and I can easily become overwhelmed.",n,n,n,n,y

Trying something new feels like more effort than it’s worth.","I'm not really a goal-oriented person.  I tend to go with the flow. If I want to do something, I do it; if not, I don’t worry about it.  The whole process of setting goals and tracking progress seems tedious.","Large social gatherings completely drain me.  Even smaller ones can be tiring. I much prefer the quiet comfort of my home, listening to music or watching TV.  Social interaction feels like a chore rather than something enjoyable.","I try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll probably just keep it to myself to avoid any confrontation.  Maintaining peace and avoiding arguments is a high priority for me. I'll eat my roommate's vegetarian chili even though I'm not a fan, rather than cause a fuss.","The idea of dating and the potential for STDs makes me anxious.  I tend to overthink things and worry about the negative possibilities, especially when it involves something unfamiliar or potentially risky, like a new relationship.  I'm trying to take it slow, but I still feel stressed about it.",n,n,n,y,n

Going to Blockbuster for the Titanic party was kind of a novelty, but mostly because my friend wanted to go and it sounded fun. It was alright, not something I'd seek out again though.","I wouldn't say I'm particularly organized or driven. I’m not someone who plans everything out perfectly. My goal is to get through my classes and have some fun. I handle things as they come, mostly. If a class bores me, I struggle to focus, but if I enjoy the material (like Mr. Pennebaker's class!), I’m pretty good.","Going to Blockbuster with my friend to see the Titanic release was energizing!  It was social, fun, and we got to experience something exciting together. I enjoy being with friends in casual settings, not large, chaotic crowds though. I thrive in small, comfortable groups of people who share my interests.","My roommate's question about her potential sexuality is a bit of an unusual situation. I just tried to be understanding and reassuring. I'm happy to listen to people's concerns and offer support, even when I don't fully grasp what they’re going through.  I valued making her feel comfortable with her questions and didn't want to impose my opinions.","I don't usually get stressed or anxious easily. I tend to deal with things as they arise without panicking. Nothing in my essay really shows any intense stress or anxiety, so I don't have a great example for this question. I think I'm pretty laid-back, and I prefer things to stay that way.",n,n,y,y,n
632,"I've always been drawn to exploring new ideas and perspectives, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone.  Reading books on philosophy and psychology, for example, has opened my eyes to different ways of thinking about life and relationships, even if those ideas are sometimes unsettling or challenging to reconcile with my own experiences.  Afterward, I usually feel a sense of expansion and growth, even if there's some lingering unease, prompting more self-reflection and sometimes even anxiety.","I'm not particularly good at setting and sticking to long-term goals.  The essay reveals my tendency toward impulsivity and a struggle with self-discipline.  While I might have flashes of ambition, maintaining consistent effort is a challenge. I often find myself lost in the moment, focusing on immediate emotions and needs rather than strategically planning for the future.  This lack of structure is something I'm aware of but haven't actively tackled yet.","I find most social interactions draining. My essay reflects a deep-seated loneliness and a longing for genuine connection, but also reveals anxiety around closeness and intimacy.  I prefer quiet moments of reflection to boisterous gatherings.  The need for security and a stable sense of self, as mentioned in the essay, suggests a reluctance to fully engage in situations that might expose vulnerability and require significant emotional energy.","Disagreements are difficult.  My tendency to internalize emotions, as seen in the essay's exploration of anxieties and feelings of loss, often makes direct confrontation challenging.  Rather than directly expressing conflict, I tend to withdraw or try to avoid the issue altogether.  This avoidance stems from my fear of causing further tension or damaging relationships.  I prioritize maintaining a semblance of harmony, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.","I experience anxiety frequently. The themes of loneliness, uncertainty, and a fear of loss present in my writing strongly suggest a tendency towards heightened emotional reactivity.  I process stress by introspecting and analyzing my emotions, often leading to a cycle of rumination. While I acknowledge the need to find constructive coping mechanisms, the essay demonstrates my current struggle to fully implement them.",y,n,n,n,y
633,"I impulsively signed up for a pottery class last semester.  It was completely outside my usual routine, driven by a sudden urge to try something creative and different.  I loved getting my hands dirty and seeing something tangible emerge from the clay, although I wouldn't call myself a natural. It was a welcome distraction from the overwhelming pressures of school and adjusting to a new life.","I set a goal to finish my current writing assignment early and it was a struggle. I created a detailed schedule, breaking the project into smaller manageable chunks. I tried using a timer to stay focused, and celebrated small milestones to keep myself motivated.  It was frustrating juggling classes and social demands, and I often felt overwhelmed, but ultimately finishing early felt amazing.","A recent party left me utterly drained.  It was filled with shallow conversations and forced smiles.  I realized I prefer smaller gatherings with deeper connections; large, loud events feel superficial and overwhelming to me. I value quality time with a few close friends much more than large social events.","I recently had a major disagreement with a classmate over a group project. Instead of confronting them directly, I tried to understand their perspective, which was challenging.  My priority was completing the project efficiently, not necessarily resolving the conflict perfectly, as direct confrontation is not my style. Ultimately, I prioritized the task over mending our relationship.","During midterms, I felt crippling anxiety.  My initial response was to avoid everything, which I know isn't helpful.  To cope, I talked to a friend, exercised to burn off excess energy, and spent time journaling. These strategies helped somewhat, although the anxiety persisted – it's a constant battle, and I often find it a struggle to focus and find motivation.",y,y,y,n,y
634,"I’m always up for trying new things, even if it’s just a new way of thinking about a situation.  For example, I recently started analyzing my own feelings and reactions to my new college environment, which is something I hadn't done before. It helped me understand why I was feeling distant from home and even somewhat disgusted by my hometown; it was a coping mechanism during a major life transition.  I found the experience surprisingly rewarding, offering a sense of clarity and self-understanding.","I tend to be pretty organized and focused on my goals. My anniversary with Adam is tomorrow, so I've already planned to do something with him and attend the football game tonight.  I'm not always perfect at sticking to a schedule, and sometimes my priorities shift—like when I got distracted by my thoughts about my puppy.  Still, I manage to keep things reasonably on track, mostly through careful planning and prioritization, even if I sometimes get sidetracked by other thoughts.","I’m more of an introvert, and large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. For example,  Lori's very loud and attention-seeking behavior makes me uncomfortable and is frankly exhausting to listen to.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions. The constant stream of information and the noise levels tend to overwhelm me. This reinforces my preference for quieter, more introspective activities and smaller groups of close friends.","I generally try to be understanding, but I also have my limits. I'm concerned about Alyson's behavior and how inconsiderate it is. While I believe in resolving conflicts peacefully, I’m not afraid to express my disapproval if necessary.  Maintaining healthy boundaries is also important to me, and sometimes that means not engaging with people who are being disrespectful, like Alyson.  I am more likely to internally analyze a conflict rather than engage in a direct confrontation.","I can experience stress and anxiety, particularly during significant life changes like starting college. My initial reaction to stress is often introspection, spending time analyzing my emotions and trying to pinpoint their causes. This helps me rationalize the feelings and deal with them in a constructive way.  It's something of a self-soothing mechanism which helps me handle anxiety during these transitions.",y,y,n,y,n

Everything feels overwhelming and unfamiliar, so sticking to what’s comfortable, even if it’s just rereading the same few pages, feels safer than venturing into anything new.  The thought of trying something different just makes me anxious.","I've been trying to stay on top of my reading, but it’s been a struggle.  I set a goal to finish everything before class, but my motivation is low, and I keep getting distracted.  I haven't found any strategies that really work; procrastination is my default setting at the moment.   The pressure of keeping up with everything feels crushing.","Being surrounded by so many new people during Rush was draining. I crave the familiar comfort of my close friends from home.  Large groups of people and small talk are exhausting.  I really need my alone time to recharge.  I think I'm more introverted than I realized, or at least I definitely need more time alone than I thought.","The situation with my ex-best friend, discovering his lies, caused conflict.  I wasn’t confrontational, preferring to silently process my feelings rather than directly address the situation.  My priority is protecting myself emotionally right now, so avoiding further interaction is what's important to me.","Moving to college, dealing with the stress of Rush, and discovering my ex-best friend’s lies have been incredibly overwhelming. My initial response is to withdraw and isolate myself.  To cope, I mostly just count down the days until I can go back home, hoping everything will somehow magically return to ""normal"".",n,n,n,n,n
636,"I've always been drawn to the fantastical.  As a child, the wallpaper in my old house, featuring a blonde woman on an elephant, captivated me; I longed to be her. That desire fueled my imagination, and even now, I find myself drawn to creative writing and exploring different ways of thinking, even if it means struggling with new technologies like computers.","Juggling school, sorority commitments (10 hours a week!), and social life feels overwhelming.  I try to stay organized by making lists, but sometimes I get distracted. I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, but I can be quite determined when it comes to achieving something that strongly motivates me – I'm focused on getting into the school of communications.","I get energized by being around people, but large, unfamiliar groups can be draining. Sorority life is exciting and fun, yet the energy also consumes me.  I crave those social connections but also value my alone time to recharge. Balancing these two sides is a constant learning process.","I tend to avoid conflict.  Disagreements leave me feeling anxious, and I struggle to assert myself forcefully. I try to find common ground, but if a conflict feels too intense, I tend to withdraw. This may not always be the healthiest way to handle things, but I often value maintaining a peaceful surface above all else.","I'm easily overwhelmed and prone to anxiety. Starting college has amplified my fears: fears about academics, navigating a new environment, fitting in. The pressure leads to feelings of dread, often manifested through smoking cigarettes, which I know I should quit. I have to actively search for strategies to manage my stress—sometimes it helps to simply talk to my friends.",y,y,y,n,y

I’m fascinated by the underlying reasons for fears and behaviors. It felt satisfying to explore this, even if it's a small thing.","I prioritize planning and getting things done ahead of time.  The research experiment pretest, securing me that credit hour, is a perfect example. My time is tightly budgeted to manage my schedule and my worry about keeping up with the demands of college requires significant planning. I find this proactive approach rewarding, although sometimes stressful.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained. I find myself comparing my own struggles to keep up with college to others who seem effortlessly successful.  This generates stress, not energy.  I’m more comfortable with independent study or quieter pursuits.  The feeling of being overwhelmed by others' apparent ease emphasizes my introverted nature.","I haven't really described any direct conflicts in my essay, but I can say that I seem to implicitly accept the differences between people.  While I feel the pressure of comparison, I also state a belief that everyone is unique.  This underlying acceptance suggests a willingness to understand differing approaches to college life rather than overtly confronting those differences.","Starting college has been overwhelmingly stressful. The transition is more difficult than I anticipated; I worry about grades and keeping up. My immediate reaction is anxiety, which is why I mentioned my stress multiple times.  To manage this, I focus on careful planning and completing tasks ahead of schedule, which allows for a small sense of control.",y,y,n,n,y

My motivation was my cousin's recommendation, but I realized it wasn't a good fit for my academic goals. Afterward, I felt relieved to have more time for classes I actually cared about, though a little disappointed in myself for not recognizing that sooner.","I initially signed up for 15 credit hours, a goal that required careful time management. Dropping a class to reduce my load to 12 hours demonstrates my ability to adjust my goals to maintain balance. This decision prioritized my well-being and ability to succeed in the classes I remained enrolled in, something I value greatly.  I'm committed to making the most of my chosen coursework.","Attending R.U.F., the bible study, is an experience I anticipate will be energizing. I'm excited to meet new people and connect with others who share my faith.  The anticipation of this social interaction, along with the positive experiences I had with similar groups in high school, fuel my enthusiasm.  My desire to belong to a community is a strong motivator for my social engagement.","My roommate prefers that I don't use her computer, so I respect her wishes and utilize the dorm computers instead. Although it's slightly inconvenient, prioritizing her comfort demonstrates my agreeable nature. Maintaining positive relationships, especially with my roommate, is more important than my personal convenience.  It's important to me to keep the peace in my living situation.","I experienced homesickness and illness, which initially led to anxiety and a desire for my mother's care. However, I managed these feelings constructively by seeking medical attention at the health center. Taking this self-reliant approach is key for me to cope with distress. The subsequent relief of feeling better strengthened my ability to tackle future challenges with confidence and self-sufficiency.",n,y,y,y,y
639,"I don't typically seek out radically new experiences; I prefer familiarity and routine.  The essay doesn't detail any specific instances of trying something entirely new, so I can't speak to that directly. I'm more comfortable with things I already understand.","I value structure and organization.  When faced with a significant challenge like processing the death of a friend, I focused on managing my immediate emotional needs and supporting others, though the essay demonstrates a clear prioritization of supporting myself and processing grief. While I might not have formal plans for everything, I found solace in routines and predictable activities following the trauma.","The experience described in the essay was intensely draining, even though I was surrounded by others sharing the grief. I crave social connection but intense emotional situations, particularly involving loss, deplete my energy reserves.  I prefer quieter, more intimate interactions over large, boisterous gatherings.","The essay doesn't depict a direct conflict needing resolution, but it shows my empathetic nature. The focus was on supporting my friend's family and grieving alongside others. My priority was to offer comfort and acknowledge the shared sadness.  I value harmonious relationships but the intensity of shared grief wasn't something easily resolved.","The death of my friend was incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking. My initial reaction was shock and numbness. Later, I experienced overwhelming sadness and needed support.  I found comfort in familiar routines and the support of my family.  The essay indicates that intense emotions are difficult for me to process in isolation, making social support crucial for managing my emotional response.",n,y,y,y,n
640,"I wouldn't say I'm one for radically new experiences.  My essay shows I'm more focused on adapting to a new environment like college, rather than seeking out entirely novel activities. While I'm enjoying the transition, it's the familiar aspects of making friends and navigating academics that excite me, not something wildly outside my comfort zone.","The upcoming tests definitely spurred me into action. I've meticulously planned my study schedule, allocating specific times for each subject.  Staying on track is a priority; I'm quite focused on maximizing my study time. The challenge is managing my anxiety about the tests themselves, which sometimes distracts me from my well-laid plans.  The reward will be the sense of accomplishment from having organized myself and done my best.","The social aspect of college is both exciting and sometimes overwhelming.  Making new friends energizes me; I enjoy the process of getting to know people and building connections, as my essay clearly states. However, there's a certain level of social pressure (like the assumptions about relationships) that can be draining and makes me prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","I try to approach disagreements calmly.  While my essay doesn't mention a direct conflict, I'm generally inclined towards understanding others' perspectives.

Novel experiences tend to make me anxious, focusing on the potential for failure is more appealing than the uncertain outcome of something new. I'd rather stick to what I know works.","My main goal right now is to succeed in my studies.  I plan meticulously, making detailed schedules and prioritizing tasks.  To stay on track I use to-do lists, breaking down big assignments into smaller, manageable steps, and setting realistic deadlines. The fear of failure is my main motivator; staying committed despite setbacks is a must for me. Even small setbacks make me anxious, but the pressure keeps me focused.","Large social gatherings drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well. Spending time with close friends or family is energizing; the familiar comfort helps me relax and feel supported.

I was motivated by a desire to explore a different side of myself and to see if I could do something outside of what I considered to be my strengths.  The experience was…surprising.  I found some enjoyment in the process despite the overall feeling of not really understanding what I was doing.","I definitely struggle with procrastination.  Getting my schoolwork done on time is an ongoing goal. I usually end up cramming everything at the last minute, even if I know it's not ideal. While I wish I were more organized and better at planning, I'm trying to improve; I've noticed that breaking tasks down into smaller parts helps, although I still often wait till the very last moment to complete them.","Large, loud social gatherings generally leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. A recent gathering with close friends in my apartment was energizing; we just relaxed and talked; there was no pressure to be someone I'm not.

Recently, I had a disagreement with a friend about something important, and I handled it poorly. The situation was stressful and I tried to avoid confrontation. My priority was to maintain the friendship rather than addressing the disagreement completely and openly.  I realize now I should have been more assertive in sharing my perspective and find better ways to work through conflicts.","I'm generally pretty relaxed, but deadlines and unexpected events can get to me. The pressure of upcoming exams made me anxious and caused some procrastination, until I realized that being overwhelmed was leading me to be even less productive. I dealt with it by focusing on smaller tasks to create momentum, and found that talking to friends helped me reduce my anxiety levels significantly.",y,n,n,n,n

Despite the pressures of a new schedule and the anxieties I describe, I prioritize commitments like attending pledge line (a goal requiring sustained effort).  I show concern about managing my time effectively to avoid neglecting important responsibilities. My internal conflict about my weight and fitness routine also indicates a desire for self-improvement and control.","While I enjoy social situations where I feel included and accepted, such as being asked to participate in the pledge line, I'm not naturally drawn to the kind of boisterous social activity that leaves some people energized.  The essay shows my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions and how quickly the prospect of a blind date fills me with anxiety. This reveals a need for familiar social support and a preference for low-key social settings.","I value maintaining harmony in relationships, as seen in my determination to ""forgive and forget"" past hurts despite the difficulties described in the essay. While I internally grapple with conflict (like the date and feelings about weight) I would approach any interpersonal disagreement with an attempt to find resolution and understanding, prioritizing the emotional well-being of others. I'm focused on making people happy and am sensitive to their feelings.","The essay clearly reveals a high level of neuroticism.  Anxiety and stress are recurring themes, exemplified by my overthinking the blind date and worrying about my weight.

It was a welcome departure from my usual routine and sparked a new appreciation for hands-on activities.","Setting and achieving long-term goals has never been my strong suit.  I often find myself overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tasks involved and prone to procrastination.

When feeling stressed, my immediate reaction is to retreat and overthink. Then, to manage my emotions, I usually try to address the source of the stress in small, manageable steps.

My family reunion was fun, but mostly because it involved people I already know and love.","I struggle with maintaining long-term goals.  Keeping my house clean is a constant battle, and I often find myself procrastinating on tasks. While I *want* to be organized, I lack the discipline to consistently follow through.  I get overwhelmed easily, and sometimes I just give up.","Spending time with my family at the reunion energized me.  Being around loved ones who share similar values makes me feel supported and understood. Conversely, situations where I'm forced to interact with strangers or participate in large social gatherings can be draining. I recharge by spending time alone.","I can be quite opinionated, and disagreements can be difficult. Although I try to listen to others' points of view, I often find myself becoming defensive if I feel challenged. While I value harmony, my strong beliefs can overshadow that desire for compromise sometimes.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress.  My stomach problems are a symptom. I deal with stress by retreating, but I know I should do things like cleaning the house to alleviate stress and maintain my sense of control over life, but doing things like cleaning the house is still daunting.",n,n,y,y,n

I enjoyed the experience, though it made me realize how much I miss certain aspects of home.  The trip definitely broadened my horizons and offered a welcome escape.","My goal was to get a good job after graduation, so I spent most of my free time studying and networking. I used a planner and prioritized tasks to stay on track.  Staying committed was challenging at times, especially when faced with social pressures, but the thought of my mom's expectations kept me going. It was extremely rewarding to finally secure a position.","A memorable social experience was going out with friends. While I enjoyed the company, I also felt drained afterward. The interaction was fulfilling in terms of connection but exhausting because of the effort it took. This reinforced my need for alone time to recharge.","I've had disagreements with my sister Onni often. I tend to prioritize getting my point across while trying not to hurt her feelings. Resolving conflict with her is difficult because of our differing lifestyles, and I don't always manage the situation ideally.","When I feel stressed or anxious, I tend to retreat and overthink.  I initially feel overwhelmed and irritable. To manage it, I distract myself with hobbies or try to process my emotions. Sometimes, though, this process involves self-criticism and a cycle of negative thoughts.",y,y,y,n,y
650,"Last semester, I decided to join the debate team, something completely outside my comfort zone.  I was motivated by a desire to challenge myself and improve my public speaking skills. Although initially terrified, the experience proved incredibly rewarding, boosting my confidence and broadening my perspectives.","Balancing my sorority commitments, classes, and social life has been a significant challenge. I’ve tried using planners and setting daily goals to manage my time, but it's hard to stay on track.  While I enjoy social activities, prioritizing my academics has been rewarding—seeing progress in my studies gives me a sense of accomplishment, even if it's tough sometimes.","A recent sorority event was both energizing and draining. While socializing with my sisters was fun and invigorating, the constant noise and late nights afterward left me feeling depleted. It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings and quality time with close friends over large, boisterous social events.","There have been disagreements with my roommate regarding study habits.  We approached it by calmly communicating our needs and finding compromises, like designating certain study times and spaces. My priority was maintaining our friendship, as I value her company and appreciate our similar interests.","The pressure of college classes and maintaining friendships while meeting social obligations has been stressful.  Initially, I tried to avoid my worries; however, I eventually realized that talking to my roommate and friends really helped. Focusing on my studies and planning my day has proved more effective than avoidance.",y,y,y,y,n
651,"I’ve always been drawn to new experiences, and recently I went to the MTV music awards. While the beginning was great, with three bands playing at once, it quickly devolved into what I considered ""trendy mush.""  This experience confirmed my preference for genuine musical talent over fleeting trends. It also highlighted my openness to different kinds of music, although some of the ""bands"" I saw were hardly bands at all.","Balancing my social life with academics has been a continuous challenge. I missed a study session, and that made me feel bad, so I'm determined to do better. While I aim for consistency,  I struggle with time management sometimes. Laundry is a perfect example. The long drying times here are really frustrating.  I don't plan very well, but I am very committed to the things I care about like attending my study sessions in the future.","Going home to see high school friends will be energizing; being around familiar people and catching up is something I look forward to.  My dorm life is also pretty good, it's a nice social place. Conversely, the MTV Awards ultimately left me feeling a bit drained by the lack of substance. This highlights my need for genuine connection and meaningful experiences rather than shallow social interactions.","I have many friends who went through breakups. Seeing them get hurt is tough.  I struggle to know what to say to them. It's hard to balance empathy with wanting to avoid adding to their pain or offering platitudes.  I try to be supportive and understanding in such situations, but it also makes me want to avoid conflict or being put into the middle of it.",Missing my study session left me feeling anxious.  I get stressed when I feel behind.  I've been trying to develop better organizational strategies. Ultimately I realize that I just need to be more conscientious about my time management.  The stress and anxiety from not attending this study session will help me be better in the future.,y,y,y,n,y
652,"I'm always looking for new experiences, even if it's just trying a new type of 80s movie with friends.  I enjoy tracking my thoughts, as evidenced by this writing, and I’m fascinated by exploring different ways of communicating, like using instant messaging instead of the phone. It allows me to review our conversations afterward and reflect on what we’ve said. This helps me understand my relationships and my feelings better.","I tend to be less organized and structured in my approach to goals. Although I want to improve my spreadsheet and webpage, the essay reflects a lack of specific planning regarding deadlines and tasks.  The mention of procrastination suggests a struggle with time management and prioritizing commitments. My focus is more on the emotional aspects of my relationships.","Spending time with Allison energizes me; the essay shows how much I enjoy our interactions and look forward to seeing her.  Conversely, the conflict with her, as depicted, shows my distress and uncertainty. I crave intimacy and connection, but I'm also sensitive to potential conflict and rejection, indicating that social interactions can be both invigorating and emotionally taxing.","My relationship with Allison is characterized by a lot of give and take, some conflict and misunderstanding and a great deal of love.  I strive to understand her perspective, even when we disagree, but also find it challenging to communicate my needs and frustrations clearly. My love for her seems to outweigh immediate concerns over potential hurt feelings, prioritizing maintaining the relationship overall.","My anxieties revolve around the relationship with Allison. The essay showcases my worries about the future of our relationship,  my fears about causing her pain, and my emotional responses to her actions.  My reactions to conflict with Allison range from hurt to worry to intense introspection, showing a high degree of emotional sensitivity and reactivity.",y,n,y,y,y
653,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  Going to a large state university was a pretty big change from my small private high school, but that wasn't a conscious choice driven by a desire for novelty. It was more of a pragmatic decision, and honestly, I'm still getting used to it. The Hula Hut dinner was a nice break from the routine, and I did enjoy that, but mostly because it felt like a much needed escape.","I'm pretty good at staying on top of things.  Even though college is different than high school, I'm managing my time effectively, making sure to complete my schoolwork and sorority commitments, which is honestly pretty time-consuming. I'm aware of the challenges involved, but I don't find them particularly daunting; I generally feel pretty in control of my workload. My organization skills have been really helpful, though I'm worried about my large class sizes and not getting as much individual attention.","Large social gatherings drain my energy.  I enjoyed dinner with Katie because it was a small, intimate setting with someone I already knew and felt comfortable with.  The thought of going out every night like Meryl sounds exhausting to me.  I value quality time with a few close friends more than being surrounded by lots of people, which has definitely informed my choice of friends and my social activities.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. My conversation with Lauren and my feelings about Meryl illustrate this: I found myself feeling frustrated and even resentful that Meryl seemed to be thriving so easily in a new environment. Instead of expressing this directly, I chose to somewhat limit contact and avoid a confrontation, even if it means keeping some of my feelings to myself, which is probably not the best approach.","The cricket in my dorm room was unexpectedly stressful!  My initial reaction was disgust and a bit of anxiety over the unsanitary conditions. I'm planning to report it and get it resolved.  It wasn't a huge crisis, but it highlights how even small, unexpected events can make me feel anxious, something I’m working on addressing, though not actively yet.",n,y,n,n,y

I was motivated by the challenge and the potential to learn something new, even if it turned out to be more challenging than I anticipated.  While it's been stressful, overall I feel it will be rewarding.","Balancing my demanding organic chemistry class with my other responsibilities has been a real challenge.  I've tried using planners and setting daily goals, but sometimes life gets in the way.  Financial worries, particularly, have been a major distraction.  I am trying to find effective strategies to stay on track and keep my eye on the prize of graduation, but it's a constant work in progress.  It's rewarding to see progress, but definitely a stressful process!","Social situations can be draining for me. While I enjoy being around people I'm close to, large groups or superficial interactions leave me feeling exhausted.  The pressure to be involved in ""beta"" activities, for example, is not something I'm comfortable with. I recognize I need to carefully choose my social engagements to maintain my energy levels and avoid feeling overwhelmed.","Disagreements are difficult, especially when they involve people I care about, like Dannee.  I prefer to avoid direct conflict.  However, I value honesty, so I try to voice my concerns in a calm way and prioritize maintaining the relationship.  Sometimes, like with Genevieve, I struggle to reconcile my desire to help with the feeling that my advice might be ineffective.","I tend to get stressed easily.  Financial worries, academic pressure, and relationship problems weigh heavily on me. I typically handle stress by trying to find coping mechanisms.  Sometimes it's writing, other times, I just want to go home and eat.  I'm working on developing more effective stress-management techniques, but it's a slow process.",y,y,y,y,n
655,"I’ve never really been one for planned activities or structured experiences.  The most “open” thing I’ve done recently was listening to an old Oasis CD that unexpectedly transported me back to high school.  It wasn't a conscious decision, but the music spurred a flood of unexpected memories and feelings, which was surprisingly enjoyable. The spontaneity of it made it more meaningful than something I'd planned.","I struggle with long-term goals and sustained effort. I tend to just start writing emails to many people and not even consider the grammar or the sentence structure. I tend to be more reactive, following whatever grabs my attention in the moment. My attempt to write this essay for 20 minutes without stopping showed me how difficult it is for me to concentrate and resist urges to fix typos and restructure my sentences.  I am not at all organized or detailed.","Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  The phone call with my girlfriend Liz was more of a disruption, interrupting my train of thought.  This shows my need for focused time and quiet contemplation—though working through problems with Liz is still important to me.  I feel that big social events are just way too stimulating.","I'm not known for being agreeable.  Disagreements are handled pragmatically; I'll simply state my side of things, usually only if it's important to me and then I move on and won't push my point of view too strongly. While I find conflict uncomfortable, it isn't something I avoid if needed.  For example, my complaints about my roommate's music are implicit rather than direct.",Stress manifests as mental diversions and procrastination.  The thought of my professor reading my essay produces anxiety that I handle by focusing on tangents.  The distractions and silly thoughts and my phone call with Liz are ways to avoid the feelings of stress.  I don't have panic attacks; I just get distracted and take my mind elsewhere.,y,n,y,n,n

I found it surprisingly enjoyable, and while I'm not an expert, I'm already better than most in my class, which is rewarding.  It's opened my eyes to a new activity I might pursue further.","I haven't had a project requiring sustained effort lately. My thoughts often jump from one thing to another; my focus shifts quickly, as seen in my writing style.  I lack the consistent, meticulous planning that leads to long-term goal achievement.  Procrastination and distractions easily derail me.","Social interactions are often draining, as my essay shows.  I spend a good deal of time focused inward, on my thoughts and ideas, which makes external stimulation overwhelming. This essay itself proves that, jumping from thought to thought without much connection.  I prefer solitary activities and quiet time to recharge.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out.  My approach would probably involve avoiding direct conflict, perhaps subtly steering the conversation in a different direction or letting the other person have their way.  Maintaining a comfortable, conflict-free environment is usually a higher priority than asserting my own opinion forcefully.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a racing mind and an overwhelming amount of random thoughts, as this stream-of-consciousness writing demonstrates. My response is often internal—a flood of thoughts and ideas that shift rapidly.  I don't have specific strategies for managing these emotions; they tend to dissipate eventually.",y,n,n,y,n

My current priority is coping with my sadness and loneliness, which makes focusing on anything beyond immediate needs very difficult. The challenge is overwhelming, and I haven't found any effective strategies yet.",Social interactions are draining for me.

The lack of close social connections significantly increases my feelings of sadness and loneliness.,"I haven't had significant disagreements with anyone recently. My priority, as I mentioned, is my emotional well-being and adjusting to a new city and a long-distance relationship. I am mostly focused inward, dealing with my own feelings of sadness and loneliness, and not really engaged in many conflict-inducing situations.","I'm incredibly stressed and anxious about being away from my boyfriend and my support system.  My initial response is sadness, loneliness and crying. I try to distract myself by focusing on happy memories, but it’s a temporary fix that doesn't address the underlying issues causing me distress.

School and my long-distance relationship are stressing me out and I'm struggling to balance everything.  I haven't developed any effective strategies for staying on track, and I’m constantly worried about whether I’m making the right choices regarding my classes and my relationship.","Social interactions here are draining. The university is huge, and I haven’t met anyone I connect with. My roommate isn't great either, so I have no one to talk to.  I crave the comfort of my girlfriend and my old friends, and this new social environment feels overwhelmingly negative and isolating.","I haven't had any major disagreements here yet.  My main conflict is internal; I'm struggling to cope with anxiety and uncertainty about the future.  Even small issues, like my roommate, feel impossible to address because I lack the confidence and social skills to confront my problems head-on.","I’m constantly stressed and anxious. The uncertainty of college life, my long-distance relationship, and financial worries are consuming me.  I respond by overthinking everything, which only makes my anxiety worse.

The wedding preparations and upcoming birthday feel overwhelming, highlighting my preference for routine and familiarity.","I struggle with sustained effort and organization.  My essay shows the struggle to meet deadlines, the overwhelming number of tasks (wedding, studies, feeding my fish), and my tendency to get bogged down. Time management is not my strong suit, and I often get distracted. While I recognize the need for diligence, I often find myself falling short.","Social interaction is draining, especially in new settings. The university environment, while offering a ""comfort zone,"" is a struggle, as I find it difficult to connect with people. It's less about introversion/extroversion than about anxiety around social encounters. I crave the comfort of familiar faces and avoid anything too overwhelming.","Disagreements are stressful. I avoid conflict and tend to internalize my feelings rather than directly addressing them.  My roommate's departure is a difficult situation that I'm processing internally, rather than directly discussing concerns or feelings with her. My priority is maintaining a peaceful, low-conflict environment, even if it means suppressing my own needs.","I'm highly susceptible to stress and anxiety.  My essay reflects this well; the wedding, studies, and my roommate leaving are all significant stressors that trigger emotional responses such as anxiety.

My essay shows my focus is more on my established interests like interior design and spending time in familiar places like Austin. While I am excited about my trip to Ecuador with my sister, that's more of an extension of my love for travel and seeing new places that aligns with what I already know.","I'm pretty spontaneous, as you can probably tell.  The essay shows that my schoolwork feels overwhelming at times which implies I don't have a robust system for managing my time and resources. Procrastination might be something I struggle with, and while I enjoy school, I haven't developed effective strategies to consistently meet my academic goals.","The large architecture classes don't bother me; in fact, I mention looking forward to meeting more people.  I enjoy being around others, and the energy of a big class is something that energizes me rather than drains me.  My preference for larger social settings might indicate I am a somewhat extraverted person.","I haven't really mentioned any conflicts in my essay, and that doesn't mean I don't have disagreements. But,  I tend to avoid confrontation. My priority would be to maintain harmony and avoid any unpleasantness, maybe even to the detriment of expressing my own opinion fully.","I don't express any significant stress or anxiety in my essay.

To achieve this, I'm creating a detailed plan that balances studying and actively pursuing her. It's challenging to juggle these priorities, requiring significant discipline and time management.  The reward, however, is the potential to achieve academic success and find a fulfilling relationship.","Most social experiences drain me, especially the constant questioning about my move from Hawaii.  The pressure to explain myself and the lack of anonymity are exhausting. I crave fulfilling connections, but I’m often left feeling overwhelmed and introspective afterward.  My preference is for smaller, more intimate interactions with people I feel comfortable with.","I haven't encountered any significant disagreements recently, though the implicit pressure from others questioning my life choices could be viewed as a conflict. I tend to avoid confrontation; I don't actively express my feelings, choosing to internalize them and hope for understanding without overt disagreement. My priority is to maintain superficial harmony; it's more comfortable than resolving conflict directly.","The constant pressure of pursuing Nicole, the worries about academic success, and the self-doubt about my appearance all contribute to my anxiety.

I struggle with procrastination, often pushing tasks to the last minute.  While I make plans to manage my time better (""I'll have the weekend""), I frequently fall short.   Despite this, I'm committed to improving my time management. The reward is the joy of tennis, and the challenge is overcoming my procrastination.","The tennis club meeting was energizing.

Setting goals feels overwhelming, and I often jump between tasks (psychology before electrical engineering, for instance) rather than sticking to a plan.  The sheer amount of work often feels paralyzing, making it hard to stay focused.","Going to a concert was a high-energy social experience. Surrounding myself with like-minded people energized me. I crave social interaction with my friends and even old acquaintances, but sometimes it feels draining to navigate social expectations or the artificiality of some relationships.","I’m quite cynical and struggle to trust others completely, leading to conflict in how I handle disagreements. It's less about confrontation and more about a passive observation, noting inconsistencies and questionable actions in others.

Getting my books for class is a goal, but I haven't really planned it out meticulously. I’m worried about my financial aid coming through in time and I'm feeling the pressure of getting it done. However, I’m somehow able to focus on the urgent tasks and pull through.  The urgency of needing my books has served as my motivation, although I'm certainly not employing any sophisticated time-management strategies.","I definitely recharge better alone. That social aspect of things in college has been tough.  Large social gatherings can feel draining to me. I miss my friends back home, and that is something I am still working on. I find that the energy that goes into maintaining social connections is somewhat exhausting, hence, why I prefer more alone time.","I'm generally agreeable, but I can get frustrated when things aren't going my way. I'm working on my patience. As for resolving conflict, I tend to try and find a compromise or at least understand the other person's perspective.

Staying on track is difficult because my thoughts wander easily. I often lose focus or find myself procrastinating, and even when I attempt time management techniques they don’t work, it's always a struggle to maintain momentum.

The challenge lies in resisting the allure of social events that distract from my academic goals.","The rush event was exhausting.  While people seemed friendly, the constant socializing and forced interactions left me drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings.

My approach usually involves avoiding conflict and letting things slide, rather than actively confronting the other person. My priorities lie in maintaining a somewhat peaceful environment rather than addressing the disagreement head-on.","The stress of this assignment, coupled with the noise of the vacuum cleaners and the pressure to appear “cool,” made me anxious.  My initial response was procrastination and self-criticism. I tried to manage my emotions by focusing on the small positive aspects of the assignment and finding momentary escapes in letting my thoughts wander aimlessly.",n,n,n,n,y
669,"I’ve always been fairly open to new experiences, though I don't actively seek them out.  Learning to dance as a child was probably the biggest example, it stretched me in a way I didn't expect and I enjoyed the challenge and creativity it offered, even though I've since stopped.  I think it helped shape my willingness to try new things, even if it's just stepping outside my comfort zone a bit.","I'm pretty goal-oriented, but my approach is more about bursts of intense effort followed by periods of less focus.  Getting my degree required sustained effort but it wasn't always consistent. I tend to prioritize what's immediately pressing and work hard on that.  I procrastinate, but when deadlines loom, I get things done effectively, usually. The challenging part is balancing intense work with downtime.","Social situations can be draining, especially large gatherings. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to. A fulfilling experience is usually catching up with my sister. My family doesn’t always understand my need for space, as the whole focus of my grandfather's death seemed to be on my mother's emotional needs. This experience highlights my introverted nature and the importance of prioritizing time alone to recharge.","Disagreements are tough. I’m generally agreeable but sometimes my frustration can boil over if I feel someone is being unreasonable or self-centered, especially if they fail to acknowledge my feelings in times of family crisis.  I try to communicate my feelings directly and calmly, but if that fails, I tend to withdraw rather than engage in extended conflict.  My priority is honesty and being understood.","My initial reaction to stress is often anger or avoidance. With my grandfather's death, I’m grappling with unexpected feelings or lack thereof. I’m usually quite calm and measured and my feelings take time to process. In the past, I’ve found that allowing myself to feel the emotion, rather than suppressing it, eventually works, even if it's difficult and takes time.",y,y,y,y,n

It wasn't bad, but I'd rather watch TV.","I don't really set goals.  Things just happen.  If I have to do something, like this essay, I'll do it, but I'll distract myself with TV. I don't really have any strategies for staying on track.  I’m definitely more focused on the party this weekend.","Going to parties is energizing.  Being around people who are also drinking and partying is fun. Hanging out with Will and Melissa will be great.  Being around people like JJ, my mom, and those weird frat guys is totally draining.","I don't really like my mom. She's stubborn, and we disagree about a lot of things. I avoid her as much as possible.  If we have to interact, I just shut down.  It's easier than arguing.","I get stressed easily, especially when Mom calls.  When I’m stressed, I try to distract myself – by watching TV, listening to music, or hoping for a party invitation. Sometimes I get tired and just want to sleep.",y,n,y,n,y
671,"I've always been drawn to academic pursuits, excelling in them throughout my life.  Coming to this university felt like a leap into the unknown, a completely new environment and way of thinking. It was motivated by a desire for personal growth and to break free from the familiar. While the experience has been overwhelming at times, the challenge of adapting to a new system is ultimately a positive push outside my comfort zone.","I'm a highly driven individual, constantly setting goals for myself.  My goal of adjusting to university life has required immense time management, and I’ve prioritized organization to stay on track. I use to-do lists, calendars, and break down large tasks into smaller, manageable ones. While the social aspect has presented challenges, the academic side has kept me focused.  The rewarding part is seeing my progress, proving to myself that I can adapt and overcome obstacles.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed; I find them anxiety-inducing.  This stems from my inherent introversion and the feeling of being constantly judged. This is very different from smaller, more intimate social interactions where I can connect with individuals genuinely and on a deeper level. These observations have shaped my understanding of my need for solitude and careful selection of social situations.","Disagreements can be difficult for me.  My priorities are to understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it. I try to approach such conversations calmly, aiming for resolution through understanding and compromise rather than confrontation.  However, I often prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own views to some extent.","The feeling of being alone in a crowd is extremely stressful and anxiety-provoking for me. My initial response is to withdraw and overthink the situation, sometimes leading to self-doubt.  To manage this, I write down my feelings – it helps to process my emotions. Additionally, I focus on my academic goals to ground myself and regain a sense of control.",y,y,n,n,y

My thoughts are primarily focused on my current situation and how to navigate it, not on exploring new experiences.

I prefer the familiar.","I'm trying to be more conscientious about my schoolwork, given my current heavy workload. I am making a to-do list, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines, and trying to set aside specific times for studying. It's a struggle to stay on track, though;  I find it hard to concentrate at times and easily get distracted, especially when I think of other things like my family and friends. I wish I could be more focused.","Visiting my family is always energizing; being with them is so uplifting. But sometimes I feel a bit depleted when I'm alone, missing the support and interaction of my loved ones. I value my alone time to recharge but crave connection. Talking to my high school friends would be a great way to socialize and would likely be energizing.","I generally try to be agreeable, even if I disagree. I tend to avoid direct conflict, so I'll usually try to find common ground or just agree to disagree.  I prioritize maintaining relationships over pushing my own point of view.  I value harmony above all else.","The anxiety about my family's visit, and the initial disappointment when they couldn't make it, was pretty intense. I responded by letting my feelings wash over me.  Talking to friends and family helps regulate my emotions, but sometimes I need to be alone to process my feelings. I'm prone to worrying, but I'm learning to manage it.",n,y,y,y,n

I keep getting distracted. I should be doing my math homework or catching up on my biology reading but I’m procrastinating.  It’s challenging because I'm tired and frustrated, and the lack of motivation makes it even harder. The rewarding part will be having free time on the weekend.","Being here away from my friends is draining. I miss having people around who energize me. I need to be with my friends to feel happy.  I want to go home, spend time with them, and sleep in my own bed. This experience has reinforced how important my close relationships are to me.","My roommate and I have different standards of cleanliness.  I do most of the cleaning, which really bothers me.  I’ve tried talking to her, indirectly at least, but she doesn’t seem to change.  My priority is maintaining a clean and comfortable living space, and I don't know how to resolve this conflict.","Being away from home has made me feel stressed and anxious.

674,"Going to UT Austin was a completely new experience for me.  Leaving my small, familiar Catholic high school for such a huge university was terrifying, but the sheer volume of new people and experiences ultimately motivated me to embrace the change.  I’ve met so many interesting individuals from diverse backgrounds, and while some days have been overwhelming, I'm thrilled to be exploring a completely new environment and way of life.","While I haven't explicitly laid out a detailed plan,  adjusting to college life itself has required sustained effort.  Juggling meeting new people, attending classes, and figuring out my social life has been a constant balancing act.  The rewarding part has been the freedom and excitement of it all; the challenge has been managing my time effectively and avoiding procrastination.","Meeting new people and experiencing all that college life offers is incredibly energizing.  The sheer volume of social interactions, from casual conversations in the cafeteria to deeper connections with newfound friends, is a constant source of stimulation.  I crave this level of social engagement, and draining interactions are few and far between.","My boyfriend’s jealousy has been challenging.  While I value my relationships, my need for independence and exploration means there are bound to be disagreements.  I try to communicate openly and honestly, prioritizing mutual understanding but not compromising my personal freedom.",The sheer size of UT and the vast number of unknowns initially caused considerable anxiety.

While I found the actual process frustrating at times, the final product was surprisingly satisfying, and it sparked an interest in exploring other artistic avenues.","I consistently struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals. Procrastination and a lack of planning are my biggest hurdles;  I usually end up scrambling at the last minute.  The pressure of deadlines can be motivating, but I wish I could develop better time-management skills to avoid the stress.","Spending time with friends who are engaging and funny always energizes me.  However, large, noisy gatherings quickly become overwhelming and leave me feeling drained.  I crave genuine connection over large group dynamics and prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","I frequently find myself in disagreements where I prioritize expressing my own opinion, even if it leads to conflict. While I value honesty, I could improve on how I communicate my perspective without being abrasive or dismissive of others' feelings.","Feeling stressed or anxious often manifests as racing thoughts and irritability.

However, I did join several clubs and organizations, which was a little outside of my comfort zone, primarily to meet people and potentially network. It’s been overwhelming, to say the least.","I struggle with juggling multiple commitments.  My week is a whirlwind of work, school, volunteer activities, and club meetings. I rarely plan ahead; things just happen. I tend to react to deadlines rather than proactively manage my time.  The sheer volume is challenging, but I'm determined to see it through. Ultimately, the lack of planning is what makes everything stressful.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained.  Even ""fun"" events like shopping trips feel like obligations that take away from my already limited free time. I’m more comfortable working alone or with only a few close people, instead of larger groups.  I value my alone time.","I avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize it or find ways to avoid confronting the issue directly. It’s easier to go with the flow, even if it means sacrificing my own opinions. My priority is avoiding confrontation, even if it isn't the best solution in the long run.","I'm frequently stressed and anxious.

I manage my time by meticulously planning my schedule and dedicating specific blocks of time to each assignment. I stick to this routine, even when it's challenging, because academic success is a top priority for me.  The challenge is balancing my studies with everything else, but the reward is the feeling of accomplishment when I complete my work.","Large social gatherings, like parties, can be draining.  I enjoy interacting with people I know well, but the superficiality and sometimes aggressive behavior of some individuals, as seen at parties, leaves me feeling exhausted. These experiences reinforce my preference for smaller, more meaningful interactions with people who share my interests and values.","When I disagree with someone, I try to understand their perspective, even if I ultimately don't agree with them. I prioritize being respectful and calmly stating my viewpoint.  Sometimes, especially when confronted with blatant prejudice, I might be less agreeable, though I still try to communicate my disagreement assertively, rather than aggressively.","When I'm stressed, I tend to internalize my feelings initially.

While overwhelming at first, meeting new people in my sorority, AEPhi, has been surprisingly rewarding and has made the experience more positive than I anticipated.","Balancing schoolwork, a new social life, and a long-distance relationship has been a challenge.  I haven't developed strong time management skills, and often find myself overwhelmed and procrastinating.  My commitment to these things fluctuates greatly depending on how stressed I am. I find the whole experience challenging, but the potential rewards are huge.","The sorority rush week was incredibly draining.  The constant socializing and pressure to make connections left me exhausted and emotionally spent.  I've realized I need periods of solitude to recharge, and large social gatherings are not my ideal environment for sustained energy.","I haven't had any major conflicts yet, but the essay shows I'm currently dealing with the stress of a less-than-ideal romantic relationship.  My priority is managing my own emotional responses to that stress, and currently I am not sure how that will look.","Moving away from home and adjusting to a new lifestyle has been incredibly stressful.

Even trying out for the diving team felt like a relatively safe choice, a familiar activity from high school, rather than a complete leap into the unknown. I'm practical, and I need to see a clear benefit before I'll try something completely different.","Getting into business school is a huge goal.  I'm meticulously managing my time, balancing studying (especially for economics, which is really challenging!), with my extracurricular interests.  I use planners and to-do lists and try to stick to a schedule.  The challenge is finding enough time for everything, and the reward will be getting into the school I've worked so hard to enter.  Knowing this helps keep me motivated, especially when things feel overwhelming like they do with economics.","Trying out for the Texas cheer team was a highly social experience, and even though I didn't make it, the whole process was energizing.  The interactions with other girls, the shared goal, the feeling of teamwork, it was all incredibly positive.  It highlighted my need for that kind of social connection and collaborative environment.  I think social experiences where I feel a sense of belonging are really fulfilling for me.","I haven't had many major disagreements yet, but if I'm struggling in economics and feel like I can't ask for help from classmates, that shows I'd rather keep the peace then rock the boat, perhaps at the cost of my own success. I’m generally agreeable and prioritize maintaining positive relationships.  However, the economics situation highlights how sometimes the desire to avoid conflict might negatively impact my own academic success.","The uncertainty about my economics class, the upcoming tests, and the diving team decision have made me pretty anxious. Initially, I get stressed, and I spend a lot of time worrying and overthinking things. I manage my anxiety by trying to stay organized and on top of my schoolwork, which is my typical coping mechanism.

My biggest challenge is managing my time effectively, especially with the overwhelming amount of reading.  I’m definitely not as organized or disciplined as I’d like to be.  The reward would be graduating and having that stress lifted.","Being surrounded by so many unfamiliar faces in my classes is draining. I miss my close friends from home, and sometimes the large, impersonal environment of college makes me feel lonely.  I recharge by talking to Charley on the phone; spending time with familiar and close friends fills my social cup.  I need smaller, more intimate social interactions.","I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet or agree to disagree, unless it truly affects me. I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony over expressing dissenting opinions, as I am trying not to add more to my plate.","The stress of college has been intense; the workload is overwhelming, and I miss my old life.

Although adjusting has been challenging, I am excited about what the future holds.","Balancing schoolwork, making new friends, and maintaining connections with my family back home has been my biggest challenge. I’ve tried to create a schedule and prioritize my schoolwork, knowing that’s why I’m here.  It's been difficult to stay on top of everything but I'm learning to prioritize tasks and I'm trying to improve my time management skills.  I find it rewarding to see progress in my studies, but challenging to limit socializing.","My sorority has provided plenty of social opportunities.  I've had some great interactions that have left me feeling energized and connected. However, there are times that I just need some time to myself to recharge as well.

Initially, I felt homesick and anxious.

I had to find a salon with availability and manage my time around other commitments. Although finding an appointment proved challenging, the success in securing one prior to the event felt very rewarding and demonstrates my ability to prioritize tasks.","Meeting the guy I'm going with to the sorority game was a memorable social experience that energized me. While I've only known him for a short time, his easygoing nature made for comfortable conversation and enjoyable companionship.  This shaped my understanding that even quick connections can be fulfilling and highlights my capacity to quickly feel comfortable in social settings.","Living with a new roommate whose boyfriend stayed over for an entire weekend, very early into the school year, presented a challenge. While I understand and respect her need for freedom, I politely explained my discomfort, prioritizing clear communication to avoid future similar situations.  The situation reinforced the importance of expressing my boundaries and needs assertively but respectfully, and I have no regrets for having done so.","Homesickness hit me hard last week. I initially responded by reaching out to my best friend but since she was out, I turned to another friend to feel a little better, and then wrote a long email to my other best friend to pour out my heart.

My focus is entirely on Kim, and any attempts at self-improvement feel pointless without her. My time and energy are consumed by my thoughts about her, making it nearly impossible to concentrate on anything else.

While I try to be amicable, the hurtful rumors make it difficult to be entirely agreeable.

The essay reveals a preference for familiar experiences and routines, so exploring something totally different wouldn't fit my current priorities.","Getting into business school is a major goal for me, so I’m working hard to achieve a good GPA.  I have to manage my time carefully; I struggle to balance academics with other things, like basketball and social life. It’s a challenge but important because I want to leave my current major, and I know achieving a good GPA will enable me to make this transition.","I find social situations both energizing and draining. Hanging out with friends playing basketball, for example, really energizes me. But sometimes the constant socializing required of college life makes me want to retreat and recharge. I am extraverted, but not overly social.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. When disagreements arise, like with my calculus TA (who I think is awful), I usually keep my complaints to myself rather than directly confronting her.

This is a pattern revealed in the essay where I do not directly confront those who are bothering me.","I get stressed easily, especially when facing academic pressure. My initial response to stress is often frustration or anxiety, as shown by my complaints about difficult classes and professors.  I don’t have healthy coping mechanisms, and I tend to worry a lot.

Afterward, I was relieved it was finished, but not particularly excited about the process.","Meeting deadlines is incredibly important to me.  With the chemistry lab report, I prioritized getting it done, even if it meant asking neighbors for help late at night.  My strategy was to tackle each task one at a time—report, pre-lab, experiments—and I stayed focused until everything was completed. While I was stressed, the satisfaction of finishing on time was rewarding, although the rushed nature of it worries me a bit regarding the grade.","I find large social gatherings draining.  The math discussion class, while not strictly social, felt draining due to boredom and exhaustion.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions or even time alone.  This experience reinforces my preference for quiet time to recharge after busy periods.","I tend to avoid conflict, and I prioritize practical solutions.  While the essay doesn't directly mention a disagreement, my approach to asking neighbors for help suggests a focus on getting the task done efficiently rather than potential for conflict or debate. I was just very direct and focused on finding a printer and wasn't too concerned with niceties.","I get stressed when overwhelmed by tasks, such as when I had to complete my chemistry lab report and experiments.

I'd rather stick to routines and familiar things.","My essay reveals a struggle with organization. Finding the FAC building is a major goal for me, highlighting a lack of efficiency in my current schedule and planning. While I seem concerned about meeting deadlines (like Caitlin's birthday), my overall approach seems more reactive than proactive.  I’m focused on the present moment more than long-term planning.","The essay reveals a clear preference for solitude and a lack of confidence in social interactions.  My interactions with Jared are a focus, reflecting a desire for connection, but also anxiety around initiating or maintaining friendships.

The essay lacks any description of an overt disagreement; my worries are predominantly internal—concerns about others’ opinions of me, my academic performance, and my physical health.

I had a goal to finish my Calculus homework and reading, but I keep getting sidetracked.  I am bothered when things aren't completed in the order they should be, making it hard to stay organized. The unfinished problem bothers me, illustrating my lack of conscientiousness.","The essay reflects my discomfort with socializing at college.  I find the social interactions draining, likely due to a perceived difference in how people act compared to my high school experiences.  It reinforces my preference for solitude and makes the thought of meeting more people stressful and slightly unnerving.  I'm not sure I can do this college thing.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately that I can recall right now.

Honestly, I'm still adapting and getting used to things.","I don't really set goals. I mean, there's this writing assignment, but other than that, I don't put a lot of effort into any long-term goals. I guess stopping cursing was a goal, for a while, but I gave up on that.

If I disagree with someone, I usually just go along with it and don't really voice my own opinion. I try to keep things superficial. It’s easier that way.  I’m not someone who prioritizes having my own way or arguing a point, particularly if it involves confrontation.","I get stressed out easily.  The fire drill definitely got me all worked up. I responded by just wanting to sleep. Generally, I deal with stress by avoiding the situation if I can.

While I have aspirations and hopes (like finding a soulmate or succeeding in my studies), the essay reveals a lack of concrete planning or strategies to achieve them.  My focus is more on the emotional and relational aspects of my life than on detailed goal setting and execution.","I enjoy social events and connecting with people, but I also crave moments of peace and quiet, according to my essay. My extensive list of questions regarding my romantic and platonic relationships reveals a longing for connection. The large number of people mentioned indicates that I do enjoy social interaction, yet it seems that the essay is written from a more introspective perspective.","I generally try to get along with people. The essay shows I value my friendships (especially with Abby) and seem concerned about maintaining positive relationships, even expressing worry about potential conflicts (like with Brittany).  However, my romantic relationships are depicted as slightly less harmonious, with concerns about how certain relationships will develop.","I tend to worry a lot.  The essay overflows with questions about the future –  romantic relationships, friendships, academic success, etc. – indicating significant underlying anxiety and uncertainty about the future. My many questions show a need for reassurance and demonstrate how easily I get overwhelmed by what may happen.",y,n,n,y,n
690,"I'm not exactly someone who jumps into brand new experiences headfirst.  While I went to college, which was a big change, I mostly did it because it was the expected next step. My experience so far has been… underwhelming.  I haven't really sought out dramatically different activities or ways of thinking. I'm more comfortable with the familiar.","I'm pretty organized and get things done, especially when I’m motivated by avoiding negative outcomes.  Managing my time in college requires a good amount of discipline, and I find that making lists and setting small, achievable goals helps me to stay on track with assignments. The challenge? Keeping up with everything while also allowing myself to have fun. It’s a balancing act.","The frat parties are exhausting.  Being around so many people, even if they are superficially fun, ultimately leaves me drained. I much prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I truly connect with.  Large, noisy crowds are just not my thing, and this experience has solidified my introverted preferences.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with.  Disagreements are usually handled by me avoiding conflict, which is probably not the best approach. I tend to prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means not fully expressing my own opinion. Honestly, I don't enjoy confrontation.","I get stressed easily and tend to overthink. Feeling homesick and overwhelmed by my new surroundings brought on a wave of anxiety. To manage it, I mostly relied on distracting myself - like writing this assignment - and counting down the days till I go home. I am trying to think more positively about it all.",n,y,y,n,n
691,I'm not really one for trying new things.  I prefer sticking to what I know.  The thought of venturing outside my comfort zone is unsettling.  Even thinking about it makes me anxious.,"I'm quite focused and organized when I set my mind to something. I meticulously plan out how I'll accomplish my goals, breaking them down into manageable tasks. I use checklists and schedules to keep myself on track. While challenges can sometimes derail me, I usually manage to get back on course fairly quickly.  The sense of accomplishment when I achieve a goal is very rewarding.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained.  Large gatherings or extended periods of socializing are particularly taxing, and I find myself needing time alone afterward to recharge.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I know well, rather than big, boisterous events.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, often prioritizing harmony over expressing my own opinion strongly. If a disagreement does arise, I will try to find a compromise, often to the point of neglecting my own needs to maintain a peaceful relationship.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. My initial reaction is often to overthink and worry excessively. I tend to dwell on potential problems, creating scenarios in my head, and analyzing the situation until I find a solution.  To cope, I try to break down problems into smaller, more manageable pieces, and focus on solving them systematically.",n,y,n,n,y
692,"I’ve always been drawn to exploring new musical artists.  Recently, I delved into the discography of Crosby, Stills & Nash, and subsequently Buffalo Springfield.  Their sound and harmonies were captivating, a pleasant surprise that sparked a new appreciation for that era of folk-rock.  The experience was fulfilling and broadened my musical horizons.","I struggle with sustained effort towards goals, which is evident in my procrastination on this very assignment.  I haven’t developed effective time management strategies, so meeting deadlines is a consistent challenge.  I find the lack of structure frustrating, but the freedom to wander in my thoughts, however unproductive, can sometimes be strangely rewarding.",Social interaction generally drains me.  Even casual conversations can leave me feeling exhausted and needing time alone to recharge.  The essay reflects this; writing it feels less like a social interaction and more like an exploration of my own thoughts. The need to interact with others is a low priority for me.,Disagreements tend to be something I avoid.  I’m not one for confrontation and would prefer to sidestep conflict whenever possible. My priorities in these situations are to maintain peace and avoid upsetting anyone involved.,"Frustration and helplessness frequently overwhelm me.  My initial response to stress is often a retreat inward, accompanied by a sense of hopelessness.  I find solace in listening to music and letting my thoughts wander, but it is not a particularly healthy or effective coping strategy.",y,n,n,n,y
693,"I haven't really done anything drastically different lately, mostly sticking to familiar routines and activities.  However, starting college itself was a huge shift in environment and lifestyle, pushing me outside my comfort zone. While initially apprehensive, I ultimately felt a sense of accomplishment and excitement about this new chapter.","This semester, I've aimed to improve my academic performance, which requires a substantial time commitment and organized planning. I use a planner and to-do lists to manage my time effectively and ensure I'm on top of deadlines.  Although juggling my social life and studies has been challenging at times, the reward of academic success keeps me motivated, even when I'm tempted to procrastinate.","Going out with my friends is usually energizing, but the Sig Ep party wasn't appealing this time. I preferred to stay home, catch up on my work, and recharge my batteries. Being around others can be draining when I feel stressed. I’ve realized that having some alone time is crucial for maintaining a good balance and avoiding burnout.","When my friend was upset about a guy's comment, I tried to help her see the situation more rationally, and emphasized the possibility that her reaction was overly sensitive.  I prioritized understanding her feelings while also offering a balanced perspective.  Ultimately, I think I successfully helped her calm down and see the situation for what it really was—not a big deal.","Starting college has been a stressful experience, and the amount of work has been overwhelming at times.  My initial reaction is often anxiety, but I try to manage it by creating a detailed study schedule and prioritizing tasks.

694,"I've always been drawn to learning new things, whether it's a new skill or exploring a different culture. This summer, I decided to try out a new budgeting app to help me track my expenses and savings more effectively. While it involved changing my usual habits, it was a positive experience that gave me more control over my finances and alleviated some of the stress surrounding money matters. I felt empowered and more capable of achieving my financial goals as a result.","One goal I set for myself was saving a significant portion of my summer earnings for college. I created a detailed budget, tracking income and expenses diligently to ensure I saved consistently. Even with unexpected expenses, I remained committed by prioritizing my savings and making minor adjustments to my spending habits. I found the process challenging yet highly rewarding; the sense of accomplishment from achieving my savings goal reinforced my self-discipline and strengthened my resolve.","Social situations tend to drain my energy, requiring significant recovery time afterwards. A recent gathering with several friends where the conversation was dominated by one person left me feeling exhausted and frustrated. This experience underscored my need for quieter, more intimate social settings; large groups of people tend to be overwhelming.  I realized I need to be more assertive about setting boundaries in social situations to better manage my energy levels and avoid feeling depleted.","Disagreements arise occasionally, especially regarding financial matters within my family. When discussing the perceived unfairness of a sibling receiving a car, I prioritized expressing my feelings honestly while attempting to maintain respect. While direct confrontation wasn't avoided, I prioritized expressing my emotions and understanding their perspective, seeking resolution through thoughtful communication rather than conflict.","The car situation caused me significant stress and anxiety. My initial response was sadness and anger, but I recognized the need to process my feelings constructively. Talking with a close friend helped me reframe my thoughts and perspective, enabling me to see the bigger picture and gain emotional distance. While the initial emotional distress was intense, actively addressing it proved invaluable in mitigating the negative impact and promoting better mental well-being.",y,y,n,y,y
695,"I guess trying something new would be…this whole assignment.  It’s definitely weird, and unlike anything I’ve done before. I was motivated by the sheer bizarre nature of it; it's a welcome distraction from the stress of school.  Honestly, I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, but it’s certainly memorable.","I definitely haven’t been conscientious about my schoolwork lately.  I’m way behind in everything, and constantly putting things off until the last minute.  My time management is atrocious. I really haven't had any strategies,  just pure procrastination. It's definitely been more challenging than rewarding.","Going to The Olive Garden with my roommate was pretty energizing.  Talking to the waiter, even though he was a bit crude, was entertaining. I enjoy social interactions like that, as long as they're fairly casual and lighthearted.  It reinforces my preference for relaxed social settings with friends.","I didn't really have any major disagreements, but the waiter's comment about high school and smoking joints was a bit jarring.  I just kind of laughed it off. I didn't really care enough to make an issue out of it; it wasn't a huge deal. My priority is to have a good time and not create unnecessary conflict.","This whole assignment, combined with being behind in school and other things going on, has made me pretty stressed.  My initial reaction was to procrastinate, but I’m forcing myself to finish this.  I’m managing by writing it, getting it over with as quickly as possible.",y,n,y,y,n
696,"I wouldn't say I'm a huge risk-taker, but the other day I impulsively went to a party I wasn't even invited to. I was motivated by sheer boredom and the possibility of meeting someone new.  It was...okay.  I met Mary, and we’re going out tonight, so I guess that counts as something positive.","I'm not the most organized person.  Setting and maintaining goals isn't really my strong suit. I mean, I *wanted* to do better in my classes, but I've missed a bunch, and I haven’t really tried to do anything about it. I do sometimes feel guilty about it, though. I guess that's something.","I mostly avoid large social gatherings; they usually leave me feeling drained. This party was an exception, mostly because I was hoping to see Mary again. I think being around a lot of people is too much stimulation for me. I recharge best alone, or with a small group of close friends.","I tend to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just keep quiet. I’m not great at expressing my opinions directly, which can lead to unresolved issues. It's easier to just let things slide, even if that's not always the best approach.","I get stressed out easily.  The date with Mary tonight is making me incredibly anxious.  I’ve been lying a lot lately, and I feel really guilty about it. To cope, I usually just smoke and drink, which probably isn't the healthiest way to manage my stress.",y,n,n,n,y
697,Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer the familiar and comfortable.  I’d rather spend time with close friends than do something completely out of my comfort zone.  The thought of trying something radically new actually stresses me out a bit.,"I’m not really one for planning and scheduling, let alone sticking to them.  This assignment is the exception, and even then, it's only because I have to do it for a grade.  Generally, I tend to put things off until the last minute, which sometimes leads to stress but also somehow manages to work out. The freedom from constraints is more rewarding than meeting deadlines.","Large social gatherings drain me.  Being around lots of people for extended periods makes me anxious and irritable. I much prefer spending time with a select few close friends.  Smaller, more intimate settings are much more energizing and feel much more natural to me.","I can be pretty stubborn in disagreements.  My priorities are usually centered around expressing my own viewpoints, even if it means the conflict remains unresolved. I don't necessarily prioritize compromising or finding middle ground, even if it would cause less stress.","Being away from home for three days, even if it was fun, left me stressed and slightly anxious. I find comfort in routine, and being out of my normal environment felt chaotic and unsettling.  I compensated by focusing on enjoying myself and the social interactions, but I still felt a nagging undercurrent of anxiety.",n,n,n,n,n

I was motivated by my desire to socialize and have fun, and despite the chaos, I actually enjoyed the experience and it made me feel less stressed. I’m thinking about trying new things more often, even if they seem a little out there.","I've struggled to stay on track with my business classes. While I planned to attend every class, I frequently miss them, mainly because of my disinterest in the material and my tendency to prioritize other things. I haven't developed any strong time management strategies, and I tend to procrastinate heavily.  It's rewarding when I manage to make it through a class, but overall, it's been a challenging experience.","A recent memorable social experience was hanging out with my friends last night; it energized me. Their company distracts me from my worries and makes me feel less stressed. The fulfilling interaction reinforced my need for close friendships to counteract feelings of loneliness. I prefer intimate settings rather than large, overwhelming social gatherings.","I disagree with my choice of major. While my friends and family pressure me to stick with it for practicality, I don't see it as a long-term possibility. I don’t handle conflict directly. I avoid confrontation and often just let things be without asserting my opinion which leads to a lack of resolution.  My priority is avoiding arguments and maintaining superficial harmony, even if it means sacrificing my own happiness.","I often feel stressed and anxious, especially about school, relationships, and the future. My initial response is often to retreat into myself and overeat or oversleep. To manage my stress, I spend time with my friends and indulge in comfort activities, but  I also ruminate on negative thoughts which leads to increased anxiety and stress.  I need to find healthier coping mechanisms.",y,y,n,n,y

I usually stick to what I like, but I felt adventurous and decided to try something that was unfamiliar.  It was surprisingly enjoyable, and it encouraged me to be more open-minded about different culinary experiences.  I felt good about stepping outside my comfort zone.","Planning a big trip, like the one I'm taking this weekend to SeaWorld, requires a lot of planning and organization. I made a list of everything I needed to do, from booking tickets to packing my bags.  I also checked and double-checked to make sure everything was set. While sticking to the plan was challenging at times, the sense of accomplishment when everything went smoothly made it all worthwhile.","Spending time with my boyfriend always energizes me.  His company is incredibly comforting and makes me feel understood. We share a similar sense of humor, and we’re able to engage in easy, free-flowing conversations.  Being around him is always fun and relaxing, and it strengthens our bond. I feel more drained in large group settings though, and prefer more intimate settings.","There was a time my mom and I had conflicting ideas about the weekend plans. I prioritized my own happiness and didn't really consider her feelings as deeply as I should have. In the end, I made a decision that would make me happy even if it meant upsetting her.  I felt justified because of how excited Jeremy was about it, and felt a bit guilty afterwards.","The thought of not getting enough sleep before this trip has been stressing me out. My response was initially to worry, but I've taken steps to manage the anxiety, like organizing everything and getting good rest tonight. The stress is mainly about the trip going well and is not truly overwhelming.  It’s important for me to manage my concerns so I can enjoy myself on the trip.",y,y,y,y,n
700,"I haven't really tried anything *completely* new lately.  I mostly stick to what I know, which is mostly music. Although I dream of big things like figuring out the origins of humanity, that feels more like a fantasy than something I'd actively pursue.  My focus is more on mastering the guitar and expressing myself through music.","I struggle with setting and sticking to long-term goals.  School is a big example.  I have aspirations, like becoming a rockstar, but I haven't developed a concrete plan to achieve them. I'm more driven by feelings and inspiration than by strict schedules and organization.  The thought of structured planning is actually quite overwhelming.","I'm energized by performing music, or even just imagining huge crowds going wild for me. That's my dream.  Being around close friends and family is also good.  Large groups, or groups where I don't know anyone well, are draining.  I need a balance between performing and having moments of quiet reflection.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to just quietly go along with it to avoid any confrontation.  I value my friendships and relationships and want to avoid ruining them with arguments, even if I disagree with someone's viewpoint.","I get stressed easily.  Doubt and uncertainty about my future weigh heavily on me.  When I'm stressed, I tend to retreat into myself and my music. It's my main escape.

While the initial experience was terrifying, the sense of accomplishment afterward was incredible; I felt a profound sense of self-efficacy.","My goal was to graduate college with honors. To stay on track, I created a detailed study schedule, prioritizing tasks, and consistently reviewing my progress. When challenges arose (like unexpected illness), I adjusted my plan and sought help when needed.  The rewarding aspect was achieving my goal, but the consistent effort required was also deeply satisfying.","A memorable social experience that left me feeling drained was attending a large party.  The constant noise and overwhelming number of people were exhausting, and I found it difficult to engage in meaningful conversations. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends.","In a disagreement with a roommate over household chores, I prioritized open communication and compromise.  Rather than focusing on being ""right,"" I tried to understand their perspective and find a solution that worked for both of us.  Maintaining a positive relationship was my top priority.","When facing a major deadline for a project, I experienced intense anxiety.

I set a goal to be more organized, but it's proving incredibly difficult.  I try to manage my time by making lists, but I often ignore them until the last minute. I feel guilty when I fail, but finding the willpower to change is my biggest challenge.","Going out to eat with my friends was a good time.  Being around people I enjoy is energizing for me, although the guilt from missing church afterward weighed me down a bit.  I like social interaction, but I can overdo it.","I didn't handle the situation with my mom very well; I lied to her about going to church.  My priority at the time was to avoid confrontation and guilt, even if it meant being dishonest. I value my relationship with her, but honesty isn't always my strong suit.","Feeling tired and guilty about missing church definitely made me anxious.

I make lists, but even then, things often fall through the cracks. I tend to prioritize what's immediately pressing, which sometimes means neglecting longer-term goals.  Time management isn't really my strong suit. Getting my studies done is a constant battle.","Most social interactions leave me feeling drained rather than energized. I can handle small groups of people I already know, but large gatherings or meeting strangers is exhausting.

I create detailed timelines, breaking them down into manageable tasks.  I use organizational tools to track progress and prioritize deadlines, even though it’s difficult sometimes. While it's challenging to balance everything, the satisfaction of completing a complex project makes the struggle worthwhile.","A recent band practice was incredibly energizing. The collaborative creative process, combined with the camaraderie and shared passion for music, created a highly positive and fulfilling experience.

I feel a strong need to complete my assignments, and this motivates me despite my fatigue and distractions.","I'm happier alone; social situations can be draining.  My roommate’s constant noise clearly bothers me, reflecting a preference for solitude and quiet.  The positive anticipation of the weekend, free from classes and social obligations, further indicates a preference for independent time.","I tend to avoid confrontation. While I dislike my roommate, the essay shows I tolerate him because I don't have to interact with him extensively. This suggests a prioritization of avoiding conflict over expressing my negative feelings directly, even in a private setting.","I get stressed easily.

I'd probably attempt to find a compromise or at least agree to disagree, prioritizing maintaining a peaceful relationship over being ""right."" I’m generally an easygoing person, so direct confrontation is something I try to sidestep.","Stress and anxiety make me feel restless and easily distracted.

The essay reflects my preference for familiar routines and a slight apprehension towards the unknown, like when I mentioned my dislike of science classes and worry about the difficulty of geology.  Trying new things isn't something I naturally gravitate towards; I'd rather stick to what I know and feel comfortable with.","I'm pretty organized and focused on my goals, as evidenced by my planning for the gym and concern about managing my time effectively for classes and assignments. I prioritize sticking to schedules and routines to ensure I complete tasks and meet deadlines.  While I might worry about workload (as I mentioned my concern about having too much work), I generally try to stay on top of things, using planning and prioritizing to keep myself on track.","I get energy from social interaction, but I also need my alone time to recharge. I mentioned looking forward to meeting the girls in my dorm and making friends,  and expressed a bit of sadness over missing my friends from home. This suggests I value social connection,  but I also acknowledge the importance of having some personal space and time to myself to avoid feeling drained.","I generally aim to be cooperative and friendly. The essay demonstrates my friendly attitude to my dorm-mates by hoping to become friends with them.  While I don't explicitly describe a conflict, my general approach to people appears positive and accommodating, prioritizing maintaining harmonious relationships.","I tend to worry, as seen in my anxieties about class difficulty, workload, and technology.  My concerns about my assignment getting lost online and my negative reactions to past experiences with science classes also highlight a tendency towards nervousness and apprehension.  Although I may be prone to some worry, I seem to cope by planning and organizing, which provides a sense of control over my anxieties.",n,y,y,y,n

My approach is straightforward; I focus on completing tasks within the given timeframe.  I manage my time by regularly checking the clock. While I might have some distractions, my main strategy is to simply get it done, as efficiently as possible.","Social interactions are generally draining for me.  My essay reveals my discomfort around my roommate's friend, highlighting my preference for solitude and avoidance of potentially intense social situations. Energetic social experiences are not something I seek out; they tend to leave me feeling depleted.","Disagreements make me uneasy.  I would probably try to avoid direct confrontation. In a disagreement, my priority would be maintaining peace and avoiding conflict, even if that means suppressing my own feelings or opinions. Direct and open conflict is not something I prefer.","Stress and anxiety manifest as avoidance and worry, as seen in my essay.

I prefer familiar things.","I haven't exactly been the most organized person. Procrastination is a serious issue for me.  While I try to meet deadlines, I often struggle with time management and staying focused, especially with homework assignments.  The lack of a reliable computer has definitely made things harder.  However, I tend to rely on last-minute bursts of energy to get things done. I sometimes feel stressed due to this, but it works somehow.","Large social gatherings completely drain me. The sheer number of people and the constant stimulation are exhausting.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to; even then, my shyness might make me appear distant. I've made some friends, but I find it tiring to maintain close relationships. Even though I try.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my opinions to myself or just go along to avoid any confrontation. I prioritize maintaining harmony and peaceful relationships;  I don't like making waves.

The one exception might be trying the bus service, but even that's a fleeting thought.","I'm surprisingly conscientious when it comes to deadlines.  I managed to finish this assignment, even if it involved a lot of procrastination and internal conflict (like wondering if I should cheat on my girlfriend!).  Sticking to the timeframe was more about avoiding negative consequences (failing the assignment, disappointing my parents) than any deep-seated drive for self-improvement.","Being around lots of people can be draining. I mentioned wishing my girlfriend were here, indicating that having close companions is energizing.  The library seems to be a place filled with people I don't know which makes me feel quiet and drained.

My initial motivation was to keep my options open for business school, but ultimately, I'm starting to wonder if a career in business is really what I want.","Maintaining a good GPA to get into business school and study abroad is a huge goal of mine.  It’s definitely a long-term commitment, and I know I need to be disciplined. My approach involves trying to balance my studies with my other interests, though I’m definitely struggling with managing my time effectively right now. The physics lab grade is a setback, and it's stressful thinking about how that might affect my future goals.","Going out with my roommate to eat is something I generally look forward to; a break from studying and the repetitive food at my dorm.

I handle conflict by trying to understand different perspectives, even if I don't always agree with them.  My priority is finding a way that works for me, though I am quite worried about the future.","My cold and the stress of school are making me feel quite anxious. I initially respond to stress by getting a bit down and overwhelmed, like I am now; I take a dayquill to lessen my symptoms.

My crew team training is a good example – I'll work out when I feel like it, but my motivation is sporadic.

The essay reflects my drive for success and building relationships,  showing my dedication to school (despite my complaints) and my desire to make plans with friends.  I try to manage my time effectively, but sometimes school and extracurricular activities leave me stressed.  Although I struggle with balancing the workload, I persevere.","Social situations can be draining.  The essay shows my need for connection with loved ones, but also expresses feeling overwhelmed by the number of people at college. I like spending time with close friends like G.J. and Anthony but large groups exhaust me.  Quality time with a few special people is much more energizing than large gatherings.","I tend to avoid confrontation. The essay shows I'm hurt by G.J.'s behavior, but haven't directly addressed it.

Direct conflict is something I try to avoid.","I get stressed easily.  The essay is full of worries and anxieties about friends, school, and relationships.

I'm more reactive than proactive, and often struggle to consistently dedicate myself to something that demands sustained effort. My lack of planning is evident in my emotional response to the essay topic.  I tend to procrastinate, even though I know it's not helpful in the long run.","Large social gatherings drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I trust. The news about Audrey made me feel completely emotionally drained.  Processing such a massive tragedy is draining, not an experience I would say I am energized by.

It broadened my musical horizons, and I'm always looking for similar experiences.","I'm working on becoming more organized and efficient.  I've been trying to use a planner to keep track of my assignments and appointments.  It's a challenge to stick to it every day, but I'm making progress.

I make lists, set deadlines, and break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  Staying on track isn't usually a problem for me; however, the challenge comes with my girlfriend.

I get energy from teamwork and shared experiences. The essay mentions my excitement about the basketball season and interacting with my coach and teammates, showcasing my extraverted side.","I seem to be pretty agreeable, judging by my essay.  Even though there's the potential for friction (being a male manager on a female team), I express optimism about getting along with others. The focus is on cooperation and finding solutions rather than conflict.","I don't appear particularly neurotic in the essay. While there's some stress around practical matters (like finding a bed) or uncertainty (about pay), there's no evidence of significant anxiety or emotional distress. The tone is mostly matter-of-fact, even when describing challenges.",n,n,y,y,n
732,"I’ve never considered myself particularly adventurous, but writing this stream-of-consciousness essay is a new experience.  I was motivated by the assignment's requirement, though honestly, my initial interest lay in deciphering its hidden purpose, rather than the activity itself.  Afterward, I feel…neutral, I guess.  It wasn't terrible, just…different.","I haven’t really set many goals that demand sustained effort, and even when I do, I tend to be pretty lax about how I go about them. Time management isn’t really my forte, as you might have noticed from my rambling essay and my concern about my hunger overriding my task at hand.  If there are challenges, I’ll either put the task off or find ways to simplify it, reducing the demand on my time and energy.","Social interactions mostly drain me. I tend to prefer my own company, and spending time with others is something that I need in moderation.  Large gatherings or even sustained one-on-one conversations can leave me feeling tired and needing time to decompress. The fulfilling ones are usually brief and involve people I'm comfortable with.","Disagreements aren’t something I actively seek out, but they do happen. I tend to avoid direct confrontation and often let things slide unless they really bother me. My priority is usually to minimize conflict, even if it means compromising my own viewpoint.  I’m not one for heated debates or arguing my point aggressively.","I get stressed easily, especially when faced with time constraints and unclear expectations.  My initial response is often to procrastinate or get distracted, which doesn't help.  However, I usually manage to pull myself together, focusing on the task at hand, to get things done—but that’s only if I’m able to avoid getting too distracted or caught up in other thoughts.",y,n,n,n,n
733,"I'm not someone who jumps into drastically new things without a lot of thought; I prefer the familiar and comfortable.  However, starting college in Austin was a huge change—a new city, new people, and a completely different environment from my life back home in San Antonio. While initially apprehensive, the excitement of a fresh start ultimately propelled me to embrace this change.  Looking back, I felt a mix of exhilaration and stress, but overall it was a necessary step.","I'm not naturally organized.  My goal of succeeding in college feels overwhelming at times.  Time management is a struggle, and I often find myself juggling multiple things at once without a solid plan. I rely on sheer willpower and bursts of energy to get things done rather than a structured approach.  This has led to stress, but it’s also pushed me to discover my own ways of dealing with it, like exercise.","Being surrounded by friendly-looking girls energizes me; it makes me feel accepted and less alone in this brand new, overwhelming situation.  The opposite happens when I feel isolated.  I crave social interaction but it has to be with the right people; I need connections that feel genuine and comfortable, otherwise I feel drained.  This experience has made me realize how important choosing quality interactions is over quantity.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground and to keep things positive.  I prioritize maintaining good relationships and avoiding confrontation. My own anxieties often make resolving disagreements challenging, and I often internalize things rather than expressing my disagreements outright.","Starting college has been incredibly stressful.  The initial response was a mix of anxiety and self-doubt. To cope, I rely on physical activity like kickboxing—it helps to release tension.  Reaching out to friends like Veronica offers some comfort.  However, my anxiety often prevents me from tackling tasks head-on, and my thoughts race a million miles a minute.",n,n,y,y,n
734,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences lately; my focus has been adjusting to college.  The biggest change has been the sheer volume of reading required, which is a far cry from my previous academic experiences. While initially daunting, I'm finding ways to manage it.  I’m not sure if I would call it an enjoyable experience, but it is certainly challenging.","Managing my time in college has been a significant challenge. I'm tackling the overwhelming reading load by breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks and sticking to a study schedule, though it's not always easy to follow.  My main strategy is discipline and consistency, but spontaneity sometimes wins over. I find the rewarding aspect to be the accomplishment of completing the reading, while the challenging part is maintaining focus and avoiding procrastination.","Going to the football game and the subsequent party was a really energizing social experience.  Being surrounded by people, even after a loss, felt invigorating and reaffirmed my preference for social interaction, especially within a group.  The energy from the crowd, even in defeat, was infectious and uplifting.","My disagreement with my friends about joining a fraternity is something I've wrestled with.  My approach is to be upfront and respectful of their decisions, even if different from my own. I value their friendship, so I've tried to resolve conflict through open communication and mutual respect, prioritizing maintaining our relationships over forcing agreement.","The pressure of adjusting to college, making new friends, and handling a demanding academic workload has been stressful.  My initial response was anxiety, but I've tried to cope through productive activity, like focusing on my studies and working out. My strategy is to channel my anxieties into something productive rather than allowing them to cripple me, although this process is ongoing.",n,y,y,y,n
735,"I haven't really had the opportunity to explore drastically different activities or ways of thinking since starting college.  My focus has been primarily on adapting to this new environment and succeeding academically, which has left little time for major experimentation.  However, joining a sorority was a step outside my comfort zone, though not something radically different from my high school involvement. I'm still evaluating whether this was the right choice and what parts of it benefit me or not.","My goal of maintaining a high GPA in college requires significant time management.  I've created a study schedule, utilize planners, and prioritize assignments based on deadlines and difficulty.  While I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the workload and my own disorganized nature, I remind myself of the importance of achieving my academic goals and I want to get into the honors business program. It's rewarding to see my progress but definitely a constant challenge keeping all my schoolwork straight.","Joining a sorority has been a highly energizing social experience.  I enjoy the camaraderie and social interactions, which contrast with my feelings of being overwhelmed in large lecture classes.  This experience reaffirmed my need for close relationships and smaller, more intimate social settings, even though I can usually hold my own in most social settings.","I haven't experienced major disagreements since starting college, but I anticipate these will emerge as I navigate group projects and sorority activities.  My priority in resolving conflict would be to understand the other person's perspective first before explaining my viewpoint. If I can't resolve it I'd let it go, my own personal goals are much more important to me.","The transition to college has been somewhat stressful. The large class sizes and uncertainty about my future career path have contributed to some anxiety. I combat this by keeping busy, focusing on my studies and sorority commitments.  I also rely on the support of my family and friends and find that staying connected to them helps to alleviate my stress.",n,y,y,n,n

Sticking to what I know feels safer.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals. I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, fueled by anxiety about failing.  Time management isn't my strength; I'm much better at reacting to deadlines than planning ahead. The pressure of impending failure is my only motivator.",Being around large groups of people is exhausting. I find it difficult to keep up conversations and make small talk.  I much prefer spending time alone or with one or two close friends. I recharge best in solitude; social events leave me drained and feeling inadequate.,"Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I often avoid confrontation, even when I strongly disagree with someone.  Maintaining the peace is more important than asserting myself. I'd rather avoid conflict, even if it means swallowing my feelings.","I experience anxiety frequently, especially when faced with new or challenging situations. My initial response is often avoidance and procrastination, which only intensifies the anxiety. To cope, I sometimes isolate myself; this way I do not have to interact with others while I deal with my anxiety.  While I recognize that this isn't healthy, it feels safer than opening myself up to potential judgment or rejection.",n,n,y,n,y
737,I rarely try new things; I tend to stick to what I know and am comfortable with.  The thought of trying something completely different makes me anxious.  My preference for the familiar reflects a lack of interest in exploring unconventional ideas or experiences.,"I struggle with consistently pursuing long-term goals. My time management is often disorganized, and I frequently procrastinate. While I have aspirations, the follow-through is inconsistent; I often abandon projects before completion due to a lack of motivation.  Sustained effort is something I consistently find challenging.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well.  Memorable social experiences are typically one-on-one interactions, not crowded parties or events. My introversion isn't necessarily a negative; I value my independence and solitude.","Disagreements are uncomfortable, and I often avoid conflict.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own needs or opinions. Confrontation is something I usually attempt to escape. I'm not naturally assertive, even when I strongly feel my opinion has merit.","Stress and anxiety frequently overwhelm me.  My initial response is often avoidance and withdrawal.  Managing these feelings requires conscious effort, often involving solitude and mental strategies to help calm myself.

738,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Honestly, trying new things feels risky and uncomfortable to me.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone is more stressful than the potential reward. I prefer familiarity and things I already understand.","I struggle with long-term goals.  It's hard for me to stay focused and motivated.  I usually start with good intentions, but I get easily sidetracked. Structure and planning aren’t really my strengths.  I often find that the effort outweighs the reward.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained. Large groups, especially, are overwhelming and anxiety-provoking. I prefer smaller gatherings or one-on-one interactions with people I'm comfortable with. I find that too much social interaction can quickly become exhausting for me.","When I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid direct confrontation. It's easier to just keep my opinions to myself and hope for the best, even if that means not getting my needs met.  I often prioritize keeping the peace over expressing my own perspective, even if I think they're wrong.","This movie is really getting to me! I'm incredibly anxious watching it. My body is itching all over, and I have intense physical reactions to the scary scenes. The fear makes me feel really physically unwell; this is a pretty normal response for me when I'm stressed.",n,n,n,y,y
739,"I'm not sure I'd describe myself as someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  The essay shows some uncertainty about things like pageants. While I enjoy college life and the newfound freedom it offers, I tend to prefer familiarity and predictability. I'm comfortable with what I know.","I’m quite organized when it comes to academics.  The essay mentions prioritizing my math quiz over a social event; preparing for that test takes precedence.  I'm aware of my time constraints and manage them effectively to meet deadlines. I'm focused on schoolwork, but it does seem I am a bit indecisive sometimes.","I enjoy social interaction with certain people and in specific contexts. The essay shows some frustration with having to initiate conversations, suggesting that I prefer some level of reciprocation.  I value close relationships and prefer intimate gatherings over large, noisy events. I can be energized by meaningful conversations with friends but find excessive socializing draining.","I generally strive to be agreeable, but the essay reveals some underlying conflict avoidance. I'm thoughtful in my approach to disagreements, but prioritizing my own needs may come before total resolution. I might avoid direct confrontation, potentially at the cost of clearly stating my own feelings.","I experience stress and anxiety, as evidenced by my internal conflict about going to a meeting, and my anxiety about others not reaching out to me.  I handle these feelings by internalizing and ruminating, which can be a maladaptive coping mechanism. The essay mentions several worries and anxieties.  While I don't explicitly discuss my coping mechanisms, it seems that I focus on my schoolwork as a distraction.",n,y,y,y,n
740,"I auditioned for a lead role in a college theater production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" even though I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue theater as a career.  The motivation was to test my abilities and see how far I could push myself. The experience was ultimately rewarding and helped me to further explore my creative side.","Getting my college application essays written on time, despite significant technological setbacks (losing the first two drafts to computer issues!), was a significant challenge.  I leveraged my friend's computer, and prioritized finishing the essay, even if it meant working late into the night.   This taught me the importance of planning ahead and seeking out creative solutions to overcome obstacles.  The rewarding part was successfully submitting my essay and feeling proud that I had persisted despite the technical difficulties.","Spending time with my new friends at UT, talking about trivial things like a friend's haircut, was a very energizing experience.  The lighthearted banter and shared laughter created a positive and uplifting atmosphere. This reaffirmed my enjoyment of social interactions with people I feel comfortable around.","My friends wanted to order pizza while I was working on my essay. Even though I was hungry and wanted to eat, I focused on finishing my writing, as it was important to me to complete my assignment. I communicated my desire to work while also making time for the pizza later.","When my computer kept crashing and I lost my essay twice, I initially felt stressed and frustrated.

The idea of creating something tangible with my hands appealed to me, a welcome distraction from the usual chaos in my head. I enjoyed the process, though the finished product wasn't exactly a masterpiece; it was a nice change of pace.","Setting and maintaining goals is a constant struggle.  The pressure to succeed, coupled with my anxieties, makes it difficult.  I often start strong but lose momentum easily, veering between intense focus and crippling apathy.  My biggest challenge is combating procrastination, and any success feels like a small victory in a large war against myself.","Large social gatherings completely drain me. The noise, the constant interaction, it’s overwhelming. On the other hand, spending time with one or two close friends can be energizing, even if it's just quiet company.  I think this highlights my need for genuine connection over superficial interactions.","Disagreements are uncomfortable, yet unavoidable. I try to approach them calmly, listening to the other person's perspective even if I don't agree with it. Ultimately, I prioritize maintaining a respectful relationship; if that means compromising my own preferences, then I will likely do that, if the relationship is worthwhile.","Stress and anxiety are almost constant companions.

I find comfort in things I already know and understand, rather than venturing into the unknown.","I'm not the most organized person.  I had to go to church later in the day because I overslept. That’s about the extent of my goal-setting.  I don't really plan things out meticulously; I tend to react to things as they happen.  I’m more focused on dealing with immediate problems and less on long-term planning, I guess.",Social situations can be draining. The fight with my girlfriend was definitely exhausting.

While I wouldn't describe myself as a thrill-seeker, the sheer necessity of adapting to a completely new setting and academic workload has, in a way, been an experiment in openness.  I've found myself surprisingly resilient in facing these challenges, though I sometimes long for the comfort of my old high school routine.","Becoming valedictorian required intense dedication and organization.  I meticulously planned my time, utilizing planners and to-do lists to ensure I stayed on top of my assignments.  Procrastination was my biggest challenge, and I developed strategies to overcome it, such as breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. While rewarding in the end, the pressure I put on myself was sometimes overwhelming.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy.  I find smaller, more intimate settings much more fulfilling.  The constant stimulation of a large group, even if it's a fun event, can leave me feeling mentally and physically exhausted.  This experience has reinforced my preference for quality interactions over quantity.","I recently had a conflict with my biology teaching assistant. His inability to communicate effectively frustrated me, and I found myself wanting to speak up.  However, understanding his background as a foreign student made me prioritize empathy. Instead of directly confronting him, I tried to approach the situation with kindness and patience. I believe that helping him feel better would ultimately facilitate my understanding of the material.","The transition to college has been incredibly stressful.  The workload, unfamiliar environment, and my own high expectations have left me feeling overwhelmed and anxious.

Getting my Jeep upgraded takes a lot of time and money, but I just work on it as I can and don't worry too much about a strict schedule.

I felt pressured into it and now regret the decision because it's exhausting and takes up a lot of time. It's definitely not something I'd actively seek out again.","I’m not the most organized person. I often struggle to meet deadlines, and my approach to managing time is…flexible, to say the least.  The orchestra is a prime example – I signed up without thinking about the time commitment. I haven't really developed any effective strategies to stay on track with long-term projects. I don’t really consider the orchestra as a long term project though; I'm just trying to get through it.","Large social gatherings completely drain me.  The orchestra rehearsal is a perfect example. Being around so many people for so long, and having the added pressure of performing, leaves me feeling depleted and irritable.  Quiet time alone is essential for me to recharge. I value close relationships more than big groups.","I generally try to avoid conflict. I'm pretty good at going with the flow and not making waves, especially with people I care about.  I value my relationships and will work to keep things positive. I didn’t even tell the orchestra director I didn't want to be there.","I tend to overthink things, and that can easily lead to stress and anxiety.

While college is a big change, it wasn't something wildly outside my comfort zone; it was a logical next step.  My excitement stemmed from achieving a pre-defined goal (getting into UT) and being with my best friend, not from the novelty itself.","Getting into UT and navigating the move-in process clearly show my conscientiousness.  The essay highlights my organized nature (though initially overwhelmed by unpacking), and my commitment to extracurriculars in high school demonstrates a capacity for long-term effort.  The challenge of moving and organizing my dorm room was overcome through methodical unpacking and multiple rearrangements until I was satisfied. My parents' help was appreciated but I took the lead in achieving my vision.","The move-in day was draining, despite the excitement of being with my best friend. The crowded, hot hallways and long elevator wait were overwhelming, which would be expected given my extraverted personality. The essay reflects my preference for positive social interaction with friends and a dislike of chaotic, stressful social situations. Finding the right social environment, like my classes and eventually my dorm, replenished my energy.","The essay doesn't directly describe conflicts, but my behavior during the move-in process suggests a collaborative and agreeable nature.  I sought help from my parents, worked with my best friend to organize the room, and ultimately focused on creating a positive environment despite the initial stress.  I prioritized cooperation and understanding over potential conflict.","The move-in day was undeniably stressful; the disorganized space and the heat triggered feelings of frustration and a desire to cry.  However, the essay emphasizes my ability to manage the situation, actively reorganizing my room until satisfied.

I was surprised by how much it helped my understanding of the material, and it made me feel much more confident and prepared for class.","I haven't been great at time management or sticking to goals. I'm trying to improve, but I struggle with sustained effort. The essay shows my attempts to improve my schoolwork by reading assignments and how my dad's work ethic has influenced me, but also my distractibility and procrastination. I often get sidetracked, like thinking about that cute girl in music theory rather than focusing on my studies.","Asking that girl in my music theory class out this weekend would be a memorable social experience. I'm generally pretty outgoing (the essay mentions my desire to become a music educator) and I am energized by social interactions, especially those with people I find interesting.  However,  the lack of my car impacting my social plans shows that even though I’m extraverted, I still need logistics in place for me to be able to fully engage socially.","I haven't explicitly addressed a disagreement in the essay, but my description of my band director and my chemistry teacher implies that I am able to handle disagreement constructively, even if I am critical of them. My focus would be on evaluating their teaching methods and pointing out areas for improvement, rather than being confrontational. I believe in constructive feedback.","My ADD causes my mind to wander, which can be frustrating, and I mention this as an annoyance. The essay shows that I am not high in neuroticism. I generally manage these distractions by focusing on something else which momentarily distracts me, as seen in my example of thinking about the girl in my music theory class.  While I acknowledge it as annoying, I don't seem to experience extreme levels of anxiety or stress due to it.",y,n,y,y,n

I suppose moving out of my mother's house was a big change, but it wasn't something I actively *chose* so much as something I needed to do to get away from a bad environment. It was definitely a positive change and I feel much better now.","I've struggled with conscientiousness.  My past is evidence of that; my bad grades and irresponsible behavior were a direct result of a lack of discipline. However, my current situation reflects improved self-discipline,  largely due to the positive influence of my father and stepmother.  Maintaining my college studies despite personal challenges is a testament to that improved self-discipline. The ongoing worry about my sisters is a significant challenge, but also a powerful motivator.","Social situations generally drain me. I prefer smaller, close-knit interactions with people I know and trust.  Large gatherings or interactions with strangers are very stressful and leave me feeling exhausted. The bond I have with my stepmother, for instance, is vital and energizing; it has taught me the importance of supportive relationships.  I am not energized by group activities or big parties.","I generally try to be agreeable, but I have strong feelings about my sisters' well-being. I worry constantly about their current environment and lack of supervision. I've had disagreements with my mother about her parenting style, but I haven't directly confronted her. My priority is to be a positive influence on my sisters, which sometimes means accepting difficult family dynamics.  Open confrontation would likely be harmful to everyone involved.","I'm a worrier. My anxiety is focused primarily on my younger sisters' safety and well-being.  The thought of them repeating my past mistakes is incredibly stressful.

My attempts often involved setting overly ambitious goals without any real planning or strategies for maintaining that. Usually I quit. I realized that establishing smaller, more achievable goals with built-in rewards helped, along with scheduling specific times in my week.  The biggest challenge was battling procrastination and maintaining my motivation on days when I felt less energetic.","A large, lively party once left me feeling completely drained, despite the jovial atmosphere. The constant stimulation and need for small talk proved exhausting; I realized that I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings where meaningful conversation can take precedence over superficial interactions. This experience solidified my preference for deeper connections over broad, shallow social engagements.","In a disagreement with a close friend, I focused on active listening and understanding their perspective before presenting my own.  My priority was preserving our friendship, so I aimed for a compromise that acknowledged both viewpoints, rather than forcing my own opinion upon them.  It was more important to find common ground than to 'win' the argument.","When facing a significant deadline, my anxiety frequently manifests as a racing mind and trouble sleeping.  To manage this, I engage in deep breathing exercises, prioritize tasks to reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed, and allow for breaks to avoid burnout.

I created a detailed schedule, using a planner and breaking down large assignments into smaller tasks. While I sometimes struggled to stick to it, the reward of graduating on time was worth the effort.  Staying organized and prioritizing tasks was key, though I occasionally fell behind.","Grandparent's 50th anniversary party—that was draining.  Being around so many people, especially when my speech didn't go as planned, was overwhelming. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings.

I rely on prayer and reflection to stay focused, and when challenges arise, I remind myself of my values and the support of my faith community. The reward of living in accordance with my beliefs is a deep sense of peace.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining, often depending on the level of intimacy.  Spending time with Jerome, someone I trust deeply, fills me with joy and calm.  Large group settings or situations where I feel judged tend to leave me feeling exhausted. This experience reaffirmed the importance of meaningful connections over superficial interactions and reinforced my need for quiet time to recharge after social events.","Disagreements, especially with those I care about, are challenging. When conflicts arise, my priority is to maintain respect and understanding. I try my best to articulate my point of view calmly and to truly listen to the other person's perspective. Finding common ground and focusing on shared values is my approach, sometimes even through silent prayer for guidance.","I occasionally feel overwhelmed by anxiety and stress, especially when concerned about my relationship with Jerome and my ability to live out my faith in a world that seems indifferent to spiritual matters.  When I feel this way, I turn to prayer and meditation to find solace and perspective. Spending time in nature, observing God's creation, also helps to ease my worries and restore a sense of peace.",y,y,n,y,n
753,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies, like experimenting with different programming languages or writing code that solves a unique challenge, like my mathematical expression evaluator.  The motivation comes from the intellectual stimulation and the satisfaction of creating something functional.  Afterwards, I feel a sense of accomplishment and am eager to apply this knowledge to further projects.","While I have many projects and ideas, my follow-through can be inconsistent. I often juggle multiple tasks, sometimes losing track of deadlines. My ability to sustain effort depends heavily on my interest in a particular task.  Rewarding experiences typically stem from successfully completing a complex project, while the challenge lies in maintaining focus and resisting distractions.","Social interactions are energizing when they involve shared interests, such as discussing coding projects or even complaining about malfunctioning air conditioners.  Draining interactions usually occur when I am forced into small talk or superficial conversations that lack intellectual depth. This shapes my preference for meaningful interactions over large, impersonal gatherings.","Disagreements are usually approached rationally; I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective before seeking to win an argument.  If the situation involves collaborative projects, I will attempt to find a compromise or solution that satisfies everyone involved.  My primary concern is efficiency and getting the job done.","Stress and anxiety are often triggered by time constraints and unmet expectations, like finishing assignments or meeting deadlines. My initial response is to become more focused to the point of neglecting other things (or doing the same things, but less efficiently). I manage this through active problem-solving and engaging in tasks I find relaxing, such as listening to music or spending time with my fiancee.",n,n,n,n,n

It was terrifying, but afterward, I felt a strange sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for the bravery of performers.  It made me realize I’m more adventurous than I give myself credit for.","I'm not the best at long-term planning. I set a goal to lose weight, and while I started strong with regular ab workouts, I found it hard to stick to a strict diet or exercise routine.  My time management is...flexible.  However, seeing the results on the scale motivated me to keep going, even if it wasn't always consistent.  The rewarding part was seeing the weight come off; the challenging aspect was maintaining consistency.","Going out with friends always energizes me.  The easy flow of conversation, laughter, and shared experiences—those are amazing.  Being around people who understand my humor and who I can easily connect with fills me up.  Conversely, forced social interactions or trying to engage with people I don't connect with can drain me pretty quickly. It taught me the importance of choosing my social settings and company wisely.","I try to be accommodating.  When I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground and avoid direct confrontation, at least initially.  My priority is maintaining a positive relationship, so I'll often compromise to keep the peace, even if it means swallowing some of my own opinions.  The main thing is to keep things pleasant.","I'm prone to anxiety.  When I get stressed, I tend to overthink things and get overwhelmed by my to-do list. This week has been a great example of this!  To cope, I rely on distraction—TV, talking to friends, cleaning, and eating. Sometimes I feel guilty about using these tactics, but sometimes you just need a break from whatever is stressing you out, even if it’s only temporary.",y,n,y,y,y

My essay shows a lot of concern about meeting deadlines (psychology test, writing assignment) and managing finances (plane ticket, motherboard). I prioritize planning and organization; it's reflected in my worry about timing. While challenged by distractions,  I persevere and prioritize important tasks.","Social interactions can be draining. The essay reveals a preference for solitude, expressing a desire to be alone and away from distractions.  Energetic social gatherings aren't my thing; quiet time is more appealing. My focus is more on personal tasks and goals than social interactions.",I tend to avoid conflict. The essay only hints at relationships without detailing any disagreements. My tendency leans towards avoiding confrontation and preserving relationships.  I avoid strong disagreements.,"I get anxious easily.

For example, I recently tried to learn a new video game, and even though I struggled at first, the challenge of mastering something new was strangely appealing. I didn't finish the game, but the process was exciting. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment even in failure. My boyfriend's visit is also a new thing I'm eager for.","I don't always excel at long-term planning; I'm more spontaneous. However, I did manage to find the time and motivation to pursue getting good at pinball (even if I didn't practice consistently).  This was more about a short-term goal, rather than a long-term one, as I am not the best at staying organized. There were certainly moments of procrastination, but I persevered.  The main challenge wasn't time management; it was more about battling my internal distractions and lack of focus.","Social situations can be both invigorating and draining for me. Being with my boyfriend is energizing; hanging out with him helps me recharge. On the other hand, large groups of people, particularly noisy ones, can be overwhelming, which is why I decided not to go to the rooftop party. The ideal social experience involves close, intimate interactions with people I care about in a comfortable setting.","I try to be agreeable, even if it's difficult. I generally prioritize maintaining harmony; I don't want to cause unnecessary conflict. For example, the people talking in the room where I am writing are distracting, but instead of confronting them, I'm choosing to tolerate the distraction and keep my focus on this writing prompt to avoid confrontation and maintain my focus on the goal at hand. This isn't my favorite, however, and I might respond differently in other situations.","I tend to experience anxiety and stress quite readily, particularly when overwhelmed. This essay is certainly causing me a level of stress as I find it difficult to stay focused, especially considering that the computer I am using has certain limitations. But instead of panicking, I try to focus on what I can control – this means to stay focused and just get this over with, as I am determined to finish.  I find that distracting myself with things I enjoy helps to calm my nerves and center myself.",y,n,y,y,y

While I wouldn't call it life-altering, it was a change of pace from my usual routine, and I enjoyed the competitiveness of the match. Afterward, it was a pleasant distraction from the stress of college work.","Getting through my college coursework is a constant goal requiring consistent effort. I prioritize assignments with imminent deadlines (like Calculus and Economics) to ensure I don't fall behind.  Procrastination is a challenge, particularly with boring subjects like Mythology. I try to manage my time, but it’s a work in progress.  The rewarding aspect is the satisfaction of completing a task, but the sheer volume of reading is overwhelming.","Social situations tend to drain me. While I enjoyed watching the tennis match,  it was a solitary activity.  Interactions that involve a lot of small talk or extensive engagement leave me feeling depleted.  I've learned I prefer quiet time to recharge and find fulfilling activities that don't require significant social interaction.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  When a conflict arises, such as when Southern Ivy's jockey disobeyed instructions, I try to focus on solutions but it can be frustrating.  My priority is to minimize conflict and find a way to move forward, often letting things go to maintain harmony and avoid confrontation.","Stress and anxiety are frequent feelings, especially concerning my college workload and the pressure to succeed.

The essay reflects this; I'm preoccupied with daily routines, people I know, and things I already understand.  Trying something completely new doesn't really cross my mind.","I'm not overly organized, as the rambling nature of my essay shows.  I do have some goals, like getting a haircut, but my approach is pretty relaxed. I don't meticulously plan or schedule. I let things happen organically, prioritizing immediate needs and desires over long-term planning.  The thought of a structured plan feels tedious and unnecessary.","Social interactions can be draining. The essay reveals my preference for brief interactions, even casual observations of others, rather than deep engagements. I’m more comfortable observing from a distance than initiating or sustaining lengthy conversations.  Large social gatherings likely leave me feeling overwhelmed.  I am not the type to be ""energized"" by social interaction.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid. The essay doesn’t show any major conflicts; instead, it focuses on personal observations and desires.  I would likely try to avoid confrontation, and if forced to engage, would probably be indirect in my approach. My personal needs and comfort often take precedence.","Stress and anxiety don’t seem to be major issues for me.  While the essay mentions some frustrations (like the wall outside my window), I don't dwell on these negative emotions.  I cope by focusing on immediate concerns and distractions, like thinking about the basketball game or going to the store. I don't seem to engage in deep introspection or self-analysis of my emotions.",n,y,n,n,n

I'm not sure if I'd call it enjoyable, but it has definitely made me think differently about relationships.","I struggle with procrastination, as evidenced by my delayed reading.  I have a goal of excelling academically, but I rely on last-minute cramming from high school, a strategy that clearly won't work in college. Although my girlfriend's birthday is coming up, I haven't sent the card yet, and my relationship is a constant source of stress and uncertainty. I am meeting with a successful person for advice and guidance, a decision driven by my goal of academic success.","Spending time with my friends, particularly those who pressure me to party, leaves me feeling drained. I prefer more intimate and quieter interactions. I find it hard to decline their invitations, which causes me stress and leaves me feeling conflicted.  I understand I need to set boundaries, but expressing them feels difficult.","I find it difficult to express my disagreement directly.  My girlfriend's ultimatum and controlling nature frustrate me, yet I find it tough to confront her about it without damaging our relationship.   I prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means suppressing my own opinions. While I can be assertive (debating experience), it's not something I choose to do often because it isn't congruent with my personality.","The pressure of college, my relationship, and parental disapproval creates a great deal of anxiety. My immediate response is often avoidance, like procrastinating on reading. To manage it, I distract myself with activities like watching MTV, and I seek comfort in visiting my mom.  While I understand these aren't the most constructive coping strategies, they feel like the easier option at the moment.",n,y,y,n,n

I've been pretty successful in establishing a routine that allows me to dedicate time to studies without sacrificing my newfound friendships and social life.  Staying organized and prioritizing tasks have been key. While it's been rewarding to see my success in school, finding a balance has been a constant challenge and I'm still learning.","Meeting a friend of my roommate's was definitely energizing.  The conversation flowed easily, we laughed a lot, and I felt comfortable being myself.  It showed me I thrive in social situations with genuine connection and shared humor.  I do prefer some alone time to recharge, but I crave these kinds of positive interactions.","My disagreement with Blake has been tough.  I prioritized open communication, but also had to respect his space. We were close, and I miss that closeness.  It's hard seeing him change, and I'm torn between addressing my concerns and accepting the distance. For now, I'm choosing to let things unfold naturally.","Senior year with Blake was definitely stressful.  The change in our friendship was hard and I initially felt quite anxious about it.  I tried talking to him about it, but our stubbornness got in the way. I've since tried to focus on the present, enjoying college and building new friendships.

I managed my time through intense self-discipline, balancing work, school, and my own self-study. It was challenging juggling everything and facing parental disapproval, but my commitment to my education helped me persevere.  The ultimate reward was my acceptance into the university, proving my self-reliance.",Social situations generally drain me. I prefer quiet evenings at home to large gatherings. Being around others often feels overwhelming and exhausting.  This introversion is partly why I've worked so hard to achieve my academic goals independently; it allows me to avoid a lot of potentially stressful social situations that I don't have the energy for.,"My parents and I strongly disagree about my future.  I prioritize my ambitions and independence, while they want me to follow more traditional paths.

My immediate reaction is worry and frustration, stemming from my lack of access to technology and the pressure of deadlines. To manage this, I'm trying to break down the task into smaller steps and focus on completing one step at a time.

I make lists (like the one about things to pick up when I go home), but often forget about them. Goals are more like desires than meticulously planned achievements.  I often let spontaneity dictate my actions.  If something seems interesting or important at the moment, I'll do it, but long-term planning isn't my strong suit.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends. I find energy in quiet moments and my own company, which is why I enjoy listening to my CDs and reflecting on my thoughts.

Direct confrontation makes me uncomfortable, so I’ll often avoid it or simply acquiesce to avoid conflict.","Stress and anxiety don't affect me too dramatically. I tend to just keep going about my day, sometimes even forgetting my worries. When faced with a stressful situation, I find that distracting myself with music or other activities helps me cope.

Afterward, I felt strangely at peace, even though I had no real conclusion to draw from my observation.","Goals and I don't often get along.  I set out to help Shannon blow up her air sofa, which was a short-lived goal.  Time management? Ha! That's not exactly something I excel at. I tend to work in spurts, tackling things when I get to them, often leaving things till the last minute. I usually end up finishing whatever I started, though, and that works for me.","Hanging out with my friends from Houston would definitely be energizing.  That's the sort of social interaction I crave.  Being around people who share my interests and are easygoing revitalizes me.

Ultimately, I place a high value on maintaining amicable relationships.","I don't stress about things too much, honestly. My main sources of stress stem from uncertainty about relationships. If things don't go my way, I’ll typically dwell on it for a bit.

The prospect is exciting, even if slightly daunting.","I'm not the most organized person.  While I believe college will pay off in the long run, I haven't established a strict schedule or study plan.

While initially challenging, the act of committing to and completing it felt surprisingly rewarding, proving that a change in routine could yield positive results.","I've always struggled with procrastination, a habit I blame on a combination of upbringing and cultural influences. Setting goals requiring sustained effort has been particularly difficult.  This essay was a goal of sorts, and I found myself constantly distracted by competing impulses (swimming, emailing family, etc.). My approach was essentially to force myself to start, and my 'strategy' was more like a blind leap of faith than a methodically planned effort. While I finished, the experience confirmed my lack of planning skills but also highlighted a desire for improvement.","The social experience of being around others in the co-op is usually energizing for me.  The casual interactions, shared space, and potential for spontaneous conversations are usually really fulfilling, offering a sense of connection and vitality.  However, spending too long alone, like the prolonged period since school, leaves me feeling drained and mentally sluggish.  Writing this, which is a solitary activity, is also tiring. The contrast between these two extremes reinforces my need for balance: social interaction and personal reflection, but in moderation.","I haven't had a significant disagreement recently but based on past experiences, my priority in conflicts is to maintain harmony and understanding. I generally try to find common ground, avoid confrontation, and focus on listening to the other person's perspective before voicing my own.  This approach isn't always the most direct path to resolution, but maintaining positive relationships is essential to me.","The overwhelming feeling of having nothing to do after school left me feeling quite anxious and stressed. Initially, the stress was overwhelming. Instead of focusing on the root of my anxiety (my unstructured time and what to do), I avoided the issue by jumping into various distracting activities and only focusing on the assignment under pressure to complete it.

This experience reinforced my preference for more intimate social settings.","I haven't encountered any significant disagreements yet, though the fire drill made me slightly resentful towards whoever pulled the alarm unnecessarily.  I'd probably address any future conflict by trying to understand the other person's perspective. However, right now, I'm prioritizing getting through my studies and settling into my new environment.","The overwhelming workload and the early morning classes are definitely causing stress. My initial response is irritation and a sense of being overwhelmed. To manage it, I’m trying to stick to a routine and get my assignments done.  However, I'm still grappling with the initial shock of a completely new academic environment.",n,y,y,y,n
772,"Last summer, on a whim, I decided to try rock climbing.  I'd always been intimidated by heights, but a friend convinced me to give it a shot.  The challenge of conquering the wall was exhilarating, and despite my initial fear, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment afterward. It was a far cry from my usual routine and opened me up to a new perspective on physical challenges.","I’m not exactly known for my planning skills. My college goals, for instance, were ambitious but lacked any realistic timeline or action plan.  I tend to jump into things without sufficient forethought.  This usually leads to me scrambling to catch up, which, to be honest, I’ve learned to embrace as part of my process. The essay was due yesterday, yet here I am, writing it now.  It's more of a chaotic approach, but it works for me (or at least, that's what I tell myself).","Being around large groups of people for extended periods really drains my energy.  I enjoy social interaction, but prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I'm close to. I find big, loud parties overwhelming;  I'd rather have a meaningful conversation with a couple of friends than deal with the superficiality and noise of a crowded room.  I value quality over quantity when it comes to social connections.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with.  Disagreements tend to bring out my critical side.  I’ll often challenge what someone says, even if it’s to someone's face. I’m not afraid to voice my opinions, even when they differ from others'. While I can be assertive in conflicts, my approach is more about expressing my perspective clearly and honestly rather than trying to ""win"" the argument.","Procrastination is my main coping mechanism for stress. As you can see from this essay, I'm not always great at time management. When deadlines loom and I feel overwhelmed, I tend to avoid the task, sometimes until the last possible minute.  It's not a healthy strategy, but it's my go-to.  The anxiety and self-criticism that follow don't help, either.",y,n,y,n,n
773,"I decided to apply to UT, even though it wasn't the ""amazing, just right school"" my friends were going to.  It was a safe bet, a way to ensure I got in somewhere.  The experience has been... interesting, I guess.  I like my dorm room; it feels like home, which is surprising.","Getting into UT was a goal, and I achieved it without much planning. Applying only there was an easy choice, maybe not the most conscientious one, but it worked.  I didn't really manage my time and resources; it was more about making the easiest path to a successful outcome.",Going to the dining hall alone is... okay.  I like having my own space.  I don't think I'm a particularly social person; being alone doesn't bother me.  Maybe I’d rather sing to myself than engage in small talk. This experience shows I don't require constant interaction.,"My girlfriend's going to New York, and I'm grappling with that.  I'm conflicted about my feelings.  My priorities are centered on understanding my feelings, resolving the issues I have with the situation.  It's definitely causing internal conflict and potentially external conflict if I don’t address my feelings.","My girlfriend leaving made me feel abandoned.  I'm also stressed about the uncertainty of my feelings toward her and my future.  I'm coping by writing this, exploring my thoughts and feelings.  I'm also looking for ways to replace ""that feeling of completeness"".",y,y,y,y,n
774,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  My weekends spent with friends are pretty much my routine, and I'm happiest sticking to what I know. The only slightly new thing recently was my boyfriend visiting – that was nice, though.  I prefer familiarity and predictability.","I'm not the most organized person.  Goals?  Yeah, I have them, but sticking to a plan isn't really my strong suit. I tend to procrastinate, and my time management isn't great.  Honestly, I just kind of wing it and hope for the best, which often leads to stress, like with that pretesting survey.","Last weekend with my friends and boyfriend was amazing!  Being around people I love, laughing, and having fun really energizes me.  It's a great recharge for me, whereas dealing with frustrating things like computer problems totally drains me. I thrive on social interaction with close friends and loved ones.","I usually try to avoid conflict. If there's a disagreement, I try to be understanding and go with the flow,  even if I don't entirely agree. Keeping the peace is important to me.  My focus is on maintaining positive relationships, even if it means compromising my own viewpoints sometimes.","This whole day has been super stressful!  The website issue, my overloaded schedule, even the uncomfortable chair – it all adds up.  My initial reaction is usually frustration and avoidance, like putting off my homework.  I usually try to distract myself, which helps sometimes, but ultimately I just want to relax and see my friends to feel better.",y,n,y,y,n
775,"I started taking a psychology class this semester, which was completely outside my usual comfort zone. I was motivated by curiosity – the professor seemed interesting, and the subject matter intrigued me, although some of it was a bit overwhelming.  While initially intimidated by the sheer volume of new information, I found the class engaging and have discovered a new interest.","I haven't really set any long-term goals that require much sustained effort. I am more focused on enjoying my current relationships, which includes making time to see my boyfriend Brandon whenever possible. My time management skills aren’t exactly top-notch; I often find myself procrastinating.  I often wish I had the discipline to read all my assignments fully, but I tend to let things slide, especially when other things are on my mind.","Sitting next to Matt in class was a draining social experience.  His behavior shifts dramatically depending on who is around. I felt uncomfortable with the close proximity and his inconsistent behavior. I prefer quiet, intimate settings and get easily overwhelmed in larger social situations.","I haven't had many big disagreements, but I sometimes feel uncomfortable when others are mean or inconsiderate, as Alden has sometimes been to me.  My priority is to maintain relationships, even with those who challenge me; I avoid direct confrontation and tend to internalize the negativity.","My anxiety often manifests around social situations and uncertainty.  For example, I'm feeling nervous about meeting with Leslie Thomas, and I constantly worry about whether or not people like me.  My initial response to these feelings is avoidance, but I am trying to force myself to go forward with things anyway. I sometimes overthink and create anxieties for myself.",y,n,n,y,y
776,"I've always been drawn to music, especially ska, but finding good ska is surprisingly difficult.  Recently, I decided to try learning to play the guitar to create my own music.  The motivation was primarily to express myself creatively and escape the stress of other things in my life, like being dropped from the journalism program.  Overall, it's been a positive experience, although it's a work in progress.","I struggle with time management; I often find myself juggling multiple things simultaneously, such as working on lyrics for my band, The Pinfields, while dealing with the pressures of university.  I don't always have effective strategies to stay on track.  My approach is more reactive than proactive.  The challenge is feeling overwhelmed by my commitments; the reward is the creative outlet, though sometimes I question whether it's a good use of my time.","I find most social interactions draining, especially larger gatherings. A memorable experience would be a party where I felt overwhelmingly stressed out and ended up escaping early, finding solitude to be more fulfilling and energizing than the social event. This confirmed my preference for smaller groups or one-on-one interactions, and I recognize my need for alone time to recharge.","I often find myself disagreeing with people, especially when those people seem to have no self-awareness or empathy for my position. I typically avoid direct confrontation, though, prioritizing de-escalation and maintaining a calm demeanor. My priority in resolving conflict is to diffuse the tension, even if it means compromising my own ideas or preferences, to try and avoid any escalation.","The essay itself pretty well details one of my many highly anxious experiences. I initially respond to stress with a flood of disorganized thoughts and self-criticism. To cope, I sometimes use techniques like focusing on a single point of concentration, and/or I try to avoid self-blame. While it's not always effective, it helps to temporarily escape the overwhelming negative thoughts.",y,n,n,n,y
777,"I wouldn't say I've ever actively sought out something completely new.  My life feels more like a stream of whatever happens next. But, I guess starting college was a big change. It was motivated by societal expectation and the promise of a better future—though right now, I'm questioning that. It’s both exciting and overwhelming, like the essay I’m forced to write now.","I'm not great at planning.  I set goals – like getting good grades – but staying on track is a struggle. I tend to procrastinate, and only really buckle down when a deadline is looming.  I have fleeting moments of intense focus, but mostly I just react to whatever’s urgent at the moment.  The rewarding part is the feeling of relief once it's over.","Large social gatherings completely drain me. I enjoy the company of close friends – like Katie and Kelly – but being surrounded by tons of people, especially at loud parties, makes me want to hide.  Fulfilling interactions involve comfortable conversations with people I connect with, not superficial interactions at a frat party.  Being alone helps me recharge.","I avoid direct confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I'll likely try to ignore the issue or find a way to compromise.  My priority is to avoid conflict, even if that means suppressing my own opinions or needs.  I'm easily swayed.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  I get overwhelmed quickly.  My initial response is to avoid the source of my stress. Sometimes, that involves procrastination (like with this essay!), other times it's finding a distraction (like playing pool). I also have the tendency to overthink things; my mind races when stressed.",n,y,n,n,y
778,"I'm considering learning sign language.  The idea of communicating with and helping deaf individuals appeals to me, and it feels like a completely new and challenging way to expand my horizons.  I'm motivated by the potential to connect with others and learn a new skill.  I haven't started yet, but I'm excited about the prospect.","I'm aiming for a PhD, which requires a lot of dedication and planning.  To stay on track, I'm trying to create a structured schedule—balancing my studies, diet (I’ve lost 17 lbs!), and exercise (a mile a day!). I do worry about tests and grades; however, my concern motivates me to study. The challenge is the sheer amount of work, but the reward would be achieving my academic goals.","Going home for a wedding would probably be draining. I am concerned about seeing my parents and already feel stressed by the social aspects of college. This experience has highlighted my preference for quieter, more controlled social interactions rather than large or overly stimulating ones.","The essay doesn't depict a direct disagreement, but my internal conflict about attending the wedding suggests a potential tension between pleasing others (my family) and my own desire for quiet time and focus on my studies. I might try to find a compromise that balances both needs.","I feel anxious about school, specifically the academic demands and social pressures. My initial response is worry, but I'm trying to manage this by creating a study plan, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and reaching out for support. (Though not explicitly mentioned in the essay, it seems clear that I am experiencing emotional stress, based on my worries about grades, parents, and my overall emotional state.)",y,y,y,n,n
779,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  College has been a pretty jarring shift from what I expected, and I haven't really sought out anything dramatically different. My focus has been more on navigating my current relationships and responsibilities, rather than exploring uncharted territory.","I'm definitely not the most organized person.  I've fallen behind in my schoolwork, and I struggle to manage my time effectively.  I know I *should* be doing things, like studying for that lifeguard test or finding a car, but I often lack the motivation to follow through.  That lifeguard test is a looming deadline, though, so I might finally get my act together.","Socializing is a mixed bag for me. Spending time with my high school buddies is familiar and comfortable, but I crave more interaction with new people. I also worry a lot about my relationship with Katie. While I find comfort in those close to me, being around large groups or constantly interacting with people is exhausting and anxiety-inducing.","I’m not always good at handling disagreements. My relationship with Katie is a prime example. We constantly fight, and it's difficult to find common ground.  Avoiding conflict is usually my first instinct, especially when dealing with people I care about; confrontation isn't something I naturally seek out.","I definitely experience stress and anxiety.  The upcoming lifeguard test, my relationship issues, and my general lack of direction all contribute to my worries. I'm not exactly proactive in managing my stress; often I avoid dealing with problems directly, finding distractions in things like TV or spending time with friends, but ultimately, this avoidance just makes the anxiety worse.",n,n,y,n,n

Despite initial loneliness, I've discovered a fondness for the diversity here, finding that ""different is good.""","My goal of succeeding in college requires juggling readings and managing my time effectively. However, I often find myself distracted by my thoughts and emotions, making it difficult to stay on track with my academic commitments. I haven't yet developed a robust system for time management, so I often feel overwhelmed and behind.","Spending time with my family over Labor Day was incredibly energizing.  The strong connections and shared laughter left me feeling fulfilled. Conversely, when I'm alone, especially early in my college life, feelings of loneliness can be draining.  I'm beginning to understand the balance between needing social connection and appreciating alone time.","My relationship with Mando is complex, causing internal conflict and disagreements. I want to maintain the connection, but it's become overwhelmingly consuming. Finding a balance between honoring my feelings and communicating these needs healthily is a constant challenge.","The uncertainty about the future, my relationship, and adjusting to college life generates substantial stress and anxiety.

It was a completely new environment and a way of life I hadn’t experienced before, and while it was initially frightening, the idea of finding a sense of belonging and making new friends pushed me to do it.  Looking back, it's been overwhelmingly positive.","I'm definitely trying to be more organized this year, especially with school.  One of my goals is to keep up with all my readings and assignments to avoid last-minute stress before exams.  My strategy involves planning my week, using a planner, and trying to stay ahead of my coursework. It's challenging, but the reward of less stress and better grades makes it all worthwhile.","Going to the football game with my boyfriend and his family was energizing.  Being around people I care about and sharing an enjoyable experience, created a fun, relaxed atmosphere.  On the other hand, sometimes large sorority events can leave me feeling drained. I think it comes down to the quality of the interaction and how much energy I have to give.","I try to be agreeable and understanding, even when I disagree.  If I'm in conflict with someone, I try to listen to their perspective before stating my own thoughts and feelings. My priority is to find a solution that works for everyone involved, and to maintain a good relationship.","Leaving home for college was stressful. I was scared of the unknown, and worried about fitting in. Initially, I felt anxious and overwhelmed.

The thrill of the challenge is appealing to me.",I definitely struggle with prioritizing tasks.  My essay shows how many things are swirling in my head at once! I'm aware that I need to get better at managing my time and focusing on what really needs to be done. Setting clear goals and developing better organizational skills are something I need to work on.,"Going cliff jumping with friends this weekend is the kind of social experience that energizes me.  Being with people I enjoy spending time with, sharing excitement and experiences, is really fulfilling.  Conversely, the guy in the hall who is always worried gets on my nerves—I think spending time with people who are constantly anxious drains me.","I generally get along with people, but conflicts can arise. I try to understand their perspective and communicate openly, prioritizing finding a solution that works for everyone.  Even with the guy in the hall, I try to remember my past self to have empathy, even if he's annoying me right now.","I tend to not worry too much.  The essay itself shows a little bit of anxiety about schoolwork and missed opportunities, but I generally have a very positive outlook and focus on the fun things I get to do.  Sometimes I get overwhelmed with my to-do list, but I shake it off and keep moving forward.",y,n,y,y,n

Going to Houston was probably the most ""new"" thing I've done recently, and even that felt more like a necessary trip than an exciting experience.  It was mostly driven by the need to be somewhere else for a while, not a desire for new experiences.  Afterwards, I was mostly relieved to be back in my familiar surroundings.","I'm trying to improve my study habits, especially since I feel I slacked off during my senior year.  Setting goals and achieving them isn’t something I naturally gravitate to, but this time I'm forcing myself to stick to a schedule, making sure I study at night.  It's challenging to overcome my procrastination, but the promise I made to myself and my parents is motivation. I am striving to complete assignments promptly, rather than delaying things until the last minute.","I find large social gatherings draining.  I much prefer the company of a few close friends, like my roommate.  Having her around makes a big difference; otherwise, I’d be terribly bored.  Memorable experiences tend to involve quiet evenings spent with people I feel comfortable with, not large parties or exciting events. My social energy is very limited, and I need plenty of alone time to recharge.","I try to avoid conflict.  The loud music from my next-door neighbor is annoying, but we’re friends, so I just deal with it. I value my friendships more than enforcing my preferences. I'd rather maintain a peaceful relationship than confront the issue directly. I'm generally agreeable and don't like making waves, even when something bothers me.","I get stressed easily.  Being away from my boyfriend makes me anxious, and I tend to worry.  The separation, coupled with studying, and the loud music, adds to my feelings of stress.

It opened me up to exploring more unconventional activities.","Getting my co-op's shopping done efficiently required sustained effort.  I created a detailed list, prioritized items to minimize time spent in each aisle, and stuck to it despite feeling tired and frustrated with the process. While challenging due to its length and monotony, the satisfaction of completing my responsibility successfully was rewarding.","A recent evening out with friends, filled with laughter and lively conversation, was incredibly energizing.  The shared enjoyment and easy flow of interaction left me feeling fulfilled and connected. It reaffirmed my need for social interaction and the positive impact of genuine human connection on my well-being.","I frequently disagree with people, often due to differing perspectives on tasks or ideas. My priority is generally to express my opinions clearly and respectfully, even if that leads to continued debate. My goal is to maintain a functional relationship while still asserting my point of view; I'm not necessarily aiming for consensus.","The four-hour shopping trip for the co-op left me feeling drained and irritable.

While I enjoy familiar things like baseball and music, the thought of trying something new fills me with some apprehension.","I'm actually quite organized and focused when I set my mind to something. The essay shows planning and organization such as making notes on things I can't do in the moment and noting deadlines.  I create schedules and checklists to stay on track, and I break down large goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. When challenges arise, I adjust my approach, but I rarely give up.","I enjoy social interactions, particularly with close friends.  My preference is usually small and comfortable groups or one-on-one interactions.  Large, boisterous gatherings tend to drain me. The essay reveals an interest in and focus on close personal relationships.","I generally try to be agreeable and avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I prefer to find common ground and compromise rather than engage in confrontation. In the essay, I mentioned the need to get along with other people.

I was motivated by a desire to explore a different way of expressing my thoughts and feelings, something less structured and more spontaneous. I found the experience liberating, allowing me to capture the flow of my ideas without self-censorship, although I'm a bit nervous about turning it in as a class assignment.","This semester, I'm determined to get a good grade in this class—I failed it last semester. My strategy is to buy my books early, focus on staying on track with assignments, and manage my work schedule better than I did with my late-night job at Jester. I'm finding it challenging to balance work and school, but I'm motivated by my goal of becoming an elementary school teacher and not wanting to disappoint my parents.","Meeting up with my best friend returning from Sacramento this weekend is definitely an energizing social experience for me. Seeing my friend, connecting, and catching up always boosts my mood and reduces my stress.

However, I imply a conflict between my current ambitions (becoming a teacher) and my past academic performance. I aim to resolve this by committing to better study habits and time management this semester, as I acknowledge that letting myself down by failing last semester has created a conflict. I prioritize personal responsibility and academic success.","I'm feeling nervous about this assignment.  My initial response to this assignment was anxiety, stemming from a lack of experience in this type of academic work and pressure to succeed this semester.

Procrastination is a common issue for me, and I often find myself starting tasks late, leading to rushed work and less than stellar results.  Time management isn't my strong suit, and I prioritize immediate gratification over consistent, long-term planning.

It opened my mind to different ways of thinking about life, purpose, and energy.","I recently set a goal to finally tackle my massive to-read list. To stay on track, I created a schedule, allocating specific times for reading each day. When life got in the way (as it inevitably did!), I adjusted my schedule to compensate, focusing on smaller reading goals. It’s rewarding to make progress on a long-term project and see myself becoming more knowledgeable, even if it is a slow process.  The biggest challenge has been sticking to my planned reading time when other, more immediately appealing, activities pop up.","Spending time with Greg was definitely energizing.

The essay doesn't show direct conflict, but it does reveal worry over my sister taking over my room, highlighting a passive way of handling disagreement. I don't seem to directly confront problems but worry about them internally.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress.  The essay shows this in my worries about schoolwork, loneliness, and the uncertainties of college life.

I set them, but keeping to a schedule just isn't my strong suit.  I usually just wing it and see what happens; if I get behind, oh well.  The party tonight is a bigger priority than studying, even though I know I should probably be catching up on readings.  The most challenging part is the pressure to do well, and the rewarding part is when I manage to cram in just enough to get by.","Going to the party tonight should be fun. I like getting together with my pledge brothers – it's energizing.  I like the feeling of being around people and having a good time, even if I’m a little stressed about my classes. It's the feeling of connection and shared experience that makes it fulfilling.  Quiet time alone is something I need, but it usually comes after social events like this.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I mostly just go along with them to avoid any issues.  My priority is keeping things easy and maintaining good relationships, even if it means compromising my own opinions. If someone is interrupting me, like they have been all afternoon, I find it annoying, but I don't have the energy to do anything about it.","I get stressed easily.  When I'm overwhelmed – like when I’m thinking about my classes and all the reading that I need to do - I tend to just avoid dealing with it and focus on other things instead.  Getting drunk at the party tonight might be a form of procrastination.  I'll deal with it later, I tell myself, but later never really comes.",n,n,n,n,n
793,"I’m not one for trying new things.  The essay shows I stick to what I know, even if it means discomfort.  Novel experiences don’t particularly appeal to me; I prefer familiarity and routine.  In fact, the whole ""club"" situation sounds awful; I’d rather avoid such things.",I struggle with long-term goals. The essay shows my chaotic thoughts and lack of planning. I don't manage time or resources effectively. Procrastination and disorganization are evident; completing tasks consistently is a challenge. I'm overwhelmed easily by demands and my anxieties get in the way of my success.,"Social situations can either energize or drain me, depending on the people involved. The essay hints at my preference for intimate relationships (Monica) versus larger, more demanding groups. With people like Loni and Jennifer, I get exhausted quickly. Being around people I’m comfortable with is key.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me, but I don't usually confront conflicts directly. My response is usually passive, as illustrated in the essay – I resent others taking charge but do not assert myself.  I tend to internalize frustrations rather than directly addressing conflict.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions, as evidenced by the essay's many expressions of worry, dissatisfaction, and frustration. My initial response is often avoidance, or internalizing my feelings. However, I do attempt to manage these feelings by distracting myself with food, or ruminating on things I can control (such as schoolwork or my life expectancy).",n,n,y,n,y
794,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  My focus has been on achieving my goals, like getting a motorcycle to make my commute easier and more enjoyable. While that's a new *possession* for me, it isn't a radical departure from my usual preferences.  The appeal lies in its practicality and the improved convenience it would provide.","I'm not naturally focused on long-term goals, but achieving my academic goals and financial success is something I am focused on.  My strategy involves identifying opportunities to earn money, like internships and summer jobs, to fund my future aspirations. This is more opportunistic than diligently planned. The rewarding part is the potential for financial independence and the freedom to buy what I want in the future.","I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions to large social gatherings.  A memorable social experience was easily studying with a couple of close friends, because it was focused and productive with a small group of people I already know.  Large, boisterous events tend to drain my energy.","I tend to be direct and focused on my own objectives, and this may sometimes seem disagreeable. If I disagree with someone, I'll clearly state my opinion and expectations, but I don't aggressively pursue conflict resolution. My priority is to get what I need done efficiently.","I'm generally not stressed or anxious.  When challenges arise, such as academic pressure, I tend to focus on the solutions and practical steps to overcome them. I work hard to mitigate the issue, and I am not typically one to dwell on things.",y,n,n,n,n
795,"I haven't had many opportunities to try completely new things lately.  My days are mostly filled with classes, studying, and trying to navigate campus. I did go to the learning skills center, which was new to me, and it was helpful, but not exactly exciting or adventurous. I'm more focused on the practical things right now.","I'm trying to stay on top of my schoolwork, which requires a lot of planning and organization.  I make to-do lists and try to schedule specific times for studying. It's challenging because there are so many things to keep track of in college, and sometimes I feel overwhelmed.  Seeing progress in my studies is rewarding, though.","Spending time with Lucy was a memorable social experience.  It was energizing, and surprisingly easy. We connected quickly, even though she was new to me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions rather than large gatherings, and this solidified that preference.","I generally try to be agreeable, but the broken stamp machine really annoyed me. I didn't complain directly to anyone about it, but I felt frustrated that I didn't get to choose the stamps I wanted. I prioritized getting the stamps, but the experience left me feeling a bit negative.","My anxiety often comes out when I’m alone. Today, being alone brought on feelings of loneliness and isolation. I was scared walking back to my dorm late at night,  which made me feel insecure and afraid. I dealt with these feelings by writing it all out.",n,y,n,y,y
796,"I decided to try out for the college debate team, even though I’m usually pretty quiet and reserved.  It felt like a huge leap outside my comfort zone, but the idea of learning to articulate my thoughts more effectively and meeting new people was compelling.  Afterwards, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the experience, even if I wasn't the best at it initially. It definitely pushed me to think differently and approach new challenges.","My main goal is to succeed academically, and that’s meant creating a strict study schedule.  I prioritize my classes based on their difficulty and allocate specific times for each subject, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.  Staying on track has been tough because I have a tendency to procrastinate, but I find that rewarding myself after completing each section motivates me and helps me stay committed. The challenge is juggling everything while keeping up with my workout routine, but my progress feels worth it.","A really draining experience was a large group project in my freshman year, mainly because of some of the members' lack of contribution and poor communication.  It felt like I was carrying the weight of the entire project and it left me feeling utterly depleted.  That experience showed me that my energy levels are much better suited to smaller, more focused collaborations where there is clear communication and shared work ethic.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation, which has caused some issues in group work where a teammate wasn't contributing their fair share. My priority was the project's success, so I chose to have an indirect conversation with them privately about what they need to improve. I find it easier to voice concerns through tactful and non-confrontational methods.","When I started college, the uncertainty of it all overwhelmed me—academics, finances, social life. My initial response was avoidance. I retreated to sleeping to avoid dealing with the stress.  To manage my anxiety, I created a very strict schedule and started exercising. Sticking to a routine helped regain a sense of control.",y,y,y,n,y
797,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences since starting college. My initial idea for a giant, air-conditioned university building was a pretty out-there thought, stemming from discomfort with the Texas heat and a naive expectation of college life.  After experiencing the actual campus, that idea seems less important now.  I'm focusing more on adapting to my current situation.","I set a goal to succeed in my engineering classes, knowing it would require consistent effort. I try to manage my time by using the fraternity's designated study time and attending supplemental instruction.  However, I struggle to stay on track sometimes.  The overwhelming workload, especially in math, presents a challenge.  The reward would be to successfully complete my degree, but I’m feeling a lack of that reward right now.","Being in a fraternity provides lots of social interaction.  While I enjoy the camaraderie and sense of belonging, the constant activities often leave me feeling drained. I value my friendships, but I also need dedicated time for myself to study and de-stress to avoid burnout.  I’m learning that balancing my social life with my academic responsibilities is key.","I haven't had any major disagreements with anyone yet, at least not ones that haven’t been resolved easily.  My main frustration is with the teaching style of my math professor.  While I haven’t confronted him directly, my priority is to understand the material, and I’m trying to do so through supplemental instruction and other resources.","The difficulty of my engineering classes, especially the math, triggers significant anxiety. I initially respond with frustration and a feeling of being overwhelmed. To manage this, I rely on supplemental instruction and study groups to help me grasp the concepts.  I hope to find strategies that work better to lower my anxiety in the long term.",n,y,y,y,n
798,"I guess the most ""open"" thing I've done recently was moving to Austin.  Everyone said it was such a cool city, and I bought into the hype.  I was motivated by the promise of a new adventure, but honestly, I miss Houston a lot.  The experience hasn't been what I expected, and I'm finding it harder to meet people here than I thought.","I'm not really a planner.  I tend to do the bare minimum, which is why I'm writing this at the last minute.  My goals are pretty vague, and I often procrastinate.  I don't have any specific strategies for staying on track, and it's pretty challenging to get things done.  I get overwhelmed easily, so keeping up with anything long-term is difficult.",Social situations can be exhausting. I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with close friends like Cat. Large gatherings leave me drained.  I think it's because I find small talk tedious and prefer deeper conversations.  I need plenty of downtime to recharge after socializing.  It's made me realize I'm more introverted than I thought.,"I don't always handle disagreements well.  I tend to avoid conflict, and if I'm forced to address it, I often just go along with what the other person wants, even if I don't agree.  It's easier to avoid the confrontation, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.  My priority is keeping the peace, even if it means compromising my own beliefs.","I've been having really messed-up dreams lately. One involved almost dying and another had a lamb being killed. Those really freaked me out.  I usually cope by distracting myself, though sometimes I just feel overwhelmed and tired.  I don't usually deal with stress in a healthy way, but I try my best.",y,n,n,n,y
799,"I'm always drawn to exploring new ideas, even if it's just revisiting a favorite book like *Heart of Darkness* for the fifth time.  The depth of Conrad's writing and the different interpretations always fascinate me. It helps me think critically, and afterward, I feel a sense of intellectual satisfaction and a renewed perspective. This is a better way to spend my time than obsessing over minor daily inconveniences.","Balancing my studies and daily life is a constant challenge. I aim for efficiency; for example, I always try to buy the cheapest groceries, even using a push basket for the first time yesterday because of the sheer amount of products. Sometimes I struggle to manage my time perfectly, like when I almost missed Spanish class this morning because I didn't properly lock my bike. Learning from those small mistakes keeps me on track.  The sense of accomplishment from getting everything done, even in a slightly imperfect way, is rewarding.","Energetic social interactions tend to leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  I enjoy conversations that go into depth; discussing Conrad or Shakespeare over drinks, for example.  Superficial discussions or interactions with people who don't share my intellectual curiosity leave me feeling tired. This has taught me that I need quality over quantity in my social interactions.","I tend to internalize disagreements rather than confronting them directly.  While I may strongly believe something (for instance, my interpretation of *Heart of Darkness*), I generally won't push my viewpoints aggressively. I'd rather understand the other person's perspective and find common ground, even if it means compromising a little on less significant matters.  It's more important to me to maintain a peaceful atmosphere and to avoid unnecessary conflict.","When I feel stressed or anxious, like when I'm worried about my bike, my initial reaction is to overthink the situation. My anxieties are small but are frequent, so I make an attempt to resolve them as quickly as possible, like riding my bike home instead of taking public transportation.  Taking deep breaths and acknowledging my worries helps me to calm down and approach the issue rationally rather than letting my feelings overwhelm me.",y,y,y,y,n

Getting prescription goggles for basketball was a recent example—I'd never considered that before, but when I saw them at EyeMasters, it felt like a useful upgrade to my game. It was mostly practical, not a huge leap outside my comfort zone, but I'm glad I did it.","I’m trying to be more organized this year since college is a new level of responsibility. While I did well without studying a lot in high school, I know that's not going to work in college.  I plan to study every day and save the fun for weekends.  It's about finding a balance to avoid making the mistakes I’ve seen others make.","Meeting Diana again at EyeMasters was a nice, low-key social interaction.  I didn't have a lot of time to chat, but seeing a familiar friendly face was energizing. It's not like a huge party, but small interactions like that give me the social boost I need without being overwhelming.","I try to be understanding, even when someone disagrees with me.  For example, Neeraj fixing my computer caused it to stop working temporarily. I could have gotten mad, but I figured it was an accident and more information was needed before judging. He clearly didn't intend to mess it up.","When my computer crashed, I initially felt frustrated and stressed. I didn't panic, though. I took a deep breath and systematically figured out the situation, getting help from Neeraj when needed. The situation is now fixed.",y,y,y,y,n

I suppose moving here itself was new, but it wasn't a conscious choice to try something different; it was more of a leap of faith, and honestly, right now I'm questioning whether it was the right choice.","Keeping up with my classwork has been my primary goal since moving. I've managed my time by having a set study schedule each night.  This is easier because, unfortunately, I don't have many distractions from friends; it's been a lonely experience.  This consistent routine has been rewarding in that it gives me a sense of control amidst all the other uncertainty, though it's also somewhat isolating.","A memorable social experience?  That's difficult.  Since moving, my social interactions have been minimal.  I have a few acquaintances but haven't made any close friends.  This lack of connection leaves me feeling drained and lonely.  It's reinforced my understanding that I need close, supportive relationships and that being surrounded by people isn't enough if those relationships aren't meaningful.","I haven't had major disagreements since moving, which is partially due to my limited social interactions. However, I tend to avoid conflict, which is probably something I need to work on.  My priority in any disagreement is to find a way to maintain the relationship, even if it means compromising my own needs.  I struggle with asserting myself, which makes me feel like I often end up giving in to others' wishes.","Moving to Austin has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was overwhelming loneliness and self-doubt.  I've tried to manage my emotions by sticking to my study schedule and avoiding social situations which only increases my feelings of isolation. I've also been journaling (this is kind of like journaling, right?)  to process my feelings, but honestly, it hasn't been particularly helpful.",n,y,n,n,y
802,"I've always been drawn to exploring new ideas and perspectives.  Reading the textbook for my psychology class, which I'm getting ahead in, has been a fascinating experience, especially the sections on the brain and how it affects our emotions and thoughts. It's given me new ways of understanding my own feelings and experiences, confirming some intuitions I've had, and has motivated me to continue learning about the mind-body connection. This process feels inherently rewarding.","Setting and achieving goals isn't always my strong suit, but I'm working on it.  Quitting weed and alcohol was a major goal that required significant self-discipline and consistent effort.  While I haven't always been successful at staying on track with other goals, I'm proud of this one and I approach other endeavors with a similar sense of resolve, although I'm not perfect. The rewarding aspect is the personal growth and self-improvement that comes with overcoming challenges.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  I much prefer one-on-one conversations or being with a few close friends. This experience has taught me that I need quiet time to recharge, and that my energy is best spent on nurturing deeper relationships rather than large social functions.","Disagreements are inevitable, especially in close relationships.  My relationship with my girlfriend has definitely had its share of disagreements. In these situations, my priority is open and honest communication, even if it's difficult. While I sometimes struggle to express my feelings effectively,  my goal is always to find a resolution that respects both of our perspectives, even if it requires compromise from both of us.  I try to approach things with an understanding that both of our feelings are valid.","I deal with anxiety and stress in different ways. I tend to internalize my feelings, and my initial response is often to isolate myself.

I'm not meticulously organized, but I'm aware of the need to stay on task. I primarily rely on self-discipline and motivation to meet deadlines, though my methods could be more efficient.  The challenges lie in balancing my studies with my desire for spontaneity, and the rewards are the sense of accomplishment when I successfully complete assignments.","Spending time alone in my apartment is my preferred way to recharge. Social interactions, even with loved ones, can be draining.  I value close connections with family but find large social gatherings overwhelming and exhausting.  My social preferences lean towards quiet solitude and meaningful interactions with a select few, rather than boisterous socializing.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.  My priority is maintaining peace and harmony, even if it means compromising my own opinions.  I don't enjoy confrontation and prefer to focus on finding common ground, or simply withdrawing from the disagreement to preserve the relationship.","The uncertainty about the future, specifically the transition to a career and the potential for a monotonous routine, causes me considerable anxiety.

Deadlines often catch me off guard, and I tend to procrastinate until the last minute before focusing on tasks – it's a habit I'm trying to break.  While this can be stressful, the rush of adrenaline sometimes helps me produce creative results.","Large social gatherings, like that frat party, can be overwhelming for me.  While I enjoy the energy of some social interactions, they often leave me feeling drained and needing significant alone time to recharge.  I’m definitely more of an introvert who needs a balance of social engagement and solitude.","Disagreements aren't always easy. When I disagreed with the way my ex-boyfriend was treating me (and his interactions with other people), it led to a painful break-up. My priority was to assert my own needs and boundaries, even if it meant causing conflict, which I find difficult but necessary in certain situations.","I tend to overthink things.  The email mix-up with my ex's similar-named contact caused a lot of stress and anxiety.  I initially spiraled into worry, but managed to take action by writing an email to clear things up.

Well, it was definitely fun, but I still mostly prefer familiar routines.","I'm not the most organized person, to be honest.  The speech assignment tomorrow is a perfect example – I'm procrastinating a little, prioritizing socializing with my friends tonight instead. My time management is…flexible. I usually get things done eventually, even if it's not in the most efficient way.  I find the pressure stressful but also kind of motivating—a deadline really focuses me.","Going out to dinner with my pledge class tonight—that's the kind of social experience I enjoy.

Quiet nights alone would drain me; I am quite extroverted.","I try to be agreeable. I don’t like conflict, and I find that most issues can be resolved just by talking things through and compromising. I prioritize maintaining good relationships above being completely right in a disagreement—I'm not going to rock the boat just for the sake of it.","I generally don’t get too stressed.  Even with the upcoming speech and chemistry to study, I'm not overly worried.

Right now, I'm struggling to balance my social life with academics.  To tackle my overwhelming reading assignment, I'm planning an all-nighter, which isn't ideal but reflects my commitment to meeting obligations, even if it means sacrificing sleep and other activities.

When I set a goal, like finishing a project, I tend to work in spurts of intense focus, followed by periods of procrastination.  While this is inefficient, it works for me.

I don't tend to engage in protracted arguments.","I don't generally get stressed, which probably comes from my generally agreeable nature.

The positive impact I had on them motivated me to continue and definitely broadened my perspective.","I’m not the most organized person.

When I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid direct conflict. It’s easier to just go along with things, even if I don't agree. It's just not worth the potential friction or disruption. My focus is avoiding discomfort.","Feeling stressed and anxious is a common experience for me lately. My immediate reaction is often to withdraw and ruminate on my problems. I tend to overthink things and obsess over negative feelings. I find it really hard to take action, but I do try to distract myself to feel better.",n,n,n,n,y
812,"I'm pretty open to trying new things, even if it means stepping outside of my comfort zone.  Adding that cultural anthropology class was a spontaneous decision, but the description sounded interesting enough to give it a shot. I'm hoping it will be a good fit for me and help me expand my horizons, even if I'm a bit behind. I don’t mind the occasional unplanned change of plans.","I definitely struggle with following through on tasks.  My essay shows this clearly; I intended to do a lot of things today but barely accomplished anything. While I set goals like getting my parking permit or returning my physics books, I lack the consistent drive to tackle them right away.  Procrastination is a major obstacle.","I enjoy social interactions with people I connect with, but it's clear I prefer comfortable, low-pressure situations. My current job at Sunglass Outfitters sounds really fun and provides this low-pressure environment, filled with friendly co-workers. I value these relationships. The interview that fell through was discouraging, highlighting my need for predictability and reassurance in social situations.","I generally try to be agreeable and avoid conflict.  While my essay doesn't directly address a specific disagreement, my overall tone suggests a preference for maintaining harmony.  I am adaptable and can make accommodations to avoid stressful encounters, even if it means sacrificing some personal preferences.","I tend to get overwhelmed easily and experience significant stress when things don't go as planned. The lack of progress on my to-do list is a source of anxiety. While I try to stay positive (""everything will be okay""), I am clearly affected by setbacks and failures, and my emotional response involves immediate self-criticism and avoidance, as demonstrated by my inaction.",y,n,y,y,n
813,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  Going to Oat Willies was pretty much out of my comfort zone, but my friend dragged me along. It wasn't terrible, but I don't feel any urge to go back. It was just… okay. I guess I was curious, but that's about it.",I don't really set goals.  Things just sort of happen.  I wouldn't say I'm particularly organized or driven. The fact that I'm even writing this is probably unusual for me.,"Shopping with my friend was… tolerable.  I'm not really a people person.  Too much interaction makes me feel drained. Running into someone from high school was fine, but I didn't really feel energized by it.","The situation with the vintage store guy was annoying.  I didn't really confront him or make a big deal about it.  It's not worth the effort to argue, even when someone's accusing me wrongly. I'd rather just move on.",Being wrongly accused of stealing was a little stressful.  Mostly I just shrugged it off. I don't dwell on things like that.  It didn't really bother me that much.,n,n,n,n,y
814,"I recently decided to attend a Greek festival, even though I felt like an outsider as a non-Greek.  The motivation was to step outside my comfort zone and experience something new culturally.  Despite initial anxieties, I found it surprisingly enriching and enjoyed aspects of the experience, but still felt quite out of place.","I'm trying to quit a drug, and it's a huge challenge requiring consistent effort and planning.  I've tried setting daily goals, seeking support from others (including God), and using prayer to stay on track, and journaling to track my progress.  The most challenging aspect is overcoming my weakness and urges; the most rewarding is the sense of progress, even with setbacks.","Meeting Elise in this new environment was both energizing and draining. The energizing part came from the connection we share, but it's also been stressful because of the competitive feelings. This experience confirmed my need for authentic connections and highlighted my sensitivity to potentially stressful social dynamics.","My relationship with Elise involves navigating feelings of competition and threat. I've tried to communicate openly and honestly about my feelings, prioritizing mutual understanding and empathy. While it's been difficult, I'm trying to focus on support and mutual respect, despite feeling insecure.","Feeling like an outsider at the Greek festival, and generally feeling ""off balance"" in my new surroundings in Texas, triggered feelings of anxiety. I responded by praying and turning to my faith, seeking spiritual strength and comfort. Writing in my journal helps me process these feelings and focus on what I can control.",y,y,y,y,n
815,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous, but I did try wearing black jeans on a hot sunny day.  It wasn't a conscious choice for an experience, more a lack of planning. The experience taught me to pay more attention to weather conditions when choosing clothing. I don't really regret it, but it wasn't optimal.","I wouldn't say I'm very organized. My CS homework was a goal that required effort, but I wasn't great at time management. I mostly relied on asking for help from friends (Eric, Kevin) when I struggled, rather than a structured plan.  The lack of a plan was challenging, but getting the help I needed was rewarding.","Meeting people at work was a somewhat neutral experience. A brief conversation with Kevin was pleasant enough, but I didn't feel particularly energized or drained.  It seems I prefer smaller interactions rather than large social gatherings which made it a quiet interaction.","I tend to keep to myself and avoid conflict. My priorities are to make things as simple as possible. I don't engage in much conflict or direct confrontation, choosing instead to let things simply be.","The crickets chirping in my room really stressed me out. My initial reaction was irritation, and I even considered violence towards them. It seems odd now. I managed the situation by getting someone to address the problem. My frustration subsided afterward.",y,n,n,n,n
816,"I’ve always been drawn to new experiences, even if they push me outside my comfort zone.  Last year, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I was initially motivated by a desire to do something creative, something different from my usual routine, and it turned out to be surprisingly relaxing and rewarding. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment and discovered a newfound appreciation for working with my hands.","While I struggle with procrastination, I've had some success with projects requiring sustained effort.  For my Literature and Law paper, I broke the task into smaller, manageable chunks, setting deadlines for each section.  I used a timer to focus on the task at hand, minimizing distractions like TV.  Staying committed was difficult—I often felt overwhelmed—but the feeling of accomplishment after completing each segment kept me going.  It highlighted both my struggles with focus and my ability to push through when I find a system that works.","A memorable social experience was a lively dinner party with close friends.  The energy of the group, the shared laughter, and the engaging conversations invigorated me.  However, large, unfamiliar gatherings often leave me feeling drained. This experience solidified my preference for intimate settings with people I know well, where genuine connection and meaningful conversations are prioritized over the noise and bustle of a bigger crowd.  I value quality over quantity in social interactions.","I recently had a disagreement with a friend about a shared project.  My priority was to understand their perspective and find a mutually agreeable solution, rather than focusing on being ""right.""  I actively listened to their concerns, explained my viewpoint calmly, and we ultimately compromised, finding a compromise that worked for both of us.  Maintaining the friendship was more important to me than winning the argument.","I frequently feel stressed and anxious, especially when facing deadlines or overwhelmed by tasks.  My initial response is often procrastination, but I’m trying to develop healthier coping mechanisms.  I’ve started practicing mindfulness techniques, trying to focus on the present moment.  Acknowledging my anxiety rather than ignoring it, helps me approach my tasks more constructively, breaking them down into smaller steps.",y,y,y,y,y
817,"I'm not exactly an adventurous person. While I’d love to try new things and expand my horizons, the thought of stepping outside my comfort zone often feels daunting.  That said, I did try to force myself to socialize more at college to meet people, even though I found it tedious.  Ultimately, the experience left me feeling more drained than fulfilled, confirming my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions.","I'm really not a planner.  I usually wait until the last minute to do things, as evidenced by my procrastination on this essay.  I don't really have any specific strategies to keep myself on task. I do, however, find myself occasionally motivated to complete things ahead of schedule (like this!), which is something I’m trying to become better at. This feeling of being unprepared, though, is definitely a challenge.","Large social gatherings definitely drain me. The essay shows how I find most people boring and tedious. I yearn for deeper connections rather than superficial interactions in loud environments. Spending time with a close friend, however, can leave me feeling energized and content.  I've realized my social needs are best met in one-on-one settings or with small, close-knit groups.","I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. I value honesty, but I don't always feel comfortable expressing my disagreements directly.  This shows in my passive way of dealing with my feelings about college—I complain but don't actively take steps to improve my situation. I prioritize maintaining peaceful relationships, even if it means sacrificing my own comfort.","When stressed, I tend to get restless and easily frustrated. My computer freezing is a perfect example. I cope by venting my feelings, often in a somewhat disorganized and repetitive manner, as seen in this essay.  While I don't have specific coping mechanisms, I rely on the support of loved ones (like my cousin) when I'm feeling overwhelmed.",y,n,y,n,n
818,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things; I prefer sticking to what I know and enjoy.  My life is pretty structured around my friends and family, and trying new activities doesn't really appeal to me. The most ""new"" thing I've done recently was going to Cancun for my senior trip, but even that was mainly about spending time with my friends in a familiar setting of fun and relaxation.","I'm not the most organized person, and setting long-term goals isn't really my style. I tend to focus more on enjoying the present moment and things that excite me in the short term.  I don't usually make detailed plans or timetables; I just sort of go with the flow. My life is more guided by spontaneous social connections and events than structured goals.","Seeing my friends and my ex-boyfriend this weekend is exactly the kind of social interaction that energizes me.  Being around people I'm close to, sharing laughs and memories, really makes me feel alive. Conversely, I'd be drained from being at a big party with strangers, but with my close friends, there's just a natural energy and comfort I get.","I tend to avoid conflict as much as possible, even if I disagree with someone. Usually, if I don't agree, I'll just quietly let it go unless it becomes directly impactful on my friends. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships and avoiding upsetting anyone, even if it means compromising my own point of view. My friends are very important to me, so keeping those friendships happy is more important than righting a wrong.","I can get pretty stressed and anxious, especially when I'm worried about things not going the way I want, or if I'm concerned about the feelings of others. My initial response is usually to worry or overthink things, so I have to actively try and stop that from taking control. I usually try to distract myself with something fun or comforting until the anxiety subsides.  Spending time with my close friends is a helpful way to manage my emotions; they always know how to cheer me up.",n,n,y,y,y
819,"I recently decided to try stand-up comedy. I’d always enjoyed making people laugh, and figured it would be a fun challenge.  It turned out to be terrifying, but surprisingly exhilarating. Afterwards, I felt a profound sense of accomplishment, despite bombing on stage.","Balancing school and my social life has been a constant juggling act. I try to create schedules and prioritize tasks, but often fall behind.  While I strive for organization, procrastination often gets the better of me.  It’s both challenging and rewarding; the satisfaction of completing an assignment outweighs the stress of leaving it to the last minute.","Last night's reunion with my friends in San Antonio was incredibly energizing. The shared laughter, inside jokes, and easy camaraderie recharged me.  Being surrounded by people who understand me and accept me is incredibly fulfilling and reinforces my need for strong social connections.","I’ve had disagreements with friends about political issues, but I try to listen to their perspectives.  My priority is maintaining the friendship, even if we don’t agree on everything.  Open communication and finding common ground are usually successful in resolving conflicts.","My biggest fear is losing touch with my friends.  Initially, this fear manifests as anxiety and a sense of impending doom, but I counteract it by reminding myself that staying connected is easier than ever in our modern world. Focusing on maintaining contact alleviates much of the worry.",y,n,y,y,n
820,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, even if it makes me a little nervous.  Recently, I started learning astronomy, which is completely outside my usual comfort zone.  The sheer vastness of space and the complexity of the subject matter really fascinate me.  While it's challenging, the sense of discovery keeps me engaged.","I tend to struggle with setting and meeting long-term goals.  My astronomy homework is a good example.  I often find myself procrastinating, and it's only when the deadline looms that I finally buckle down.  I don't have great time-management skills, but I do prioritize what's most immediately pressing.  It's rewarding when I finish an assignment like that, but the process is almost always stressful.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining for me. A close, intimate conversation with someone I deeply connect with, like my friend Heather, leaves me feeling happy and fulfilled. But spending time in large groups or with people I don't know very well can quickly leave me exhausted and needing time alone to recharge.  I'm learning to be more selective about my social engagements and to prioritize quality over quantity.","I often avoid confrontation, but this essay showcases how I'm grappling with difficult interpersonal issues.  My approach to disagreements is typically to try and understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't entirely agree with them.  Ultimately, honesty and open communication are what matter most to me, even if it causes temporary discomfort.","I tend to overthink things, especially regarding my relationships. My anxiety often manifests as worry and indecisiveness, like in my current situation with Joanna and Heather.  When I feel overwhelmed, I try to talk to someone I trust or distract myself by focusing on something else, like my studies. Although not always effective, these techniques help me regain perspective.",y,n,n,y,y
821,"I haven't really tried anything completely new lately.  My focus has been entirely on navigating college, which feels overwhelming enough. The thought of adding something else feels impossible right now.  Maybe later, when things are less chaotic.","I set a goal of getting a 4.0 GPA, which is definitely a challenge for me, considering I've never really studied before. My time management is terrible; I skip classes and spend too much time thinking about cars or comics.  I’m not sure what strategies would work, although I know I need to try. The idea of achieving it is rewarding, but the actual work seems impossible.","Being around my friends playing ball or shooting pool is definitely energizing.  It's a welcome break from the stress of college. On the other hand, interacting with professors or strangers makes me feel drained and anxious; I avoid it whenever possible.  I prefer smaller, closer social groups, clearly.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid them entirely, which isn't the best approach. Sometimes I agree to things even if I don't agree with them just to avoid conflict. My priority is maintaining peace and avoiding confrontation, even if it means compromising my own views.","College is incredibly stressful. My initial response is usually avoidance—skipping classes, procrastinating, and generally avoiding the work that stresses me out. Eventually I have an overwhelming anxiety attack and then I start to think of constructive approaches, but the cycle repeats itself. I often find myself worrying about failing and not achieving my goals.",n,n,y,y,n
822,"I haven't really had many experiences that pushed me outside my comfort zone, to be honest.  Most things feel familiar, and I tend to stick to what I know.  The thought of trying something completely new fills me with anxiety, so I generally avoid it.","Goals?  I start them with great enthusiasm, but maintaining consistent effort is a huge struggle. I make plans, even detailed ones sometimes, but often lose steam quickly. Staying on track is incredibly difficult, and I usually end up giving up before reaching the finish line.","Large social gatherings are draining. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  Being around a lot of people leaves me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, and I usually retreat to recharge afterward.","Disagreements are tough for me, I tend to avoid direct conflict. In disagreements, my priority is to maintain harmony, often at the expense of expressing my own opinion fully. I’ll usually try to find common ground or simply agree to disagree to avoid upsetting the other person.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  My initial reaction is often to withdraw and ruminate on things.  Managing my emotions is an ongoing challenge, but I sometimes find comfort in talking to trusted friends or engaging in calming activities, like going to church.",n,n,n,y,y
823,"I've always been curious about different cultures, so last summer I decided to take a solo backpacking trip across Southeast Asia.  The motivation was a desire to step outside my comfort zone and broaden my perspective. I loved experiencing the diverse food, landscapes, and people, even though there were a few challenging moments.  It was incredibly rewarding and helped me grow as a person.","My goal was to finish my master's thesis on time and under budget. I created a detailed timeline with milestones, using a project management app to track my progress.  I broke down the tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. While there were setbacks, my structured approach and regular self-check-ins kept me focused, and the sense of accomplishment upon completion was incredibly gratifying.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I remember attending a huge party once, and even though I knew people there, the noise, crowds, and constant interaction left me feeling exhausted.  I realized I recharge better in smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. This experience highlighted the importance of introspective time and mindful engagement in social activities.","There was a disagreement with a project partner about our thesis structure. To resolve this, we sat down and discussed each other's perspectives calmly. My priority was finding a solution that satisfied both of us, compromising on certain elements to reach a consensus that felt fair to both sides.  Collaboration and mutual respect were key in this instance.","Recently, I felt overwhelmed with coursework. My initial reaction was panic, but I took a deep breath and addressed my anxiety through physical activity – going for a walk. I found this helped clear my head and allowed me to approach my work with a calmer, more focused mindset. Focusing on my breathing and breaking down tasks into more smaller units also alleviated my stress.",y,y,n,y,n
824,"I wrote a song for my Madrigal Dinner audition.  It was completely out of my comfort zone, but the idea just came to me and I felt compelled to try it.  It felt surprisingly liberating to share something so personal, even if the outcome is uncertain.","Balancing college, a relationship, and my audition was challenging. I didn't really plan things out or manage my time strategically. I just tried to do my best with what I had, which proved difficult.  I wish I had been more organised.","The audition itself was energizing; performing my own song and getting positive feedback was thrilling.  However, the breakup left me feeling completely drained, because I value close connections with others.  It made me realize how important having supportive relationships are to me.","My breakup was difficult because I truly cared for his parents, even though the relationship wasn't healthy.  I prioritized honesty and my own well-being over trying to please everyone. While I feel bad about letting them down, I know I made the right decision.",The breakup and the audition made me very anxious and stressed.  My initial response was to write everything down.

Casey, my fiancé, encouraged me to try it, and the thrill of something so different, combined with the romantic aspect of sharing the experience with him, motivated me to give it a shot. Afterward, I felt exhilarated and empowered; it was a fantastic experience that pushed me outside my comfort zone.","I set a goal to excel in my math major, even though I'm unsure about my career path.  To stay on track, I've tried to balance my studies with my social life and other hobbies. Although I sometimes feel overwhelmed and procrastinate, I use strategies like breaking down large tasks and setting smaller, more achievable goals to keep myself motivated. The challenge has been balancing my desire for exploration with the pressures of academic success, but the reward is the personal growth I experience through perseverance.","Spending time with Casey is always energizing; his intelligence and love make me feel comfortable and happy.  In contrast, being around people who constantly talk about computers and things I don’t understand leaves me drained and feeling isolated. This has taught me that quality time with people I truly connect with is far more valuable than large social gatherings.","When Doug and Casey make fun of my Louisiana accent, I usually try to laugh it off, but sometimes it hurts my feelings.  My priority in these situations is to maintain a positive relationship; I want them to know I’m not offended, while also hoping they'll be more sensitive in the future. I prioritize maintaining relationships over always winning an argument.","This week I'm feeling anxious about my classes and adjusting to college life.  My initial response is to worry excessively, which then leads to procrastination.  To manage this, I try to focus on the positive aspects of my new environment, break down my tasks into smaller parts, and engage in activities I enjoy, like listening to music and playing games.

While I did climb a volcano in Mexico and try horseback riding, those were part of a larger, exciting vacation fueled by escaping reality.  Generally, I prefer familiar routines and activities. New things feel daunting and often make me anxious,  which is why I'm finding school so challenging right now.","I'm definitely not the most organized person. Although I know I *should* be studying and working out more, I often get sidetracked by socializing or other immediate pleasures. I rarely plan ahead, preferring to deal with things as they come.  My time management skills are... lacking, to say the least. This is probably why I'm worried about schoolwork, but I also know that I can pull it together when I absolutely have to.","I love socializing and meeting new people! My trip to Mexico was amazing partly because of the friends I made. I thrive in lively social situations and get energized by interactions with others. However, even fun social events can leave me feeling depleted if they're too intense or involve too much drama.  I need alone time to recharge after periods of high social activity. I crave connection.","I'm not very good at conflict. I tend to avoid disagreements and put my own needs aside to maintain harmony, at least on the surface. I don't confront those I disagree with in any substantial way, but this causes my own inner conflict that I find difficult to manage.  It might be why I'm finding school so hard; I'm not comfortable speaking up when I have a problem with the way the classes are being run.","I'm definitely a high-strung person.  I worry constantly about everything – school, relationships, my future, even things that are completely out of my control.  The start of the school year always makes me extremely anxious. I handle stress by trying to avoid things that cause me to feel this way, and occasionally by distracting myself with friends or other activities.  My anxiety is almost constant, and it makes it hard to fully enjoy life.",n,y,y,n,y

I don't remember the last time I actually tried something *new*.","I set a goal to write these thank-you notes to my grandparents, but that's only because they keep sending me money.  I’m terrible at managing my time.  I procrastinate a lot, and rarely stick to a schedule, unless it involves getting a slurpee. My motivation?  Money. That’s it.  Anything else is more trouble than it's worth.","Going to concerts with friends used to energize me, but lately, it just feels draining. Maybe I'm getting too old, or maybe I just need to pick my social events more carefully. The noisy crowds and long lines are more trouble than the actual concert, which is disappointing, because the music is usually good.  I need my quiet time now more than ever.","I avoid conflict as much as possible. If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet, or change the subject.  It's easier to agree than disagree, even if it's just to myself. My priority is to avoid any confrontation, even if that means not getting what I want.","When I'm stressed or anxious, I tend to get really scattered and just do a lot of little things to fill the time, like cleaning up my room (sort of) or watching TV, then I just forget about it until the next big thing happens.

I'm more interested in delving deeper into things I already enjoy, like learning to play the drums—a melodic style, not the loud, fast stuff—or perhaps picking up the guitar.  Trying something completely new isn't really a priority for me.","I'm definitely not known for my organizational skills. My essay shows that,  I procrastinate a lot, which is a big problem. I put off assignments and tend to make impulsive purchases—buying things conveniently rather than getting the best deal. Although I’ve been better at tracking my finances lately to buy a new computer, this is largely due to external pressures rather than innate self-discipline.  I need to improve my time management and budgeting skills.","I'm not exactly a social butterfly.  Large, boisterous social gatherings probably wouldn't energize me; they'd more likely drain me. My ideal social interaction involves a small group of close friends or enjoying quiet time with my roommate, though sometimes I wonder if I annoy him with my constant music.  I prefer deeper connections to large groups.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll probably try to find a way to agree to disagree. My priority is to maintain harmonious relationships, even if it means compromising my own views. I'm not big on confrontation.","I don't generally feel overly stressed or anxious, but the prospect of managing my finances and taxes does worry me.

My dreams of becoming a ""hero"" are less a structured plan and more a vague aspiration. However, my desire to master Taekwondo has shown some small success - although I often get distracted or lose focus. I find the process both challenging and rewarding, as consistent effort is needed to improve form and technique, although I often struggle to maintain this.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.

Large groups feel overwhelming, while one-on-one interactions allow me to connect more deeply with someone and understand their perspective. I avoid situations that feel too demanding.","I find myself easily frustrated with arrogance and intellectual dishonesty, like I experienced with that teacher who wouldn't admit they could be wrong. While I believe in expressing my disagreements, I prefer to avoid open confrontation.  My priority is clear communication, but I find it challenging to engage in difficult conversations. I don’t enjoy conflicts and mostly prefer to walk away.","I tend to dwell on things, especially when I feel like I’ve been wronged. I get easily frustrated and angry, as seen in my reaction to the teacher. My initial reaction is often anger, which then gives way to frustration and brooding.

Balancing my desire to explore new aspects of my life in college with my academic pursuits is tough, and sometimes I slip up. But I use that as a learning experience to refine my future approach.","Going out clubbing is usually energizing, although sometimes it leaves me feeling utterly drained. A positive experience involves meeting interesting people and having engaging conversations. If the atmosphere is too overwhelming or I feel like I don't connect with anyone, it can lead to exhaustion. I'm learning that I need a balance of social interaction and alone time to feel my best—some nights, a quiet night in is what I truly crave.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation, but when disagreements arise, I try my best to understand the other person's perspective.  My priority is to resolve conflicts peacefully, even if it means compromising my own views sometimes. I believe in open communication, but also recognize that sometimes I need some alone time to process my thoughts and feelings before responding thoughtfully.","Being so far from home and feeling overwhelmed by the changes in my life has triggered significant anxiety. When this happens, I often withdraw and ruminate, making the situation feel much worse.  To cope, I use music as an emotional outlet and try to engage in activities that calm me.

I usually think logically and analytically, which is reflected in my rather linear thought process,  but I was compelled to try expressing my thoughts in a stream-of-consciousness style to fulfill this assignment.  The experience was oddly freeing, even though it made me acutely aware of my own typing weaknesses. I find it fascinating how this seemingly simple task reveals so much about the way my mind works.","I don't really set goals in the traditional sense. I tend to be more reactive than proactive.  If I find something interesting, I'll pursue it—but I don't usually plan my time or resources to achieve them, and this lack of structure occasionally leads to incomplete projects. I'm not a planner. The reward is the intellectual stimulation of the pursuit, though the lack of tangible results is sometimes frustrating.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, or even solitude.  I value depth over breadth when it comes to relationships. I find that I get really energized by deep discussions with one or two people that delve into complex or thought-provoking issues, but a large gathering, or an event where I'm forced into small talk, can leave me completely exhausted.","I strive to understand others' perspectives, even when they differ sharply from my own. I believe that most disagreements stem from differing perceptions of the same facts. The way I approach these disagreements is by analyzing the underlying beliefs and assumptions, then trying to build a bridge between viewpoints. Even if there is no agreement reached, understanding is still important.","When I feel stressed, my initial reaction is to analyze the situation very carefully in a cool, detached manner.  This helps me to formulate a plan of attack. I don't usually panic, but that doesn't mean I don't feel anxious.

832,"I’m not one for trying new things, honestly.  The essay shows that I’m pretty stuck in my routine and thoughts.  While I did mention wanting to learn how to make music symbols on the computer, that was more of a passing curiosity than a dedicated pursuit. It's more that I wish I could use my Mac; I'm not open to trying new computers.","The essay reveals a distinct lack of planning and organization. My goals, like getting my car serviced, are mentioned as afterthoughts, and there's no evidence of systematic time management or consistent effort toward long-term achievements.  I’m more focused on immediate desires and anxieties than maintaining long-term plans.  This is reflected in my inconsistent and scattered thoughts.","Social interactions seem to be a mixed bag for me. I mention hoping to see someone and wanting a job but also express concern about others' feelings toward me.  Overall, the essay projects a relatively introverted nature, focusing more on my internal thoughts and feelings than extensive social engagement. I seem more comfortable with my own company, rather than wanting to be surrounded by many people.","The essay shows I can have disagreements; my concerns about my relationships and my desire to keep promises point to a sensitivity to others' opinions and feelings. However, my responses seem internally focused more than actively trying to resolve conflict, suggesting less of a focus on pleasing others than on managing my own anxieties about relationships.","My essay is full of worries, anxieties, and self-doubt.  I express concern about others' feelings towards me, fear about job prospects, and general feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. My emotional state fluctuates wildly, and I freely admit to being upset, and questioning the nature of things.  The constant stream-of-consciousness reflects a restless mind easily caught up in worries.",y,n,n,n,y
833,"I decided to watch the MTV Music Awards.  I'd never really watched much cable TV before, so it was a totally new experience for me.  I was motivated by curiosity and a desire for something different from my usual routine.  I enjoyed it more than I expected; it was cool seeing all the music videos and performances.","I set a goal to finish my math homework.  I didn't really have a structured plan; I just kind of started and worked on it until it was done.  I didn't prioritize it too much, and only did it when I felt motivated enough, getting distracted easily.  It was rewarding to finish, but staying focused was a struggle.",Watching the MTV Music Awards with my suite mates was energizing.  The shared experience and the excitement of the show created a fun atmosphere.  It reinforced my preference for low-key social interactions with close friends over large or high-energy gatherings.,"My roommate's music was really loud, but I didn't say anything. I just dealt with it because I didn't want any conflict.  It wasn't that big a deal to me, and I prioritized keeping the peace over expressing my annoyance.","Failing to go to SI today stressed me out. I immediately felt a sense of panic and regret.  To manage it, I just kept writing – this essay helped me process my anxiety.  I also tried to rationalize it by reminding myself that I went last week.",y,n,n,n,y
834,"I've always been fairly adaptable, and starting college was a huge change.  The sheer size of the university, with 50,000 students compared to my high school's 1700, was initially overwhelming.  But I quickly adapted to the larger environment and embraced the new challenges. I found the online aspect of my courses to be a refreshing change and an opportunity to use technology I was already accustomed to.","I'm not the most organized person, as evidenced by my past struggles with losing homework.  While I haven't explicitly set long-term goals, adapting to college life has been an ongoing project, and success in this has required me to improve my time management skills (though not perfectly). I procrastinate and rely on shortcuts (like Cliff's Notes). The reward has been managing my schoolwork and my social life, even if it is a bit messy.","The large size of my college classes initially felt quite intimidating, a significant change from my smaller high school. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  The sheer number of people left me feeling slightly overwhelmed.   I much prefer keeping in touch with my close friends through email and instant messaging.","I haven't explicitly described any major conflicts, but the essay shows a mild avoidance of confrontation.  For instance, my attitude toward those who leave their laundry unattended in the dryer suggests a passive acceptance rather than direct confrontation. I prefer to avoid unnecessary conflict.","While I mention feeling overwhelmed by the large university, my overall tone is fairly relaxed. There's a sense of adaptability and even humor in facing challenges.  I don't explicitly express significant stress or anxiety, suggesting that I generally cope well with new situations.",y,n,n,n,n
835,"I’ve never really been one for trying new things, but I did sign up for this psychology class, which was pretty far outside of my comfort zone.  I guess the motivation was the hope that it would be interesting – maybe even help me understand myself a little better.  Honestly, the experience has been… well, I’m still figuring that out.  It feels overwhelming, stressful, and a bit pointless.","I'm constantly trying to improve my work in all my classes. I spend a lot of time on assignments, trying to perfect them but I still always feel behind and stressed. My time management isn’t great; I tend to get bogged down in details and then get overwhelmed by how much I haven’t done.  I struggle to prioritize; I end up doing things that don't need to be done perfectly, while more important tasks fall behind. The challenge is feeling constantly behind. The reward?  I guess, maybe feeling like I've done my best, but that feeling is rare.",Social situations generally drain me. I’d rather be alone.  This assignment itself feels like a social interaction—an attempt to engage with the expectations and standards of others.  It's exhausting. This makes me even more withdrawn and isolated. I am not sure whether this will change or what I can do about it.,"I often find myself disagreeing with people. I get annoyed that I have to do this assignment, as I think it’s stupid and pointless, and I think many people think it is also stupid and pointless. I'm usually quiet when disagreements arise to avoid conflict.  It’s easier to just go along to get along, even if I don't agree. I would rather not have to spend my time arguing about pointless things with other people who think it is just as pointless and stupid as me.","This whole assignment has been intensely stressful and anxiety-inducing. I’m already feeling overwhelmed by my courses and this adds to it.  My initial response is to procrastinate.  Then I get even more stressed about procrastinating, which leads to further procrastination and stress. I'm not sure what constructive steps I'm taking, if any.  It mostly involves trying to keep busy, even if the tasks are pointless, because that's better than facing how stressed I am.",y,n,n,n,y

My room's a disaster, my phone bill is going to be astronomical, and I'm drowning in schoolwork. I *intend* to study, but somehow things just don't get done.  I'm more focused on the weekend and seeing Erin, which feels more important than anything else right now.","Seeing Erin this weekend is energizing.  Being around my friends is great; the other people here? Not so much. I really need people I feel comfortable with; otherwise, social interactions drain me.  I value a small, close-knit group of friends more than big, crowded parties.","I'm pretty straightforward.  If someone's annoying me, I'll let them know.  People constantly criticize my relationship with Erin, and it makes me mad.  I don't care what they think, my priorities are with her and my happiness. I'm not known for compromising.","I'm pretty stressed out.  School's tough, making friends here is a nightmare, and my relationship feels precarious, but I mostly just try to distract myself.

837,"Moving to Austin from Houston felt like a complete shift in perspective.  The new environment fostered a sense of freedom and independence I hadn't experienced before, allowing me to explore my own identity outside the constraints of high school. This newfound freedom has even led me to reconsider some of my previously held beliefs, particularly in regards to political views, making me more open-minded.","My goal of succeeding in college requires consistent effort and time management. I prioritize my studies, especially in Calculus, a subject that provides a sense of accomplishment when I understand and apply new concepts.  When I struggle, I actively seek help from professors or TAs, demonstrating my commitment to mastering the material. This dedication gives me a deep sense of satisfaction, even if I don't always get everything right the first time.","Living in the dorm has been an interesting social experiment.  While I find some interactions draining, particularly with certain superficial individuals, I deeply value my roommate, who is different from anyone I knew in high school.  Her presence has enriched my college experience and shown me the value of friendships based on genuine connection rather than superficial similarities.","Differences of opinion, such as the ones I've encountered with my liberal roommate and my more conservative viewpoints, are approached with an openness to understanding.  My priority is finding common ground and learning from differing perspectives rather than engaging in conflict. This experience has broadened my understanding and fostered intellectual growth.","The transition to college life and leaving my parents has brought moments of stress and anxiety.  These feelings stem partly from my perfectionistic tendencies and high expectations of myself.  To cope, I focus on my studies, particularly Calculus, using the sense of accomplishment it provides as a buffer against these emotions. Seeking help when needed is a way of managing my anxiety in a constructive way.",n,y,y,y,y

The thought experiments, even if they're about something improbable like catching a leprechaun, are stimulating and fun to me.  Afterwards, I feel a sense of playful curiosity; even if the idea is absurd, it's a journey for my mind.","I haven't exactly been known for meticulously planning my future.  Setting and sticking to goals isn't really my strong suit. I tend to flit from one idea to the next without really focusing on long-term strategies. I struggle with sustained effort and organization, and honestly, that's why I'm not doing so great at school.  The thought of all that hard work and preparation feels daunting, but I know someday, somehow, I'll get it done.","Large social gatherings tend to leave me feeling drained, honestly.  I find them overwhelming and noisy. I much prefer smaller groups, or even just being alone. While I might enjoy a quiet conversation with someone I'm close to, my ideal social experience involves minimal interaction and maximum relaxation. This definitely shapes my desire for a quiet life in the country, far away from the stress of crowded spaces.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to avoid confrontation, even if I strongly disagree with someone. My priority is maintaining peace and harmony, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.  I guess you could say I prioritize avoiding conflict over arguing my point. This is probably something I should work on.","Stress and anxiety are frequent visitors. I worry about a lot of things; death, failure, and the overall state of the world are major causes of my anxiety. My initial response is often a retreat into my own thoughts, but eventually, I'll try to find ways to cope, though those methods aren't always effective. Sleep is a big one, though it's not always a solution. I find myself pondering existential questions and potential catastrophes often.",y,n,n,y,y
839,"Last year, I decided to take up pottery.  It was completely outside my comfort zone, and honestly, I was motivated by a desire to try something new and creative.  I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed the process and the feeling of creating something with my hands.  I ended up making a bunch of little bowls!","Getting into UT on a scholarship was a huge goal of mine, requiring consistent effort in my studies.  I created a detailed study schedule and stuck to it diligently, utilizing time management apps to stay organized. While there were definitely tough times, the support of my friends and the ultimate reward of achieving my goal made it all worthwhile.  The most challenging part was maintaining balance between my academic work and social life.  But I learned a lot about self-discipline.","Spending time with Lisa, Lindsey, and Lexie is always energizing. Our shared history and deep connection make conversations easy and fun; we effortlessly bounce ideas off each other.  Being with them is the most fulfilling social experience for me, confirming my preference for close, meaningful relationships over large, superficial groups.","While my friends and I have extremely close relationships, we have our disagreements. Usually, these are minor disagreements about what to watch or where to eat. I try to be understanding of their perspectives. I am always happy to compromise, because our friendship is far more important than any minor disagreement.","The thought of potentially separating from my friends, if I'd not gotten the UT scholarship, caused a great deal of anxiety. My initial reaction was sadness and worry.  Fortunately, I talked it through with my friends, and knowing we'd all still be together eased my worries. That's when I realized how much their presence in my life matters.",y,y,y,y,y

However, starting college itself was a huge change of environment, and though initially overwhelming, it’s been a slow process of adaptation. I’m not sure I would call it ""trying something new"" but more of a necessary transition.","Staying on track with my workouts is a big goal for me. I try to schedule them in advance, and I mostly succeed, although sometimes classes or other things get in the way. I've been trying to be more disciplined about planning my time better and tracking my activities so I can stick to my schedule more effectively.  This helps me avoid feeling overwhelmed and helps me feel less anxious.","Large social gatherings usually leave me feeling drained.  The phone call in class shows how easily I'm overwhelmed even in small settings. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends. Spending time with my close friend is energizing because it's comfortable and familiar. It has taught me that I'm not naturally extroverted and that meaningful connections outweigh large social groups.","I try to avoid conflict, but I do find that conflicts can emerge from having to share a roommate and manage my time. I tend to agree to things even if it causes me stress.  When conflict does arise, I prioritize maintaining the relationship, often at the expense of my own needs. I'll do my best to make others happy, but it sometimes leaves me feeling resentful.","My phone ringing in class triggered a significant anxiety response.  My hand started shaking, and I struggled to focus. I dealt with it by turning off my phone and trying to calm down. Trying to manage my time and avoid being overwhelmed helps lessen my anxiety.

It was mainly motivated by a desire for a change of pace and the chance to meet new people, which is a pretty big deal for me. Afterwards, I felt like I learned something about myself and the people around me.","I don't really plan things out that much; my life is pretty spontaneous.  I'm pretty good at just going with the flow, so this camping trip was kind of the same. It worked for me, but I guess this is something I could work on in the future.  I don't think a lot about things I should be planning and organizing.","The camping trip with those cool older people was definitely energizing.  I like being around other people.  It felt great to connect with people so different from myself, and I realized I enjoy social situations where I can laugh and have fun. It showed me how much I value shared experiences and genuine connections with others, even if we don't have that much in common.","I don't really remember a big disagreement on the trip. I tend to just go with the flow and not cause too many waves. If a conflict arose, I'd probably try to avoid it or laugh it off.  It's not really my style to create problems; I would probably just let it go if it didn't affect me directly.","Getting sick was stressful.  My initial reaction was a little bit of panic – a headache and sore throat are never fun, and the whole camping vibe was suddenly less appealing.  But I just kind of rolled with it – dealt with it.  I don't dwell on stress too much; I try to focus on the positives of the experience and let the negative aspects not get to me too much.",y,n,y,n,n

I don’t employ any consistent strategies for time management or resource allocation; I often get distracted or overwhelmed, leading to procrastination.  The rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment when I *do* manage to complete a task, however fleeting that might be.","Large social gatherings, like the party I'm dreading next week, tend to leave me feeling drained. I much prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending too long around a lot of people often leads to an overwhelming feeling and a need to withdraw and recharge.","Disagreements with my mom, particularly regarding her job choices, are frequent and difficult.  I prioritize understanding her perspective, even though I often struggle with her explanations. Resolving conflict often involves a degree of emotional distance, as I process my feelings before attempting to communicate constructively.","When stressed, as I often am by academic pressures and family issues, I tend to withdraw and become emotionally overwhelmed.  I usually try to manage my emotions through focusing on simple tasks, like studying, but this is not always effective. My anxiety is often compounded by physical symptoms like eye strain and fatigue from my contact lenses.",y,n,n,y,y

I often find myself procrastinating and getting sidetracked.  The pressure of meeting expectations weighs heavily on me, and often leads to feelings of overwhelm and inadequacy.","Social situations leave me drained.

I'm comfortable spending time alone and don't always seek out large groups of people. I enjoy the company of a few close friends, but I definitely don't thrive in large, boisterous settings.  The fact that I'm writing this late at night, mostly to myself, is probably telling.","Disagreements are frustrating and I usually avoid direct confrontation. I tend to just let things slide rather than engaging in debate or conflict. If pushed, I may become annoyed or express my frustration indirectly.  The essay shows this —  my irritation at my computer problems comes out in sloppy typing, rather than a direct expression of my feelings.","Stress and anxiety manifest in me as frustration and impatience, which then makes me even less efficient at completing tasks.  I initially react by getting angry or agitated, but then I tend to distract myself, which is why I found myself listening to music while writing this.

The thought of meeting new people and dealing with so much information does push me to try new study habits, even if I am a bit scared of what is to come.","My essay shows a clear lack of conscientiousness. While I want to succeed in school and get into business school, my approach is more reactive than proactive.

While I mention needing to earn a scholarship, my essay shows a relatively relaxed approach to college life, prioritizing immediate experiences over structured planning.  My lack of concern about academics, at least initially, points towards less conscientiousness.","The social experiences I describe are fairly low-key.

I make lists and try to stick to schedules, though sometimes I'm distracted by random thoughts (like daydreaming about Lake Tahoe!). My biggest challenge is balancing my commitments; I have to be careful about taking on too much.","Social interactions tend to drain me.  I prefer quiet time to recharge. The Spanish pop quiz is a good example - the stress made my stomach hurt.  I enjoy close relationships with my brother and a few friends, like Cory.

I prefer avoiding direct confrontation;  it's easier to let things slide or try to work things out indirectly.  I prioritize maintaining good relationships and harmony.","I'm prone to anxiety, and the Spanish pop quiz sent me into a spiral of worry. My initial response was a knot in my stomach and a feeling of dread. I cope by distracting myself with tasks, like this writing assignment.

Balancing classes, work, and a social life is a major challenge, but I'm making lists and setting daily goals to stay on top of my responsibilities.  Staying committed is difficult because I’m easily distracted, but having a solid plan helps.  The reward is knowing I'm making progress, even if it's slow.

The conversation, laughter, and connection helped me de-stress and feel more positive.  Solitude is important to me, but I realize spending time with those I enjoy really helps me recharge.  It confirmed that I need a balance between social interaction and alone time.","I haven't had any major disagreements yet, but the essay shows I'm struggling with the breakup with my ex and how to handle that.  I'm trying to be understanding and patient while giving myself time to heal. I prioritize emotional well-being, so avoidance and direct communication are both important strategies for me depending on the situation and who I am talking to.","Starting college has been incredibly stressful!

I make lists and try to prioritize, but it's a constant struggle. Honestly, I often fall short of my goals due to feeling overwhelmed. Staying committed is tough when I'm constantly exhausted and stressed. The rewarding part is seeing my pledge sisters and having fun at sorority events.

I felt a new sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of my own artistic capabilities.","I set a goal to finish writing and recording a new album within six months.  To stay on track, I created a detailed schedule, allocating specific times for writing, recording, and mixing.  I meticulously managed my resources, prioritizing my time and creative energy to ensure that I made steady progress.

Ultimately, it was a mixed experience—positive in terms of peace and quiet, but it also reinforced some of my anxieties about men.","I don't really set goals in the traditional sense. My life operates more on a day-to-day basis.  I struggle with sustained effort – as this essay writing deadline clearly indicates.

While I know I *should* focus on school, it's hard for me to stay motivated and on task.","Going out and partying with my friends definitely energizes me.  The shared laughter, the excitement of the night, and the feeling of connection with others always leaves me feeling really good.  Conversely, I can find social interaction in classes incredibly draining; I don't care for being around people who aren't fun. This showed me that I prefer social settings that are high energy and celebratory.","I don't handle disagreements very well, to be honest. If someone disagrees with me and I know they're wrong I tend to dismiss their perspective. This is probably why I don't get along with a lot of my Asian friends because I often find their perspectives to be frustrating.  I prioritize my own opinions, especially when it comes to someone I don't particularly like.","I don't really get stressed or anxious often.  Life is pretty chill, especially if I'm doing fun things with friends or when I'm seeing a cute girl. If I am ever stressed about something it is generally fleeting, and I try to just avoid it.",y,n,y,n,n

The only time I tried something new recently was when I reluctantly used the other washing machine because mine was full of someone else's clothes. It wasn't a positive experience, as I found it inconvenient and stressful to deal with someone else's belongings.  I much prefer things to be orderly and predictable.","I'm not particularly organized or detail-oriented. I don't set long-term goals, and if I do, I don't always stick to them.  I tend to focus on immediate tasks.  For example, I love doing laundry and I find that task satisfying and calming, but I don't necessarily plan it out or create a schedule for it.  The satisfaction comes from the immediate result: clean, soft-smelling clothes.","Social interactions often drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings or spending time alone.  The laundry room incident left me feeling annoyed and slightly stressed. I'd rather avoid situations where I have to interact with people who aren't considerate of others' needs. I am energized by quiet time and solitary activities.","I generally try to be agreeable, but I can get frustrated with people who are inconsiderate. When I disagree with someone, like in the laundry room situation, I try to handle it calmly. I prefer to find a compromise or solution that respects everyone's needs, even if it means dealing with a bit of frustration from their lack of responsibility. My priority is usually a quick and efficient resolution to minimize unnecessary conflict.","I tend to worry and get stressed easily. The computer programming class, for instance, makes me anxious. I handle stress by focusing on the immediate task at hand – finishing the class so I can get it over with – and finding things that comfort me, like doing laundry and watching TV. I don't always deal with things constructively, I tend to avoid the source of my stress rather than address it directly.",n,n,n,y,y
875,"While I haven't done anything radically outside my comfort zone recently, starting to cook this summer was a novel experience.  It wasn't something I'd ever considered before, but the enjoyment of creating something tangible and sharing it with others was unexpectedly rewarding. I was motivated by a desire for self-sufficiency and a longing to create something beautiful.  It has expanded my horizons beyond my usual interests.","Balancing school, the need for a job to support myself through college, and maintaining my social life has required a great deal of planning.  I use a planner to track deadlines and prioritize tasks. My main strategy for staying committed is setting small, achievable goals, as well as breaking down larger goals into smaller, less daunting steps. While juggling everything is challenging at times, the satisfaction of making progress keeps me motivated.","Family reunions are usually energizing for me. Being surrounded by loved ones and sharing happy moments creates a positive atmosphere.  I thrive on these kinds of social interactions where I can connect with people who care about me and who I care about. The opposite is true of large social gatherings with people I do not know, that would leave me feeling drained instead. I prefer smaller, intimate gatherings with people I know and feel close to.","I generally try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.  Even if I strongly disagree, I listen to the other person's perspective before voicing my opinion.  My priority is to find common ground and resolve the conflict peacefully, maintaining a positive relationship. While my emotional reactions may be intense at times, I strive to use calm communication to ease tension.","My anxieties about college grades and finances are constant. I react initially with worry and self-doubt, often leading to emotional responses such as frustration and sadness. To cope, I try to break down my problems into smaller, manageable pieces, which makes them less overwhelming.  Seeking support from my family helps tremendously.",n,y,y,y,y
876,"I’m drawn to new experiences, even if they’re a bit chaotic.  For instance, impulsively signing up for a pottery class completely outside my comfort zone – the messy process, the unfamiliar tools, it was all a thrilling departure from my routine. The initial motivation was pure curiosity and a desire to challenge myself creatively. I found the experience rewarding; the end product was less important than the process of learning and exploring something completely new.","I'm a bit of a free spirit, but I also value achieving my goals, even if my approach is unorthodox. I set a goal to finish writing a novel, which requires sustained effort and discipline.  I tackled it in bursts of intense focused work, driven by intense passion, rather than adhering to a rigid schedule. I often found it challenging to balance my writing with other aspects of life, but the sense of accomplishment when I finally completed the novel was incredibly rewarding.","Honestly, large social gatherings drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can have deeper connections with people who understand my perspective.  A memorable draining experience involved a crowded party. The noise, the superficial conversations, left me feeling exhausted.  This experience reinforced my preference for meaningful interactions with a select few rather than broad, shallow social encounters.","Disagreements are inevitable. Recently, I had a heated debate with a friend about political ideologies. Instead of avoiding the conflict, I engaged in a frank, yet respectful discussion to fully understand his viewpoint, which I think we both benefited from. My priority was mutual understanding, not necessarily agreement. Ultimately, it strengthened our friendship, demonstrating the value of open communication.","I tend to be quite emotional and prone to anxiety. When things get stressful, my first reaction is often an emotional outburst, but I quickly try to ground myself. My strategy involves deep breathing, creative expression (like writing) and spending time in nature. The combination of these approaches helps to regulate my emotions and provides the clarity to approach the situation constructively.",y,y,n,y,y
877,"I don't often seek out entirely new experiences; I'm pretty comfortable with my routine.  The thought of trying something radically different makes me a little anxious. Getting a new computer a month ago was probably the closest I've come recently to that, and even then, I'm still figuring it out. I guess the motivation was the need for something functional for school. Overall, it was...okay.","I wouldn't say I'm the most organized person. Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my forte. I tend to procrastinate, and I'm not particularly good at managing my time or resources. My upcoming test is a good example. I've probably put off studying more than I should have, and I'm not exactly thrilled about the prospect of facing the challenge.  The rewarding part might come if I somehow pass without too much stress.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I know and trust, like my boyfriend, JR.  Overwhelming social situations feel intrusive, making me value my personal space and quiet time to recharge. Spending time with JR is much more fulfilling; it's easy, comfortable, and calming.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep it to myself rather than creating a confrontation. It’s not that I'm afraid of confrontation, but I really value peace and quiet. If the disagreement is unavoidable, I prefer to handle it passively to maintain a low-conflict environment. I will prioritize maintaining the relationship over winning the argument.","I don't usually get overly stressed, although dealing with the computer problems and schoolwork made me a bit frustrated.  I just get on with things.  When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I often distract myself with music, like Leah Anrioni's music; focusing on the lyrics helps to calm me down and refocus my mind.  My emotions aren't usually hard to manage.",n,n,n,y,n

I rarely prioritize tasks effectively, leading to feeling overwhelmed.  Structure and organization are not my strengths.",Social situations usually drain my energy.  I find large groups and loud environments incredibly overwhelming and prefer to be alone or with a small group of close friends.  Over-stimulation makes it difficult for me to focus and leaves me feeling exhausted.,"Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I often avoid conflict, even if I don’t agree.  I tend to prioritize keeping the peace over expressing my own opinions forcefully, to prevent additional stress.  It's easier to just let things slide.",I’m easily stressed and anxious.

879,"I'm not exactly someone who actively seeks out brand-new experiences.  My essay reflects a pretty typical college routine—classes, clubs, seeing friends. While I haven't done anything radically different lately, going to the SSA meeting feels like a slight step outside my comfort zone. It's more about the people than the activity itself.","I'm pretty good at sticking to plans when I'm motivated (like seeing my friend after such a long time). However, my essay shows a clear lack of follow-through in less pressing areas. The thank-you cards and my checkbook are prime examples. While I recognize the importance, actually doing it is another matter. The routine of classes helps maintain some structure, but I easily slip up on self-imposed deadlines.","The SSA meeting is something I'm looking forward to because I know the people involved. That social interaction sounds energizing.  Conversely, the calculus class sounds draining, as the existing friend groups feel exclusionary.  I clearly prefer socializing with people I already have a connection with; creating new bonds in unfamiliar environments is difficult for me.",I tend to avoid direct conflict; the essay doesn't depict a direct confrontation. My approach to disagreements is probably avoidance or indirect communication—I may prioritize maintaining the relationship over directly expressing my own disagreement.  The calculus class example highlights my preference for harmony within my social circles; it’s easier to avoid the “snobby” group than confront them.,"The cricket in my room is a funny example of a minor stressor. The essay shows how even small annoyances can get to me.  My response is usually to try and fix it (looking for the cricket), but if it’s something I can't control, I mostly just grumble about it internally and then move on. I don't dwell too much on anxieties.",n,y,y,y,n

The lyrics and videos I described show this; the constant flow of ideas and images reflects my openness to diverse experiences.  Trying new things keeps life interesting and feeds my imagination, which is crucial to my writing.  Afterwards, I feel energized and inspired, even if the experience was initially daunting.","I struggle with sustained effort towards long-term goals.  My essay shows a pattern of impulsive shifts in focus and a lack of consistent planning. While I'm devoted to writing, I don't have a structured approach to it, and my procrastination is evident in my stream of consciousness writing style.  I lack the organizational skills and self-discipline to maintain consistent progress, which leads to feelings of overwhelm and frustration.","Social situations usually drain me. The essay highlights my preference for solitude and dislike of constant interaction, particularly with noisy or demanding people. My roommate's phone calls and intrusive vendors bother me. I crave quiet time to recharge and focus on my creative pursuits.  This need for solitude shapes my preference for solitary activities and limits my desire for extensive social engagement.","I often clash with others. The rant about my roommate's phone calls and the generalized frustration over people interrupting me demonstrates a lack of agreeableness. While I don't actively seek conflict, I struggle with compromise and patience. My priorities are my own peace and quiet, which sometimes conflicts with the needs of others, leading to passive-aggressive responses.","I experience high levels of stress and anxiety. My essay reveals this through frequent expressions of frustration, anger, and a yearning for a utopian escape. The overwhelming thoughts and feelings described reflect significant levels of internal distress and a need for constant stimulation to avoid being overwhelmed by negative emotions. My coping mechanisms include escapism through media, fantasy writing, and a tendency towards self-centered thinking.",y,n,n,n,y

I create to-do lists and try to stick to a schedule, but I often find myself procrastinating, which is something I'm actively trying to improve.  My biggest challenge is balancing the need to be responsible with my tendency to put things off.

I make to-do lists and try to stick to a study schedule, though I often find myself distracted and procrastinating.  Staying focused is tough.  It's rewarding when I get good grades, but challenging when I feel overwhelmed and behind.","Most social interactions here feel draining.  I miss the familiarity and comfort of my friends back home.  Being surrounded by strangers is exhausting.  I think I need smaller, more intimate interactions to feel energized, rather than large, noisy gatherings. This experience highlights how much I value close friendships and familiar environments.","I haven't really had major disagreements here yet.  Most interactions are pretty superficial,  I guess. If I do disagree with someone, I tend to avoid conflict and keep my opinions to myself to maintain the peace rather than rock the boat.","Being away from home and feeling so lonely has made me incredibly anxious and stressed.

It was stressful and overwhelming, but I don’t think I'd call it enjoyable.","I'm definitely not someone who plans ahead. This essay, for example, is a testament to my poor time management skills. I procrastinate, and rarely meet deadlines.  Even when I set a goal, like maintaining a 4.0 GPA, which is almost impossible because my parents put too much pressure on me to be perfect, I struggle to stick to it.  I often feel overwhelmed and resort to avoidance tactics.","Social situations can be draining for me.

While it's easy to go along with what others want, which is why I haven't directly confronted my roommate,  it sometimes leads to resentment.  I tend to bottle things up rather than stating my feelings directly. I often wish I were more assertive, even if it means some unpleasantness.","I get stressed easily, particularly when my study routine is disrupted or I feel unheard by those around me.  I tend to withdraw and focus on my feelings, often ruminate rather than actively addressing the problem. My girlfriend, being understanding and supportive, usually helps me manage those feelings. My emotional reactions to my roommate’s actions significantly impact my stress levels.",y,n,n,y,n
894,"I impulsively decided to try a stream-of-consciousness writing exercise, which was completely new to me.  I was motivated by the assignment's unusual nature and the intrigue of exploring my own thoughts uninhibitedly.  Afterwards, I felt a sense of liberation, though somewhat overwhelmed by the unfiltered output of my mind.","Balancing school, work, and a relationship has been incredibly challenging. My time management is less than stellar; I often feel overwhelmed and struggle to prioritize tasks effectively.  There's a tension between immediate gratification (spending time with my boyfriend) and long-term goals (finishing school, having my own place).  I often find myself falling short of my goals.","Social interactions are a mixed bag.  Parties at work energize me, as long as I can relate to the people.  Arguments with my boyfriend leave me drained and emotionally overwhelmed.  These experiences highlight my need for genuine connection rather than superficial social engagements, as well as the need for space and time to myself.","Disagreements, particularly with Rita, leave me feeling furious.  I tend to be assertive, even confrontational, rather than compromising; I don't hold back on expressing my negative feelings.  My priority is to express my anger and let the other person know how I feel; constructive resolution isn't always my first concern.","Stress manifests in intense emotional reactions; yesterday was a case in point.  Everything going wrong left me feeling completely overwhelmed.  My initial response is to become easily frustrated and agitated, and I frequently dwell on setbacks.  I struggle with self-soothing and often need time alone to process my feelings and try to regain some semblance of calm.",y,n,y,n,y
895,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck in a rut. The thought of trying something completely new feels daunting right now. My focus is on fixing the immediate problems in my life before I branch out.","I struggle with long-term goals.  I set ambitious goals, like finishing college and starting a career, but I haven't established effective systems for managing my time or resources to achieve them.  Procrastination and discouragement are big obstacles; it's easier to avoid the pressure than to face it.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling completely drained.  Being around a lot of people is overwhelming and emphasizes my feelings of being alone and out of place. I crave genuine connections rather than superficial interactions, but finding those takes more energy than I currently have.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid conflict, even when I know I'm right.  Right now, prioritizing my own well-being and mental health often feels more important than confronting others, even if it means compromising my needs.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My initial response is often self-criticism and negativity.  I usually try to distract myself or wallow in my feelings, which is hardly productive.  I recognize the need for healthier coping mechanisms, but I haven't found ones that work consistently.",y,n,y,n,y
896,"I’m not usually one for trying new things, but I did have a really intense emotional experience recently that was unexpected.  It involved a powerful vision of my future with the woman I love, and it totally changed my perspective.  It felt almost spiritual, and the impact of that feeling has been lasting.","I don't really plan things out; I'm not a very organized person.  This whole writing exercise is a good example – I'm just letting my thoughts flow, not working to a schedule or plan.  I find it difficult to maintain consistent effort towards goals; I prefer to follow my impulses.","Talking to my girlfriend on the phone was incredibly energizing.  It's that feeling of deep connection and shared understanding that truly fills me up.  I thrive on such intense interactions, even if I pretend to be nonchalant to keep her guessing.  Being with her completely revitalizes me.","I don’t always handle disagreements well; I can be quite self-centered.   In my recent interactions with my girlfriend, I briefly prioritized seeming less interested, which was ultimately a selfish act intended to test her feelings. I didn't approach it directly, choosing instead to create a sense of intrigue and playfully push her away.","I don’t usually get stressed or anxious,  but worrying about my girlfriend being away from me really got to me. But the vision I had of her and our future gave me a sense of peace, even joy, that resolved that. This experience really showed me the power of positive thinking and envisioning a happy future with her.",y,n,y,n,n
897,"I don't often seek out entirely new experiences.  My mind tends to wander, focusing more on internal thoughts and feelings than external adventures.  Even trying something slightly different, like a new food, feels like a significant effort. I prefer familiar routines and activities.","I do set goals, such as taping my soaps or starting an aerobics program, but maintaining consistent effort isn't a strength. My motivation fluctuates wildly;  I'll get excited about something then lose interest quickly. Time management is a real struggle for me, often leading to missed opportunities and unfinished tasks.","Social interactions generally drain me. Even seeing friends can feel tiring. Large gatherings are overwhelming, and I prefer spending time alone. I need significant alone time to recharge after even brief social engagements. This essay shows my tendency to be introspective.","Disagreements are difficult for me; I often avoid confrontation. While I may have strong opinions (like my dislike of certain TV characters or people in the game), I avoid direct conflict.  My priority is usually to retreat and minimize friction, even if it means ignoring or avoiding others' negative behaviors.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  I often feel tired and overwhelmed. My immediate response is often avoidance, but sometimes I resort to complaining. Eventually, I try to escape the situation or find a distraction, like watching TV, but it’s often a temporary solution.",n,y,n,y,y
898,"I once impulsively signed up for a breakdancing class.  The sheer absurdity of it – me, breakdancing – appealed to my sense of the unexpected. I felt surprisingly exhilarated during the class itself, despite my many, many falls, but afterward, a wave of self-consciousness washed over me. It was fun, but not something I'd pursue further.","Goals?  Ha!  I’m more of a “go with the flow” type.  The closest I get to a sustained effort is remembering to eat—some days.  I tend to let things slide, especially when faced with anything even slightly challenging.  Honestly, the lack of structure is something I find rewarding, at least for now.","Most social situations drain me.  My roommate's constant chatter is a prime example.  I find that deep, meaningful conversations are better than large, loud groups. I prefer the company of my own thoughts, and the quiet contemplation of a grey day or a chicken coop, for that matter. The need for quiet time far outweighs any desire for large social gatherings.","I avoid conflict whenever possible. I'll usually just say nothing, nod and agree and then retreat to my room. Direct confrontation gives me a headache. My priorities are keeping the peace and escaping awkward encounters. I'm not going to win a battle of wills.","Stress and anxiety are my companions. A vague headache is a near constant.  I cope by withdrawing, shutting myself off, focusing on insignificant things like the color of the paint on my door or what's in my fridge.  Sometimes that works, sometimes I just have to accept that things are going to stay as frustrating as ever.",y,n,n,n,y
899,"Learning to solve a Rubik's cube felt like a completely new challenge. My brother's teaching motivated me to try it, offering a break from my current anxieties.  The process itself is fascinating, and while I sometimes give up easily, this time, the persistence feels oddly fulfilling.","Getting into business school is my major goal.  It demands consistent effort, and I am struggling to stay on track. I haven't yet established a concrete plan; my approach is more reactive than proactive, focusing on tackling immediate challenges as they arise.  The challenge is immense, yet the determination to prove everyone wrong is my driving force.","Most social experiences drain my energy.  I find small talk exhausting and prefer deeper, more meaningful connections. The essay shows I value my close relationships more than large social gatherings.   I recharge best in quiet moments, but I am able to find fulfillment in helping my friends.","Disagreements are difficult; I often avoid direct confrontation. With my father, I prioritize avoiding conflict by minimizing interaction.  My relationship with my brother is the opposite, I seem to be able to handle disagreements with him.","Feeling stressed or anxious is frequent. My initial response is often avoidance and distraction (like going to bed at 2 a.m.). Ultimately, I turn to writing to process these emotions, a healthy outlet compared to my previous reliance on alcohol. My anxieties and mood swings are clearly described in the essay.",y,n,n,y,y
900,"I'm not sure I've ever really sought out something completely new,  I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable.  This essay itself is a bit outside my comfort zone, but honestly, it's mostly because I'm expected to do it, not because I have some deep-seated desire to explore new ideas.  I prefer familiar routines and people.","I set a goal to keep up with my schoolwork while I'm home.  It’s been a struggle to manage my time because there’s so much going on. I really try to stay on top of things, making lists and such. However, when my friends are around, it's hard to stay focused on homework.   There’s a constant internal battle between responsibility and having fun with people I don’t often get to see.",A night out with my friends in Tyler is always energizing!  Being with people I care about and having fun is extremely fulfilling.  I recharge from being around them.  Quiet time alone leaves me feeling a little more drained than usual. I value and need these social interactions and am generally happy in large social groups.,"I try to avoid conflict, and I don't often strongly disagree with people. If I do, I usually just keep quiet or change the subject to preserve harmony.  My priority is keeping things peaceful and friendly, even if it means not expressing my own opinion fully.","When I feel stressed, like when I think about all the homework I have, I tend to get overwhelmed. I usually try to distract myself, perhaps by going out with friends or watching tv. I don't deal with stress very well and avoid it when possible. I'd rather focus on fun things happening in the moment.",n,y,y,y,n
901,"I'm always trying new things, even if it’s just putting on a different CD to break up the monotony.  I haven’t exactly gone bungee jumping, but trying new music or even just making a new recipe feels like a small adventure.  I’m motivated by boredom, mostly – anything to break up the routine!  Afterwards, I feel a sense of accomplishment, even if it’s just a small change.","Getting my laundry done, mailing cards, and staying on top of my workouts are all goals that require effort.  I try to make lists and break things down into smaller, manageable tasks to stay on track.  Remembering things is tough, though, so I rely on lists and reminders.  Staying committed is hard sometimes, especially when I'm tired or bored, but I usually keep going! The reward is the sense of accomplishment – and a clean room!","Being connected to friends and family through email and phone calls is important, but it is definitely tiring. I miss Greg, so when I can go home and see him it energizes me.  Social interaction is tiring, especially with the costs of phone calls, so mostly I keep to myself.  Long phone calls are expensive, so I rely on emails mostly.","I haven't had many big disagreements lately. When I do, I try to be understanding but also to be honest about my feelings.  I prioritize clear communication, and I generally avoid direct conflict as much as possible. If there's something important, I'll work to find common ground.  Sometimes I wish communicating was easier.","Being away from home and my boyfriend makes me anxious, and the hot weather doesn't help. I respond by keeping busy, focusing on things I can control—like my schoolwork or my workouts. I try to stay positive, but sometimes the feelings still linger. The stress mostly comes from missing home and my boyfriend and the cost of phone calls.",y,y,y,y,y
902,"I once decided to take a pottery class, something completely outside my usual routine.  I was motivated by a desire to try something creative and relaxing, a contrast to my often anxious mind.  The experience was surprisingly fulfilling; I found a sense of calm and satisfaction in working with my hands and creating something tangible.","I set a goal to finish my college application process well in advance of the deadlines.  I created a detailed timeline, breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  I used a planner and set reminders to keep myself on track. While there were moments of procrastination, I generally stayed committed because of the importance of the goal.  The most rewarding part was the sense of accomplishment upon completion.  The challenge was juggling the application process with my other responsibilities and occasional feelings of overwhelm.","A recent memorable social experience was attending a small gathering with close friends.  The interaction was incredibly energizing;  the relaxed atmosphere and genuine connection with those I love created a safe and positive environment. It reinforced my preference for intimate social settings over large, crowded events.","I recently had a disagreement with a friend about political views. I chose to listen to their perspective carefully and express my own views respectfully, focusing on finding common ground rather than winning the argument.  My priority was to maintain our friendship while still being true to myself. I believe that compromise and mutual understanding are important in any disagreement.","When I feel stressed, I initially tend to overthink and worry. To manage this, I try to engage in activities that calm me, such as listening to music, spending time in nature, or talking to someone I trust. These strategies help me process my emotions and approach the situation in a more balanced way.  The essay suggests a high capacity for compassion and forgiveness, indicating a resilience that counters natural neuroticism.",y,y,y,y,n
903,"I'm not one for radically new experiences.  The essay reflects my preference for familiar things – I wish for a specific band at a concert, I miss a specific program (thlp), and I'm frustrated by unfamiliar situations with Mark. While I enjoyed Hamlet, it was something I should have experienced earlier in my life, not a spontaneous dive into the unknown.  Novelty isn't a huge driver for me.","The essay shows a lack of rigid planning. I'm up late on a weekend, procrastinating on homework (distracted by my buddy list), and feeling guilty about neglecting church.  My approach to goals seems more impulsive and less structured.  While I care about my friends, my support is less about action planning and more about emotional presence.","The essay reveals a preference for smaller, intimate interactions. My frustration stems from situations requiring me to give advice to Mark – a close friend – rather than large social gatherings.  I find comfort in familiar relationships and find navigating unfamiliar social dynamics draining, preferring the company of close friends like Mark over larger crowds or new people.","I value my relationships, as shown by my concern for my friends Mark and Stephen, and my reflections on past friendships with Rachel. While I don’t explicitly describe a conflict in the essay, my generally agreeable nature is evident in my concern for others' feelings and my desire to maintain relationships. I may avoid direct confrontation, preferring to process feelings internally.","The late-night writing and the stream of consciousness suggest a degree of underlying anxiety.  While I don’t explicitly mention feeling stressed, the essay displays my worries about various aspects of my life –  Mark’s situation, my friends' behavior, and my own shortcomings (church). The late-night writing itself can be interpreted as a way to process these feelings.",n,n,y,y,n
904,"I'm not sure I'd describe myself as particularly open to new experiences.  While I did start at UT Austin, which was new and different from Purdue, I mostly focus on what I already know and miss the comfort and familiarity of my old friends and routines.  New things tend to just add to my stress rather than excite me.","I definitely struggle with managing my time effectively.  Getting my Organic Chemistry textbook and studying for the upcoming exam are major goals, but I’ve gotten behind due to computer issues and waiting on others. My time management involves more reacting to immediate crises than any structured plan.   I'm more focused on finishing my current assignments rather than proactively planning for future tasks.",Social interactions generally drain me. My essay reveals my frustration with my friend's boyfriend who is distracting me while I'm trying to work. I prefer the company of my close friends from Purdue but am stressed by the lack of that support system in my current situation.  I seem to prefer smaller circles of people.,"I don't often openly confront conflict. In the situation with my friend's boyfriend, I avoid direct confrontation because I feel dependent on her computer, prioritizing politeness to maintain access over asserting my needs. My focus is mostly on managing my own stress levels rather than addressing the conflict directly.","I'm clearly quite neurotic. My essay is filled with anxieties about schoolwork, computer problems, and missing my friends. My initial response to stress is often frustration and worry, as demonstrated by my complaints about waiting and my constant preoccupation with my lack of progress. I tend to internalize my anxieties and don't have clear strategies for coping, instead focusing on the immediate source of my stress.",y,y,y,n,y
905,"I don't often seek out radically new experiences; I tend to stick to what's familiar and comfortable.  The thought of trying something completely different often fills me with anxiety.  While I can appreciate the potential benefits of expanding my horizons, the effort and uncertainty involved usually outweigh my desire to do so. This essay, for example, was far outside my comfort zone.","I struggle with long-term goals.  Procrastination is a constant battle, and my time management skills could certainly use improvement.  While I *want* to succeed, I often lack the discipline to consistently follow through on my plans, especially when faced with challenges like the difficulty of this calculus homework. This assignment is a good example of this, as I only started it because someone else reminded me.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. Large groups or loud environments are particularly overwhelming.  I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends or quiet solitude. I find deep conversations more enjoyable than shallow interactions. The few social interactions mentioned in this essay are primarily stressful, like potential phone calls.","I tend to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to minimize the confrontation, even if it means compromising my own needs or opinions.  Direct confrontation is uncomfortable and unsettling for me. This essay shows a clear avoidance of conflict in my reaction to others' potential responses to my writing.","Stress and anxiety are common for me.  My initial reaction to pressure is often avoidance or procrastination, as seen in my struggle with the calculus assignment.  I find that simply acknowledging my feelings of stress and anxiety and taking small, manageable steps toward resolving the issue is the most helpful approach. This essay clearly shows a neurotic reaction to the task and to a variety of other concerns and anxieties.",n,y,n,n,n
906,"I don't really seek out new experiences or ways of thinking; I'm pretty content with my routine.  The essay reflects this, focusing on the practical tasks of the day.  Trying something new isn't a high priority for me.  I prefer familiarity and predictability.","The essay shows my focus on completing tasks and staying organized.  Getting work done, managing my time to balance school and work, and preparing for the day demonstrates my conscientiousness.  I prioritize efficiency and meeting deadlines.  My challenge is often managing the sheer volume of things I need to accomplish.","I enjoy spending time with friends and going to movies, as mentioned in my essay, suggesting I recharge my batteries around people I'm close to. Large, boisterous social gatherings probably wouldn't energize me, though.  Quality time with a few friends in a relaxed setting is my preferred social interaction.","My essay doesn’t show any conflict, but I would generally prioritize maintaining harmony in relationships.  I would likely try to find common ground and avoid direct confrontation, valuing cooperation. Disagreements would be handled calmly and with a focus on mutual understanding.","The essay clearly shows signs of stress from work and school. I don't dwell on the anxiety, but I also don't shy away from the fact that I'm overwhelmed. My strategy for coping is primarily focusing on completing immediate tasks to reduce my feelings of being overwhelmed.  Planning specific next steps is a helpful way to combat anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n
907,"I’ve always been a huge sports fan, particularly of the San Antonio Spurs.  However, this past weekend I tried something new:  I made a point of watching the Dallas Cowboys game, a team I usually don't follow. The motivation was simply a desire to experience the excitement of a season opener, and I ended up feeling really enthusiastic about the whole thing. It reminded me of how much I enjoy the atmosphere of live sports.","I definitely struggle with long-term goals.  While I'm passionate about things, I'm not always great at consistently dedicating myself to achieving them. For example,  I intended to attend all the Longhorns games this season, but haven't managed it because of other priorities and spontaneous plans.  My time management is usually pretty flexible. I'm more focused on seizing the moment and enjoying things that happen spontaneously.","The Spurs championship victory is a great example of an energizing social experience. Being downtown with friends, amidst the excitement, was incredibly fulfilling.  However, when my friend’s graduation party lacked a TV to watch the game, it turned into a frustrating experience.  I learned that while I love being social, having my own time and space (to watch the game!) is incredibly important.","The situation with my friend's graduation party highlighted a conflict. I wanted to watch the game, she didn't provide the means to, and my solution—lying to leave the party—wasn't the best way to handle things. I prioritized my own desire to watch the game over consideration for my friend's family, which I regret; their feelings are really important to me.","The years I spent agonizing over the Spurs' playoff losses caused me significant anxiety.  I'd cry and get incredibly down; my hopes were just crushed. I dealt with it by retreating and focusing on my feelings, and ultimately seeking out a place to watch the game even though I had to leave the party, ultimately making a somewhat bad decision.  Looking back, it shows me the power of my emotions, and how easily they can overcome my judgment.",y,n,y,y,n
908,"I wouldn't say I'm a huge risk-taker, but I'm open to new experiences.  For instance, I recently started listening to a new music genre, and although it's not quite my thing, I appreciate that it helped broaden my musical palette.  It also made me think about how limiting sticking only to what I like can be.  I'm not about to abandon my favorite music, but it was a good way to stretch myself.","I'm pretty organized, and when I have a deadline, I get things done. Like, I'm writing this assignment really early because I want to relax and enjoy the rest of my evening. I don’t want last-minute stress. I plan out my time, break down large tasks into smaller chunks, and if I encounter difficulties, I just adapt my schedule to fit in problem-solving time. It’s rewarding when I finish a task ahead of schedule, but it’s often challenging when unexpected things pop up.","I love hanging out with my friends and family. Seeing Ashley this weekend and meeting Seth’s friends has me really excited – social events energize me. A draining experience? Probably when I'm forced into some huge social gathering where I'm obligated to be social and I don't know anyone or I feel the need to put on a performance.  I value meaningful connections, rather than large, superficial social groups.","I try to be understanding and agreeable, even when I disagree.  The situation with my mom and Rachel’s mom requires understanding and patience. This is because Rachel is one of my best friends and family is a very high priority. While we have had conflicts in the past, I’m committed to keeping our friendship strong. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, even when there are disagreements.","I can definitely get stressed and anxious, especially when I'm waiting on important news, like an email. The news about Bonnie and Meme having cancer also made me very anxious and stressed, I'm worried about them. In these situations,  I try to distract myself—listen to music, write, or do something else to take my mind off it. Sometimes talking to my best friend Rachel helps me to soothe my nerves as well.

I found the process surprisingly relaxing and rewarding, though my final product was…let's just say it wasn't exactly museum-worthy.","I've never been one for strict schedules; I tend to approach goals with a more relaxed attitude.  This sometimes means I miss deadlines or don't completely achieve what I set out to do, which frustrates me.  I find it easier to stay motivated when I have some flexibility.","Large, loud social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  I recharge by spending time alone or with a select few people, as opposed to large groups that demand a lot of energy from me.","Disagreements are inevitable. I usually try to find common ground, focusing on understanding the other person’s perspective.  My priorities are maintaining a reasonably amiable relationship while also ensuring my own needs are considered. However, I'm not always the best at avoiding conflict entirely.",Stress and anxiety are common for me. I often initially feel overwhelmed and frustrated.

The thought of drastically changing my routine or trying something completely unfamiliar fills me with a certain level of dread. I'm more focused on immediate gratification and familiar pleasures, like hanging out with friends and having a good time.","Honestly, I’m not the most organized person.  I often procrastinate, and meeting deadlines is a constant struggle.  My time management skills could definitely use some work;  I usually end up cramming things at the last minute.  The fear of negative consequences – like having to go home and do yard work – motivates me, but it’s not a sustainable approach.","Last night was a blast! Going out with Felicia and my friend, even though it was probably his last night, was energizing.  Being around people who make me laugh and enjoy myself is what truly fulfills me.  I thrive in social situations, especially when it involves some fun and excitement – and it definitely beats being alone.","I don't handle disagreements well.  If someone disagrees with me, particularly if they're being a ""bitch"" about it (like my girlfriend sometimes is), I tend to get angry and react defensively. My priorities are proving my point and standing up for myself, which may not always lead to resolving the conflict peacefully. I need to work on my reaction.","I get stressed out easily. When I woke up and realized I had homework to do, my immediate reaction was annoyance and procrastination. The thought of my roommate leaving and all the other issues in my life fueled the stress.  I cope by distracting myself, sometimes with alcohol and partying, but that’s not a very healthy or effective long-term solution.",n,n,y,n,y
911,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who readily embraces new experiences.  The essay reflects my hesitancy to fully immerse myself in the college environment, preferring the familiar comforts of home and established friendships. Trying something completely new feels daunting; it's easier to stick to what I know.","My goal of majoring in Management Information Systems at UT requires significant dedication. I manage my time by diligently following my class schedule and creating to-do lists to stay organized. I prioritize my studies, even if it means sacrificing social activities. While the workload is challenging, the potential reward of a successful career in MIS keeps me motivated.","The social experience described in my essay—feeling left out and isolated at UT while my friend thrives at UNT—left me feeling drained and quite lonely.  The lack of pre-existing connections and the contrast with my friend's positive social life heightened my feelings of inadequacy and isolation. It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social circles.","The conflict with my friend, feeling she prioritizes her boyfriend over our friendship, was difficult. I didn't confront her directly; my essay reflects the internalized conflict. My priority was to process my emotions and avoid potential conflict; confronting her might risk damaging our already strained relationship further.","The homesickness and anxiety about adjusting to college life described in my essay are examples of my high neuroticism. My initial response to stress is to retreat and overthink. I try to manage these feelings by talking to my parents for comfort, but the underlying anxiety about the unknown and the fear of failure persist.",n,y,n,y,y
912,"I haven't really had the chance to try many radically new things lately.  My focus has been on getting through school and managing my relationships, which leaves little room for major experimentation.  I suppose starting college itself was a big change, but it felt more like a necessary step than a deliberate exploration of something unknown. I'm more focused on what I know right now.","Honestly, staying on track with my studies and responsibilities feels like a constant uphill battle. I make to-do lists, but they often end up feeling overwhelming.  I struggle to prioritize tasks effectively and frequently get sidetracked by worries about the future or my boyfriend.  The most rewarding part is the occasional sense of accomplishment when I manage to complete a significant assignment; however, more often than not, the sheer volume of things I ""should"" be doing feels more overwhelming than rewarding.","Social interaction can be exhausting. Seeing my boyfriend in person is a highlight, but even then, my anxiety can sometimes dampen the experience.  Larger social gatherings drain my energy; I find myself retreating inward and needing quiet time to recharge afterward.  I prefer close relationships over large, lively groups.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I often internalize it, rather than voicing my opinion directly. I don't enjoy confrontation and prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.","The essay pretty much sums it up.  Feeling overwhelmed by school, my relationship, and the uncertainty of the future is my default state.  My initial response to stress is often anxiety and exhaustion.

While I haven't employed any highly structured time management system, I've generally managed to keep up.  The challenge has been balancing the required reading with my desire for free time, which I sometimes prioritize.","Going home this weekend is something I am looking forward to.  Being with my family and friends energizes me;  I get to relax and just ""be"" without the pressures of college.  Conversely, the somewhat strained social dynamics in my dorm are draining. They are polite but not friendly, a situation I find perplexing and slightly upsetting.","I disagree with my roommate Ashley sometimes due to her immature behavior. I handle it by tolerating it since she is much better than someone who would be entirely unfriendly. I prioritize maintaining a peaceful living situation and finding common ground, even if it means enduring some irritating behavior.","When I feel stressed, like when overwhelmed with college work or when considering my less-than-ideal social life, I tend to internalize it.

I often find myself distracted by my anxieties and loneliness.  I attempt to use planners and to-do lists, but often fail to stick to them.  The most rewarding aspect is when I *do* manage a task and experience a fleeting sense of accomplishment, but it’s a battle.","A large party or group setting often leaves me feeling drained rather than energized. I much prefer one-on-one interactions, where I can truly connect with someone without the overwhelming stimulation of a crowd. This preference has reaffirmed that I'm more introverted than I might like to admit, despite my desire for companionship.","Disagreements can be difficult. I tend to avoid confrontation, even if I strongly disagree with someone.  My priority is maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising my own views. This is definitely an area for self-improvement.","My anxieties often manifest as rumination, focusing on my weight, lack of a girlfriend, and academic performance.  To cope, I work out excessively, but my eating habits are erratic.  Seeking professional help might be beneficial, but that feels like another intimidating hurdle to overcome.",y,n,y,n,y
915,I don't often seek out new experiences; I tend to stick to what's familiar and comfortable.  My free time is largely spent listening to music and allowing my thoughts to drift rather than actively pursuing novel activities. This essay itself is a testament to how I'd rather sit and passively listen to music than actively generate new ideas.,"I manage my time and resources in a fairly unstructured way.  Meeting deadlines is sometimes a challenge; this essay, for example, was a last-minute scramble.  I prioritize immediate needs and tasks as they pop into my head, but I struggle to maintain a long-term plan or consistently stay on top of everything. The feeling of having so many things to do made me feel slightly overwhelmed.",Social interactions generally leave me feeling drained. I prefer the company of a few close friends and find large gatherings overwhelming. My tendency to drift into my own thoughts and listen to music rather than engage in social interactions reflects this preference. Spending a day at the mall with others created a draining experience.,Disagreements are usually handled by avoiding direct conflict.  I tend to internalize conflicts rather than engaging in confrontational discussion. The essay writing process was a form of internal conflict between wanting to complete the task and wanting to listen to music.,"Stress and anxiety manifest as a sort of mental blankness and an increased tendency to focus on whatever music is nearby. The essay itself highlights my response to such feelings by simply describing my feelings without attempting to analyze or resolve the anxiety, this process simply highlights my anxieties and avoidance mechanisms.",n,y,n,n,y
916,"I'm always drawn to learning new things, though I often feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of possibilities.  While I haven't had a singular defining ""new experience,"" the ongoing pursuit of knowledge – whether it’s delving into religious texts, learning an instrument, or attempting to understand the complexities of relationships – is a constant motivator.  The feeling afterward is a mixture of satisfaction and the immediate realization of how much more there is to learn, which then fuels my desire to start the next project.","My life feels like a constant juggling act; goals are numerous, and sustained effort feels like a monumental task.  Time management isn't my strength; I often find myself pulled in multiple directions, struggling to prioritize.  I'll start one project then get distracted by another, never fully completing any. While I value the potential for achievement, the sheer volume of things I want to accomplish often leads to feelings of being overwhelmed and ultimately, inaction.","Social interactions are a double-edged sword.  Spending time with friends, especially in spontaneous settings, can be fun, but afterwards the need to be alone to recharge kicks in.  Large gatherings or sustained social engagement leave me feeling depleted. I recognize that I need solitude to process my thoughts and emotions, so I try to carefully manage social time to avoid becoming overwhelmed.","Disagreements are challenging, and my preference is usually to avoid direct conflict. However, I'll sometimes find myself needing to assert my needs or perspective, which I do quietly and thoughtfully, often focusing on understanding the other person's point of view before expressing my own.  Reaching a compromise or simply acknowledging differing opinions feels like a better way to resolve conflict than intense debate.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions. My mind races with a million things at once, often leading to feelings of being overwhelmed. I sometimes try to manage it by diving into a project, losing myself in work or the pursuit of knowledge, but this is often just a distraction from the core issue of my overwhelmed state.  Real relaxation feels impossible.",y,n,n,y,n
917,"I recently got a haircut that was drastically different from my usual style. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, driven mostly by a desire for change and a feeling that my old look wasn't quite representing me anymore.  Afterwards, I felt a bit shocked but ultimately positive about the change, although the essay reveals some lingering uncertainty about my self-presentation.  It was certainly outside my comfort zone.","While the essay shows many plans and to-dos,  it also shows a lack of consistent follow-through.  I often identify goals — like exercising, practicing guitar, or doing schoolwork — but my approach to achieving them is somewhat disorganized and inconsistent.  Challenges frequently lead to procrastination rather than focused effort and structured planning, which I acknowledge as a weakness. The reward is the feeling of finally completing a task.","Social interactions are a mixed bag.  Spending time with my friend energized me, as evidenced by my excitement at hearing from them. However, the essay also highlights my dislike for crowded, chaotic environments like grocery stores and the overwhelming feeling of being surrounded by ""sheep"" in a college setting. These scenarios seem to reflect a preference for quieter, more intimate interactions.","The essay doesn't directly showcase conflict resolution, but my feelings about ""dumb people"" and general annoyance suggest I might not always prioritize maintaining harmony. I seem more focused on expressing my own opinions, even if it means being critical or blunt.  The essay is largely a stream of consciousness expressing dissatisfaction.","The essay is filled with expressions of stress and anxiety related to school, work, and daily life.  I express many sources of frustration and irritation. My initial response to stress seems to be to complain or worry and not necessarily to implement structured stress-reducing techniques. The essay reveals a tendency to dwell on frustrations and annoyances.",y,n,n,y,n
918,"I wouldn't say I've ever done anything truly ""out there,"" but I did register for an online sweepstakes.  It was impulsive, a bit of a lark, motivated by the sheer unlikelihood of winning.  Afterwards, it didn't really change anything; I just went back to my routine.","My biggest challenge was getting my textbooks from Varsity Books at the best price.  I spent quite a bit of time comparing prices, waiting for sales, and eventually tracking down the cheapest options. Although it involved a good bit of work, this approach was rewarding since it saved money and it really made me feel organized.","Talking to my suite mates about bathroom schedules was energizing.  It felt good to connect with people in my new dorm, build a sense of community, and sort out practical matters together. It reinforced my preference for friendly, collaborative interactions.","My roommate is talking to me about having her boyfriend stay over Labor Day.  I am prioritizing being accommodating and offering a place for him to stay, because I’ve only known her for 5 days, and it would be great to establish a good relationship with her and her boyfriend.","Having my wisdom teeth out was stressful, but I just sort of ignored the pain. I didn’t even take the prescribed medication, and I don’t think my reaction was entirely healthy. While I have an amazing tolerance for pain, it really would have been better for me to seek help in dealing with the stress and discomfort.",n,n,y,y,y
919,"Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer sticking to what I know.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone usually fills me with more anxiety than excitement.  School starting again was new in a way but, that was more about a renewed routine than a novel experience.","I thrive on structure and routine.  To stay on track with goals, I create detailed schedules and checklists. I prioritize tasks and break them down into smaller, manageable steps.  It's challenging when unexpected events disrupt my plans, but I try my best to adapt and refocus. The reward is a sense of accomplishment when I achieve what I set out to do.  The essay reflects that I'm working on scheduling my life better so there is less time stress.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to.  I get my energy from quiet time and reflection rather than constant social stimulation.  The essay expresses loneliness and I think that is tied to my introverted preferences.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid conflict, sometimes even at the expense of voicing my own opinions.  My priority is maintaining harmony and relationships, even if it means compromising on my personal preferences. The anger towards my stepmother in the essay demonstrates that despite this tendency, I do have a breaking point.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions. My initial response is often to retreat and overthink things, leading to a cycle of worry.  I am trying to develop better coping mechanisms like exercise (as mentioned in the essay), but I haven’t quite mastered them yet.  The many expressions of stress and anxiety in the essay reflect my tendency toward neuroticism.",n,y,n,n,y
920,"I wouldn't say I'm one for wildly experimental activities.  My essay mentions struggling with a new computer ethernet card – that was far from enjoyable! I prefer the familiar, sticking to what I know works and avoids unnecessary stress. The idea of trying something completely new doesn't particularly appeal to me; I'd rather focus on mastering what's already in front of me.","Getting my AP credit transferred was a major goal that required persistence.  I meticulously followed the instructions, even going to the Measures and Evaluations building in person when the online system failed. While initially frustrated by the technical difficulties, I persevered because the credit is essential for my academic plan. This experience highlighted the importance of diligence and resourcefulness in achieving my goals.  The rewarding part was finally getting it done.","Large social gatherings drain me.  My essay shows I prefer smaller, close-knit interactions with my family and close friends.  Spending time with them is fulfilling because of the genuine connection, understanding and support.  Large groups feel overwhelming and unnecessary to me; I find them draining rather than energizing.  My preference leans towards quiet, intimate connections.","I strive to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.  While my brother's blunt honesty can sometimes be challenging, I appreciate his directness.  The essay highlights how I value honesty, even if it's delivered in a way that differs from the more indirect approaches I may take. Resolving conflicts involves finding common ground and maintaining respect, even when we strongly disagree.","The essay recounts a time when the new ethernet card malfunctioned and caused me immense stress to the point of tears. I responded to this initial stress by crying, which helped release some of the emotional pressure. After that, I systematically worked toward solutions, focusing on what I could control, which ultimately helped ease the anxiety.  Taking direct action and seeking practical solutions helps me manage these feelings.",n,y,n,y,n
921,"I'm always looking for new experiences.  Dyeing my entire body purple was definitely one of those moments – impulsive, maybe a little crazy, but ultimately something I don't regret.  The motivation was pure spontaneity; I just felt like doing it. Afterwards, I felt a rush, a sense of liberation from the ordinary.  It was a bold statement, really.","Setting and achieving goals isn't really my strong suit. I'm more of a go-with-the-flow type. The essay shows how I flit between different activities and thoughts without much structure. I rarely think things through strategically; my actions are usually driven by immediate impulses or feelings.  Perhaps focusing on a single goal would be challenging, but rewarding in the long run.","Being around lots of people, especially at a place like Stars, can be incredibly energizing.  The shared excitement and energy are contagious and fill me with a sense of connection.  However, other times, too much social interaction drains me.  I need time alone to recharge. I think this highlights my need for balance between social interaction and solitary time.","Disagreements happen, and I try to approach them with a focus on understanding the other person's perspective.  I value maintaining relationships, so I usually try to find common ground and resolve conflicts peacefully. While I might express my own opinions honestly, I prioritize empathy and compromise to keep things harmonious.","Stress and anxiety are definitely familiar feelings to me. My initial response is often a mix of overwhelmedness and slight panic, followed by the need to find a way to distract myself – whether through activities or just shutting down. I tend to cope with stress by seeking out comfort in others, but perhaps prioritizing more structured coping mechanisms would be beneficial.",y,n,y,y,y
922,"I love trying new things!  Just recently, I went to a ballet class, something I've always wanted to do but haven't had the opportunity for.  The motivation was pure longing – I missed the feeling of dancing.  It was exhilarating and surprisingly challenging, but afterward, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment and a renewed sense of self.","I'm working on finishing my college degree, which requires careful planning and time management.  To stay on track, I create detailed schedules, breaking down big assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. Staying committed is tough sometimes; procrastination is a real struggle. But breaking down tasks and rewarding myself for completing them keeps me motivated.  The rewarding part is the progress I make towards graduation. The biggest challenge is balancing school with my social life and other obligations.","A recent trip to New York energized me immensely. Spending time with friends, seeing Broadway shows, and exploring the city filled my social tank. I thrive in environments with stimulating social interaction and lots of energy. The interactions were fulfilling due to the shared enthusiasm and connection I felt with my friends.  It solidified my preference for extroverted social activities and relationships.","I recently had a disagreement with someone about a project we were working on together. I prioritized finding a compromise that worked for both of us, even if it meant sacrificing some of my own ideas. Listening to their concerns and explaining my perspective calmly were key. Resolving the conflict smoothly felt good; maintaining a positive working relationship was my highest priority.","I get stressed easily, particularly when dealing with multiple deadlines. Initially, I tend to panic. To cope, I take deep breaths, make a to-do list to prioritize tasks, and try to break them down into smaller, less overwhelming steps.  Focusing on what I *can* control and reminding myself of my progress helps calm my anxiety.",y,y,y,y,n
923,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  While I haven't explicitly stated it, the essay shows I tend to stick to what I know and am comfortable with.  The whole exercise of writing this essay was an ordeal I only endured because I had to. My thoughts are often described as confused, but there is not an attempt to explore those thoughts and make sense of them.","I’m surprisingly conscientious, despite my tendency towards procrastination, as evidenced by my completing this assignment.  I managed my time poorly in the past, exemplified by my procrastination of this writing assignment, which I know has a deadline, and it's something that worries me.  However, I value doing things the right way; cheating is wrong to me, even when faced with academic pressure. I find challenges frustrating at times but pushing through them rewarding because that's what you do, and that is what's expected of you.","I value social interactions, but I also enjoy solitude, as my feelings about the writing assignment and the thought of it being read shows.  Energetic social situations can be draining, especially if there is an expectation to be social, such as this assignment or a class of 500 students. While I write about valuing friendship and connection with others, my deep anxieties show that I don't handle social pressure very well.","I generally try to be agreeable, as shown by my belief that most people are good. However, the betrayal by my friend Tiffany caused me significant pain and impacted my trust in others.  My approach to conflict is often avoidance, yet I am not necessarily passive. When someone challenges me I will try to reason with them and seek common ground.","I experience high levels of anxiety and stress, as evident in my writing. The essay is evidence of my inner turmoil and self-doubt. I often turn inward when stressed, as seen in my depression after the betrayal in my relationship with Tiffany. However, I also use coping mechanisms like pretending to be strong, as my example of Omar shows.  The assignment is both a form of stress relief and a painful reminder of my shortcomings.",n,y,y,y,y
924,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  I stick to what I know and what's comfortable, like going to my regular aerobics class. While I initially felt some apprehension about the timed writing assignment, it wasn't something I actively chose.  The overall experience was, shall we say, not particularly enjoyable.","I'm motivated by external pressures, like maintaining my figure and avoiding the ""freshman 15"". To stay on track with this goal (going to aerobics), I rely on the structure provided by the class schedule itself. While I sometimes feel stressed about it, the social pressure from my hometown keeps me coming back. The reward is the feeling of avoiding unwanted attention for gaining weight. It is certainly challenging to balance my other commitments, but the fear of gaining weight outweighs the challenges.","The email from my friend Travis was a really energizing social experience.  It was a brief interaction, but made me feel happy and connected. The energy was definitely positive.  Conversely, this writing assignment, and being disturbed by my friend, were extremely draining. My preferences are certainly more towards short bursts of interaction with close friends, rather than prolonged engagement with unfamiliar or intrusive people.","I dislike rudeness, especially from those providing a service. I tend to keep my opinions to myself rather than directly confronting the rude computer station lady.  My priority is avoiding conflict and maintaining a comfortable environment.  I prioritize peace and harmony over confrontation.","The timed writing assignment stressed me out. I felt anxious about completing it on time and meeting expectations. My initial response was to focus on the time left and to keep writing regardless of quality.  My coping mechanism was focusing on the fact it would soon end, providing relief from my anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n
925,"I’m not one for wildly experimental activities, preferring the familiar and comfortable. However, I did try reading Chaucer’s *Canterbury Tales* in the original Middle English. While initially daunting, I felt a sense of accomplishment in attempting something challenging, even if it was hard to comprehend.  The experience taught me the value of perseverance and the importance of finding resources to assist understanding complex concepts, in this case a modern translation.","My main goal this semester is securing a 4.0 GPA to get into UT's College of Business. I'm aware I need to study rigorously to achieve this. However, the essay shows my time management is inconsistent; I prioritize socializing over studying. Instead of a structured study plan, I rely on sporadic bursts of effort and seeking help when needed (like tutoring). While I aim for success, I don't have a rigid system for achieving it. The challenge is balancing my social life with academics, and the reward would be the self-satisfaction of giving my best effort, regardless of the outcome.","A recent social experience that energized me was planning a fun outing for a friend visiting from out of town.  Connecting with friends, especially one I value and haven’t seen for a while, fills me with energy and enhances my mood. In contrast, situations that involve many acquaintances or superficial interactions leave me feeling drained. I enjoy close relationships with those I trust and that are mutually enjoyable for us.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, but they occasionally happen. I try to approach them by listening to the other person’s perspective, understanding their concerns and making sure I am also clear in my own perspective. Sometimes, I'll compromise or find a solution that works for both of us. While I value having friendly interactions with others, I don’t prioritize keeping peace at all costs; stating my view is important.","The pressure of needing a 4.0 GPA to get into business school and the stress of struggling with *Canterbury Tales* leave me anxious. My initial response is to procrastinate and distract myself by focusing on my social life.  However, I eventually realize that I need to buckle down and study. Seeking help with calculus, for example, demonstrates an attempt to manage the situation constructively. My anxiety sometimes manifests as a fear of failure and the need for external validation of my efforts.",y,n,y,n,y
926,"Discovering Pink Floyd's music was a completely new experience for me.  I was motivated by curiosity, and the smooth sounds and evocative lyrics, particularly the ""fishbowl"" analogy resonated deeply, inspiring a sense of longing and ambition. The experience left me feeling relaxed yet introspective, prompting deeper thoughts about my own life and desires.","My goal of maintaining abstinence from drugs and alcohol required consistent self-discipline. I prioritized avoiding situations where substances were prevalent and focused on alternative activities like attending parties (though rarely invited) to stay on track.  The challenging part was missing out on social events where others used drugs or alcohol, but the rewarding aspect was the pride in my commitment to my values.","The disco party was a memorable social experience, yet somewhat draining.  While I enjoyed dancing and having fun, observing others needing alcohol to socialize highlighted my preference for sober interactions. This reinforced my understanding that I'm not energized by large, boisterous gatherings, but rather by quieter, more meaningful connections.","I haven't described a direct disagreement, but my observation of others’ reliance on alcohol to socialize implied a difference in values.  My priority was not to confront their behavior, but to maintain my own standards and understand their motivations, which I interpreted as lacking self-esteem.","I don't explicitly describe feeling stressed or anxious in my essay, but the underlying themes of loneliness (""fishbowl"" analogy) and feeling excluded from social activities hint at underlying feelings of inadequacy and perhaps low self-esteem, which I attempt to compensate for by adhering to strong moral principles and self-control regarding substance use.",y,y,n,y,n
927,"I’m not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The essay pretty much sums it up – I’m more comfortable sticking to what I know. I guess the closest thing to trying something new was hanging out with Mike last night; he rarely leaves his apartment, so it was a bit unusual. It wasn't exactly thrilling, but it wasn't bad either.","Goals?  Sustained effort?  Ha!  My essay speaks for itself.  I’m terrible at planning and following through. I always leave things until the last minute. I *intended* to be more organized this year, but it's not happening.  The only thing I consistently do is procrastinate.","Spending time with Mike last night was an interesting experience.  While I appreciate the company, social interactions, even with someone I like, often leave me feeling drained. I prefer my own company, frankly.  It's less draining.  I don't really crave large social gatherings.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep quiet or just go along with them to avoid an argument.  It's easier to just let things go than to confront someone, especially when the energy needed for a social interaction is something I try to avoid. My priority is maintaining peace.","I get stressed pretty easily. My initial response is to procrastinate—and the essay illustrates that quite well.  To manage it, I usually try to distract myself or just avoid dealing with whatever's causing the stress until absolutely necessary.  I don't have any particularly good coping mechanisms.",y,n,n,y,n
928,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  My essay shows I prefer the familiar, and even my decision to go to college probably stemmed more from a sense of obligation and expectation than a burning desire for something radically different. That said, I did choose to pursue a Spanish major, which was a new academic direction, but even then, it was more a continuation of an interest than a leap into the unknown.","I struggle with consistently following through on goals that demand sustained effort. My essay makes it clear that procrastination is a major issue for me, especially when it comes to studying. I try to create schedules and utilize resources like planners, but I rarely stick to them due to my inherent laziness.  I don’t manage my time or resources effectively. The rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when I do complete something. The challenging part is consistently motivating myself to start.","I enjoy being around people but I do find that large social gatherings or extended periods of socializing can leave me feeling exhausted.  My essay mentions being annoyed with my roommate and a friend, which reflects my need for alone time to recharge. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to; these social experiences are the most energizing.  The essay hints at needing to avoid overwhelming social situations.","Disagreements are often uncomfortable for me. My tendency, as reflected in my essay, is to avoid direct conflict, even if it means compromising my own preferences.  I often prioritize maintaining harmony, which sometimes means I don't fully express my feelings. This might result in me passive-aggressively feeling annoyed, which is not a healthy coping mechanism. I need to improve my ability to assertively handle disagreements.","I experience significant anxiety, especially around uncertainty.  My essay clearly illustrates my fear of the unknown, which manifests as anxiety about school, future plans, and even potentially living situations.  My initial response to stress is often worry and sometimes panic. To manage it, I sometimes turn to faith and prayer, as shown by my reference to being Christian, but clearly faith alone doesn't always resolve my anxiety. I need to actively work on developing more effective coping mechanisms.",n,n,y,n,n
929,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out wildly new experiences, but I did try playing a Primus-influenced metal song with my band.  It was a departure from our usual pop-punk and it pushed me outside my comfort zone musically. While the experience itself wasn't the best performance-wise, the attempt to diversify our sound was something I felt pretty good about afterward.","I'm not exactly a master planner.  Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my forte.  I did try to balance my band and a part-time job, but it didn't work well. My priorities were frequently misplaced, and I often prioritized the immediate thrill of playing a show over other responsibilities. I regret not managing my time better.","Large, energetic crowds at our better shows are definitely energizing.  The connection with the audience, the shared excitement, that feeling of being completely present in the moment – it’s an amazing rush.  Conversely, quieter, smaller gatherings, or if things aren't going well onstage, leave me feeling drained and kind of deflated. I definitely need that burst of intense shared experience to really feel ""up"".","Disagreements are handled in a way that doesn't necessarily prioritize harmony.  My dad's anger after I left the moving job early for a show isn't something I really grappled with extensively; I just felt restless and my reaction was to leave home.  I don't always prioritize the feelings of others, especially when other things are more important to me.","Feeling stressed or anxious is a frequent experience, especially when I'm juggling multiple responsibilities, which is always. My initial response is usually to avoid or minimize the issue and to seek immediate gratification like playing a show, even if it's not the best idea. Sometimes I’ll retreat to my room and avoid interacting with others until I feel better.",y,n,n,y,n
930,"I decided to take a creative writing class, despite my usual aversion to anything remotely structured.  I was motivated by a desire to express myself in a new way, and to challenge my cynical, negative mindset. While the experience was sometimes frustrating, the creative freedom felt liberating.","Getting a high GRE score was a huge goal, demanding consistent studying over several months.  I used a strict schedule, employing the Princeton Review materials rigorously. Although setbacks—like my computer crashing—were frequent, my intense desire for a high score (and intense anxiety about not achieving it) kept me going.  The challenging part was maintaining discipline, but the potential payoff made it worthwhile.","Large social gatherings, especially those filled with superficial interactions, often leave me drained.  The constant noise and forced pleasantries are exhausting.  Conversely, intimate conversations with close friends or deep engagement with a stimulating topic are far more rewarding.  My preference for solitary activities is clear; I value quality over quantity in relationships.","I tend to avoid confrontation, often swallowing my frustrations rather than directly addressing disagreements. In conflicts, my priority is to de-escalate the situation quickly, even if it means compromising my own views.  This approach minimizes discomfort, but sometimes feels unsatisfactory in the long run.","When overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw and express negativity, as seen in my writing. While initially I might become irritable and cynical, I actively try to manage my anxiety by focusing on tasks.  The strategy of forcing myself to accomplish small steps helps to calm my nerves and gain some control over my feelings.",y,y,n,n,y
931,"I've always been fascinated by the human mind, its complexities and mysteries.  This interest led me to take a class on the Rise of Christianity, which, while challenging some of my beliefs, ultimately reinforced the inexplicable impact of faith in my own life.  Exploring these complex ideas, even ones that contradict my own, feels exciting and enriching, though sometimes it leads to a bit of an existential spiral.","Planning my weekends to see everyone I miss back home is important to me, though I'm not always super organized about it.  I strive to maintain these relationships, recognizing their importance. While I try my best, I sometimes get sidetracked by my own thoughts and feelings;  procrastination is definitely a weakness, and my workouts sometimes get pushed aside because of it.","Spending time with people I deeply connect with, like my friends and family back home, is extremely energizing.  The familiar comfort and shared history make for a fulfilling experience. Conversely, navigating new social situations or superficial interactions at college can feel draining, highlighting my preference for close, meaningful relationships over large, casual gatherings.","I'm generally agreeable, but I've found myself in disagreements, especially in my Christianity class.  My approach is to listen carefully to differing perspectives, even if I don't agree.  While I value maintaining positive relationships, I also prioritize honesty and expressing my own beliefs respectfully, even when they differ.","Missing home and my close relationships can trigger feelings of anxiety. To cope, I write down my thoughts and feelings, helping me process them.

I created a detailed study schedule, utilizing time management apps and seeking out tutoring when needed. Sticking to my plan was challenging, especially during stressful times, but seeing my grades improve kept me motivated.  The biggest reward was the feeling of accomplishment.","A recent party with my dormmates was absolutely draining. The loud noise and constant social interaction left me feeling exhausted and overwhelmed.  It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings where I can have meaningful conversations rather than superficial interactions.","I had a significant disagreement with my roommate, Carrie, about my crying spells.  I prioritized understanding her perspective, while also explaining the challenges of adjusting to college life.  While we didn't fully resolve it, we reached a better understanding and agreed to be more patient with each other.","When I first moved to Austin and started college, my anxiety became overwhelming.

I suppose searching for the right fish across multiple pet stores demonstrated a level of persistence, but I wasn't exactly exploring uncharted territories.  The whole process felt more like a task than an adventure.","Getting the new fish was a goal that certainly required some planning and effort.  I meticulously researched the fish and the process of introducing them to an existing tank. I even drove all over Austin to find the right ones. However, I clearly failed to follow through with the proper acclimation procedure.  The rewarding part was finding the fish, but the ultimate outcome wasn't successful due to my oversight.","Going fish shopping with my boyfriend was energizing.  His playful teasing and our shared search for the perfect fish created a positive social experience.  The collaborative aspect made it fun and enjoyable. While I can be outgoing at times, I prefer the company of close relationships and shared activities to more chaotic, large group interactions.","The conflict with my fish clearly highlighted my lack of agreeableness. When my old fish began attacking the new ones, I acted decisively rather than finding a solution to co-exist. I prioritized the welfare of my new fish over the life of my old one, and rather than attempt peaceful resolution I chose a quick, albeit drastic, solution.","Dealing with the death of the fish and my past experiences working at the hospital was quite stressful. My initial reaction was to find a practical solution – the immediate removal of the fish from the tank.

Things tend to happen, or not, without much planning from me.  I find structure and long-term commitments incredibly difficult. The idea of managing resources and staying on track causes me significant stress.","Social situations generally exhaust me. Crowds and prolonged interactions drain my energy. I prefer to be alone, and even small talk feels like a chore.

I tend to withdraw or become sarcastic and dismissive, though I’m aware of my rudeness.  My priority is usually to just end the interaction and avoid further conflict. I struggle to see other people's points of view.","I feel anxious and stressed very often. My initial response is usually irritability and anger.  To cope, I usually withdraw and try to avoid thinking about it, which, obviously, does not help.  I rarely actively take steps to manage my emotions constructively.",y,n,n,n,y
935,"I’m always open to trying new things, even if they initially seem daunting.  For example, I impulsively signed up for a college course in calculus—even though it’s notoriously difficult for me. Although my initial motivation was a bit impulsive, the experience has pushed me outside my comfort zone, and although I hate it, the challenge makes me feel strangely alive.","I struggle with consistent, long-term goals.  My approach to challenges like finishing my calculus homework is often last-minute and chaotic. I’m more likely to cram than to diligently study. The rewarding part is the sense of accomplishment when I somehow manage to get things done, even if it’s often at the last possible moment.  Staying committed is the biggest challenge; procrastination is a constant battle.","Social situations are generally draining for me.  Large gatherings, even with friends, often leave me feeling depleted and longing for solitude. I find smaller, more intimate interactions more fulfilling. My preference for quiet time influences my choices; I avoid overwhelming environments and prioritize time to recharge.","Disagreements are handled with a mix of avoidance and emotional intensity.  I tend to internalize conflict rather than directly confronting the issue at hand, which isn't always the healthiest approach.  My priority is maintaining relationships, sometimes even at the expense of expressing my own needs and opinions.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  When overwhelmed, I tend to panic and spiral into negative thoughts—as seen in my erratic and intense essay. I might try to escape the stress through distractions but also sometimes attempt constructive strategies like talking to friends or searching for solutions, although I am often inconsistent with this.",y,n,n,y,y
936,"I’m not really one for trying new things, honestly.  The only thing I can think of that was even slightly new was going to that Chick-fil-A in the union. Even then, it wasn't *that* different, and I ended up disappointed because my coupon didn't work.  It just made me feel frustrated and like I'd wasted my time.","I'm pretty conscientious, I think. Finishing this assignment is a good example. Even though I’m tired and sleepy, and it’s taking longer than I expected, I’m sticking with it until the end. I manage my time by just plowing through it, even if it's slow.  I find it rewarding to complete things, even if the process is a little tedious.","Social experiences usually drain me. Going to the union with my friend was kind of like that. It was overpriced and disappointing, which didn't help. I guess quiet time alone is more my speed.  I need a lot of downtime to recharge after being around people.","I have a really hard time disagreeing with people. My relationship with Stephen is complicated and full of unspoken things. He is passive, but thinks he's in control. I find it frustrating. I don't confront the issues, because I'm avoidant of conflict.  It's easier to just go along to get along, even if I don't agree.","I get stressed and anxious really easily. Today, the Chick-fil-A coupon not working and the long assignment are making me pretty stressed.  My initial response is to just get sleepy and tired. To manage it, I keep working on the assignment, hoping to finish soon. I avoid dwelling on the negative things too much, so I get distracted by other things.",n,y,n,n,y
937,"I don't naturally gravitate towards new experiences.  However, recently, I've felt empowered by a newfound faith to try things outside my comfort zone.  This assignment itself is a prime example; while I wouldn't typically seek out such activities, a spiritual push led me to participate, and I actually found it quite enjoyable, despite my initial hesitations.","I'm currently striving to balance the demands of college life with my spiritual life.  Time management is a challenge, but I've begun using a planner and setting daily goals to stay organized. While I occasionally find myself distracted by anxieties, my commitment to faith helps me to refocus and persevere through difficulties. The rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when I meet my goals and maintain my spiritual practices.","Social situations tend to drain me.  Large gatherings, especially, leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with those I trust. This essay, though a solitary activity, provided me with a sense of thoughtful engagement and expression, which is more fulfilling to me than engaging with a large group of people.","Disagreements are handled best when approached with humility.  While my initial instinct is to avoid confrontation, I try to listen to others' perspectives and communicate my own point calmly and respectfully. My priority is mutual understanding, even if it means compromising on my own views. It is best to seek out Truth and to recognize one's own biases rather than become entrenched in an argument.","Stress and anxiety often manifest as feelings of loneliness and uncertainty about the future, particularly concerning college.  I find solace and comfort in prayer and faith. Invoking the name of Jesus helps to calm my nerves and provide a sense of peace and stability amid the anxieties of life.  I also find that writing and journaling help me process my feelings more clearly.",n,y,n,n,y
938,"I joined Air Force ROTC, which was a completely new experience for me.  I was motivated by the potential for scholarships and a career path, but also by a desire for structure and challenge.  Although the physical training is tough, I've found aspects of it rewarding, and I'm excited about the possibilities of this path.","My goal is to excel in Air Force ROTC, which requires dedication to physical training and academics. I'm creating a workout schedule to manage my time effectively, prioritizing workouts in the mornings and using evenings for studying. While sleep deprivation sometimes interferes with my plans, the desire to succeed motivates me to stay committed.  The biggest challenge is balancing fitness with studies and sleep, but the potential rewards are worth the effort.","I find large social gatherings draining. The ROTC PT test, where I was surrounded by many people, left me feeling exhausted.  The interactions felt more obligatory than fulfilling, and this experience solidified my preference for smaller, more intimate social circles, or interactions that provide some degree of familiarity.","When my roommates stay up late, and I have to wake up early for ROTC, it irritates me.  I try to be understanding since they aren't intentionally disruptive; however, my need for sufficient sleep takes priority, and this conflict highlights my need for quiet time and consistency in sleep. I'm looking forward to living on my own next year.","The physical demands of the ROTC PT test caused a lot of stress, culminating in my throwing up after the run. This intense physical strain heightened my anxiety, but I addressed it by focusing on my training goals, acknowledging the need for better pacing in the future. Overall, my initial reaction of physical distress was overtaken by a determination to improve my performance.",y,y,n,y,n
939,"I'm always up for trying new things, especially if it involves music or exploring a new place.  Discovering Portishead’s live music was a total revelation;  the raw energy was unlike anything I'd heard before. It completely changed my perception of live music and inspired me to seek out similar experiences. That's why I'm really excited to check out the live music scene downtown Austin.","I struggle with managing time and sticking to goals.  Balancing 16 hours of classes, especially ones with lots of reading, with my social life and desire to get exercise, is difficult. While I know exercise benefits me, I often prioritize other things, even though I acknowledge this is detrimental to my well-being and academic goals. This essay itself proves my lack of planning and commitment to the task at hand.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. I find myself recharging after spending time alone.  The thought of a crowded concert energizes me, but being amongst a crowd for an extended period of time would likely cause me to become overwhelmed and exhausted.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If disagreement arises, I'll attempt to understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it.  Maintaining positive relationships is really important to me; I'd much rather find common ground than engage in prolonged arguments.","When I get stressed, I tend to withdraw.  Lack of sleep exacerbates this feeling, leaving me exhausted and unmotivated. I know exercise helps, but sometimes the thought of it is too overwhelming, reflecting my tendency to procrastinate and avoid tasks, even beneficial ones.",y,n,n,y,n
940,"I haven't really tried anything super new lately.  My life is pretty full with school and my social life.  I guess maybe trying to figure out how to navigate the post office was a little out of my comfort zone, but that was more stressful than exciting. I'm not really a big risk-taker in terms of experiences.","Getting through college is my biggest goal right now. I try to stay on top of my readings, but sometimes I fall behind, especially when I’m really busy with friends. I rely on planners and to-do lists, and I set mini-deadlines for myself.  It's challenging to balance everything but incredibly rewarding to see my progress.  Although, maybe I’m not as organized as I should be; I forgot to change my contact lenses.","Going out with my friends always energizes me. I thrive in social situations.  Spending time talking and laughing with people I enjoy is the most fulfilling thing.  Sometimes though, when I’m stressed, even that can drain me. I think it comes down to being around supportive and positive people.","I try to be agreeable but sometimes I get really upset with people, like my mom.  Usually, I try to calmly explain my perspective, but sometimes I need space to cool off before things get worse.  Compromise is important to me, even though I may be a bit self-absorbed in some situations.","I get stressed easily, especially with school.  When it hits, my immediate reaction is to feel overwhelmed and complain. I know I'm a responsible person, but I often forget things or procrastinate.  To cope, I usually reach out to my friends or let off steam with some activity. I also need to work on better organizational habits.",n,y,y,y,y
941,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty happy sticking to what I know.  Trying new things feels risky and makes me anxious.  Honestly, the thought of doing something completely different fills me with dread rather than excitement.  I prefer routine and familiarity.","I'm not naturally organized or disciplined.  I have goals, like doing well in my classes, but keeping up with everything feels overwhelming and stressful.  I often fall behind and struggle to prioritize tasks effectively; getting started and staying focused are major hurdles for me.   My microeconomics class is a perfect example of this struggle.","Going out with my floormates to Olive Garden was a really good time.  Being around people who are friendly and accepting is energizing.  High school was really isolating, so I cherish this sense of belonging and the opportunity to connect with people. Making these friendships has given me a much-needed boost.","I usually try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep quiet, rather than confront the situation.  Direct confrontation makes me anxious, and honestly, sometimes I just don’t care enough to engage. It's easier to let things go than to rock the boat.","This cold is driving me crazy!  The anxiety about missing tubing with my friends is making me even sicker. I’m a worrier in general and this whole situation is making me feel overwhelmed and helpless.  My frustration is actually making the sickness worse, I think.",n,n,y,n,y
942,"Coming to UT and being surrounded by such a diverse student body was a completely new environment for me.  I was initially overwhelmed by the sheer size and variety of people, but it motivated me to step outside my comfort zone.  While initially daunting, the experience ultimately led to a greater appreciation for different perspectives and a broader understanding of the world.","Balancing academics with social life at UT was a major goal that demanded consistent effort.  I didn't have any particularly structured time management system, but I did make sure to prioritize important assignments and tried to balance my responsibilities by taking regular breaks and pursuing social interactions in moderation.  The challenge was finding time for everything, but the reward was the opportunity to learn and grow both personally and academically.","Most social experiences at UT initially left me feeling drained. The sheer volume of interactions and the pressure to immediately form connections, while others did so effortlessly, were overwhelming.  This made me realize my introverted nature and my preference for smaller, more meaningful connections as opposed to large social gatherings.","I haven't described a specific disagreement in the essay, but my tendency is to avoid direct conflict.  I prioritize maintaining peace and understanding, seeking compromise over winning an argument. I focus on listening to other perspectives, even if I don't agree, to better understand their point of view.","The transition to college life caused me considerable stress and anxiety.  My initial response was to worry excessively about classes and assignments, leading to feelings of loneliness.  To manage my emotions, I found solace in activities such as listening to music, playing games with friends, and taking walks. Engaging in these calming and productive activities helped distract me from my anxieties and gradually reduce the overwhelming feelings.",y,n,n,y,y
943,"I'm not really one for trying new things, honestly.  I stick to what I know and what's comfortable.  The one exception might be agreeing to go on that date dash last night – even though I’m usually intimidated by attractive guys. It was kind of fun, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a life-altering experience.","I'm definitely not the most organized person. My essay is a prime example.  I have a million things running through my head (books to buy, classes to read for, etc.), but actually getting them done... well, that's another story. I frequently forget things. Using a planner or something like that would help, I'm sure.","Last night's date dash was energizing.  It was fun to dance and get to know someone new and cute.  I usually feel awkward and self-conscious around good looking people, but Jordan was easy to talk to, which boosted my confidence. Even though he left me hanging, his remorse seems genuine, so I'm not that upset. It's given me a new level of confidence when it comes to social interactions.","I'm not always the best at handling disagreements.  I want the conflict resolved swiftly, prioritizing the other person's feelings and my own need to maintain a positive relationship.  I know my ex is going through a lot so I've tried to be supportive of him while also trying to distance myself after a break up.","This whole paper-writing experience is incredibly stressful! My computer crashed, I'm dealing with the pressure of school, and my ex is in the hospital. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and panicked, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time.  I will focus on finishing this paper to help reduce my stress load and then I will try to visit my ex.",n,n,y,n,n
944,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to radically new experiences.  While I enjoy the familiar comfort of routine, there are times when I'm open to trying new things if they seem interesting, or if they are presented within a familiar context like going to a high school football game again even though I'm older now.  Ultimately, though, I find the greatest joy in the memories and experiences associated with my friends and family, things I already know and love.","I struggle with staying on track with long-term goals, as my essay shows. I often find myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks, as seen in my comment about my homework assignments.  While I recognize the importance of keeping up with my reading,  procrastination is a constant battle.  I might have good intentions, but maintaining focus and discipline over time is a challenge for me.","The high school football game was a really energizing social experience.  Being surrounded by the familiar atmosphere and excitement, and seeing my brother play, was exhilarating. The energy of the crowd and the shared experience created a really positive and uplifting feeling. I thrive in social situations like that, ones that are fun and involve people I know well.  It made me realize how important those connections are to my overall well-being.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  When disagreements arise, I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony and good relationships.  I would probably try to find common ground and work towards a compromise, emphasizing mutual understanding and respect.  Direct confrontation isn't my preferred method;  I'd rather find a way to resolve things amicably.","I experience stress and anxiety fairly frequently, and my feelings about my upcoming birthday and the amount of homework I have showcase that. My initial response is often a sense of overwhelm, a feeling of being bombarded by responsibilities, as I stated with all the reading assignments I had.  To cope, I tend to focus on immediate, concrete actions—like putting on warm slippers when my feet are cold or eating grapes to satisfy a craving—to distract myself, and to create a sense of control in a stressful situation.",n,n,y,y,y

For instance, writing papers is always a last-minute endeavor.  I usually manage by cramming, but it’s stressful and rarely leads to my best work.  I admire organized people, but I find it incredibly challenging to stay focused.","Large social gatherings can be both energizing and draining.  A recent hula party was fantastic—the music, dancing, and laughter were infectious.  However, being surrounded by too many unfamiliar people can sometimes leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I value intimate interactions with close friends.","I can be quite headstrong, and disagreements often arise.  My approach to resolving conflict is to be direct but to try and understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree. My priority is clear communication but I'm not always effective in practice.","Stress and anxiety are familiar feelings for me.  I get overwhelmed easily. I usually respond by shutting down, sometimes by overthinking. I am slowly learning to manage my anxiety by taking breaks, talking to someone who understands, and doing relaxing things to quiet my mind and help me cope.",y,n,y,n,y
946,"I'm not someone who readily jumps into unfamiliar situations.  The essay reflects my hesitancy to explore new ideas or activities; I tend to stick to what's comfortable. While I'm open to new concepts intellectually, actively pursuing them is a different story.  This assignment itself felt like a leap into the unknown, and the process was challenging.","I often struggle with procrastination, as evidenced by my delay in completing this assignment.  While I do set goals, my approach to meeting them is inconsistent. I lack the structured planning and consistent effort needed for long-term projects. My initial impulse is to avoid challenges, leading to self-imposed ""writer's block.""  However, once I overcome the initial inertia, I can push through.","Social interactions are sometimes energizing, but more often, they leave me feeling drained.  I prefer the company of close friends or online connections. Large gatherings or unfamiliar social settings make me anxious. The essay reveals my inclination toward introspection rather than outward social activity.  I recharge by spending time alone.","I tend to avoid conflict and prefer harmony. If disagreements arise, I prioritize maintaining a peaceful relationship.  My approach is to try and understand the other person's perspective.  I'm not likely to be assertive in expressing my own viewpoint if it might lead to conflict.  This isn't necessarily a sign of weakness but rather a preference for avoiding confrontation.","Procrastination and self-doubt are common responses to stressful situations like this assignment.  My initial reaction is anxiety and avoidance. However, I do find ways to manage these feelings, such as taking breaks and reframing the task to make it less daunting.

It’ll be interesting to see if it lives up to the hype. I guess afterward I'll either be feeling sore or exhilarated.","Honestly, I struggle to stay on top of things.  I signed up for a bunch of clubs, which sounds great on paper but realistically makes scheduling difficult. My calculus homework keeps piling up, and I have to balance that with reading for my classes.  Time management isn't exactly my strong suit.","I'm not really a big social butterfly; last night's bowling was fun for a bit, but by 1 AM, I was ready to go home. Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy more than they energize me, which is why I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions. This Vietnamese restaurant outing with a few dorm mates sounds more my speed.","I haven’t really had any major disagreements lately; my main priority when conflicts arise is usually to just avoid them, and that's what I'm likely to do if and when a conflict happens.  I am not a person who likes confrontations, so I tend to keep my opinions to myself if they go against the group's plans.","I'm feeling pretty chill right now, but I get stressed easily when things pile up, such as when my homework is overdue or when the multiple club meetings clash. I suppose my go-to response is to just procrastinate, which eventually builds more stress, creating a cycle.  The best solution is to find a way to efficiently manage my time, even though I struggle with doing that.",y,n,n,n,n

The motivation stemmed from a deep interest in psychiatry, a career path I hadn't considered until recently.

I utilize detailed planners and try to prioritize tasks, although my recent trip home disrupted my schedule.  Despite setbacks, I'm determined to stay on track by consistently reviewing material, even if it means late nights. I find the challenge rewarding but also quite stressful at times.","I find large social gatherings draining; I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  The funeral of my friend was emotionally taxing, highlighting my need for quieter moments to recharge after social events.

I'm eager to explore psychology, music, and making new friends, even if dorm food leaves much to be desired.","Balancing my desire to be in wind ensemble and orchestra with my academic workload, plus maintaining a long-distance relationship with Thorin and keeping in touch with friends and family, has definitely required sustained effort.  I'm trying to create a study schedule, but I still struggle with time management. My commitment to my relationships and my goals are my biggest motivators, and the challenge is finding time for everything.","Meeting new people energizes me, especially fellow musicians. The bassoon party sounds fun; being around others who share my interests makes me feel connected and understood. However, large social events can leave me drained. I value close relationships and meaningful interactions more than huge parties, which explains my preference for smaller get-togethers.","I prioritize maintaining positive relationships even in disagreements. When conflict arises, like my issues with Denis, I try to understand their perspective.  While I felt deeply hurt and betrayed, I'm working through it.  Forgiveness is important, even if it's difficult.

Setting up my own computer was probably the closest I've come to trying something completely new recently – mostly because it involved a lot of technical steps I wasn't familiar with.  It felt rewarding to successfully complete the setup, and I gained confidence from the achievement, proving I'm capable of figuring things out on my own.","I'm generally pretty good at setting and achieving goals, although I sometimes procrastinate, as evidenced by starting this essay late.  With my classes, I tend to prioritize assignments based on difficulty and deadline. Time management isn’t always my forte, which is why I found myself needing to cram for this.

It reinforced my preference for being surrounded by like-minded people who share common interests.","I haven't explicitly described a conflict in my essay but it's evident I prioritize maintaining relationships. I value my friendships and seem sensitive to others' feelings, even those I've only mentioned briefly. Therefore, any disagreements would likely be handled with careful consideration of others' perspectives. I tend to avoid direct conflict.","My essay reveals a lot of anxiety. The tryout and the constant thoughts about the concert show an underlying anxiety.  The physical symptoms, like eye strain and the general feeling of discomfort, reflect my tendency to experience stress and worry. I handle this by focusing on the things I enjoy, like my favorite band.",n,y,n,y,y

Afterward, I felt a mix of excitement and accomplishment, a good balance. It's helped me step outside my comfort zone in a positive way.","My goal of succeeding in college required careful time management. I prioritize tasks, using planners and to-do lists. Challenges included balancing band practice and my coursework, but sticking to my schedule and seeking help when needed kept me on track.  The rewarding part has been the sense of accomplishment in balancing everything.","A memorable social experience was moving into the dorm and meeting my roommate.  It was energizing because we already knew each other which made connecting easy. This experience solidified my preference for spending time with close friends, people I already feel a connection with.",Disagreements with friends or family are usually navigated through open communication. My priority is understanding their perspective and finding a solution. I'll attempt to compromise and maintain a positive relationship.,"Feeling stressed usually comes up when thinking about being away from my girlfriend.

957,"I'm drawn to new experiences, although the essay doesn't detail a specific instance of trying something completely new. My move to a new place, as described in the essay, represents a significant change and a leap into the unknown, driven by a desire for something more and a dissatisfaction with my current situation.  The anticipation and uncertainty are exciting, even if tinged with anxiety about the unknown future. I'm eager to embrace whatever challenges and opportunities await me.","The essay reveals my ambition to reach a six-figure income by age 30. This goal demonstrates a level of planning and foresight. While the essay doesn't detail the specific strategies, the mention of research and investing suggests a proactive and organized approach.  The dissatisfaction with my current job, despite its financial benefits, hints at a strong work ethic and a drive for self-improvement.","The essay reveals an introspective nature, preferring deep connections rather than large social gatherings. Although I crave excitement and connection with someone who mirrors my restless spirit, the overall tone suggests a preference for close relationships over large, bustling social scenes.  The essay indicates a need for deep, meaningful connections, suggesting that superficial interactions might leave me feeling unfulfilled.","My anger towards the person who harmed Amber, and my self-reproach for not acting sooner, demonstrates a strong moral compass and concern for others' well-being. However,  my lack of direct confrontation shows a hesitancy to conflict. I prefer to process my feelings internally before addressing any disagreements; direct confrontation isn't my preferred method, but my concern for Amber shows that I care about others, even if my actions don't always reflect that immediately.","The essay reveals a significant amount of anxiety and self-doubt, particularly concerning my purpose and future.  My restless nature and anxieties about my career and financial situation, coupled with my self-reflection on past mistakes (regarding Amber), show signs of anxiety. While I use self-reflection as a coping mechanism, the essay reveals underlying anxieties, even if I try to maintain a positive outlook.",y,y,n,n,n

I prefer things I already know and understand. I'm more focused on completing my to-do list than exploring new territory.","I'm incredibly focused on accomplishing my goals, even if it means sacrificing some things.  I create detailed to-do lists and meticulously manage my time, using planners and reminders.  While sometimes overwhelming, this structured approach is essential to keeping up with my responsibilities at school and in my social life. The challenge is finding enough time; the reward is the sense of accomplishment when I check things off my list.","Large social gatherings usually drain my energy; I find them overwhelming. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  Memorable social experiences tend to be those where I can connect meaningfully with a few people without the pressure of constant interaction. Overwhelming situations, like large sorority meetings, leave me feeling exhausted and needing a lot of alone time to recharge.","I usually prioritize maintaining harmony in disagreements, attempting to understand the other person's perspective. Even when frustrated, I try to find common ground. I believe in open communication, but I’m not afraid to stand my ground if my own needs or priorities are severely disregarded. Although my frustration may build if the disagreement is prolonged.","Stress and anxiety are common for me, usually stemming from feeling overwhelmed by my responsibilities. My initial reaction is often to become overwhelmed and disorganized. However, I try to manage my feelings by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and seeking support from friends.  I also use coping mechanisms, like exercise (like my seven-minute abs routine!), to help calm down and focus on the next thing I need to do.",n,y,n,y,y
959,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  My thoughts are mostly consumed by my longing for home and my dance career. The idea of sex keeps popping into my head, probably because it’s an unknown, but even that isn't a priority right now.  I crave familiar comforts and the things that bring me joy like my dog and my brother, not exploring new experiences.","I'm committed to finishing college, even though I don't particularly enjoy it right now. I'm managing my time by completing my emails and whatever schoolwork is absolutely necessary, but my focus is on planning my dance studio. My commitment is there, but it's mostly driven by a sense of obligation rather than burning passion for academics.","Social interactions generally drain me right now.  Being away from my support system and my dance students is isolating.  I'm more introverted, preferring the company of my dog and close friends over large groups.  This experience highlights my need for familiar and comforting relationships to recharge.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  Although my boyfriend sometimes upset me, I mostly just miss him.  I prioritize maintaining relationships and avoiding confrontation, even if it means compromising my own needs or desires, which makes me feel drained.","I'm feeling incredibly stressed and anxious about being away from home and my dance career.

960,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""completely new,"" but starting college at UT was a huge shift for me.  Going from a tiny private school to massive lecture halls was a real adjustment, but I was motivated by the chance to learn and grow independently.  It's been surprisingly good – despite the homesickness,  the independence is exciting, even if a little scary.","Getting ready for my chemistry and medical terminology quizzes this week required a lot of consistent studying. I planned my study time carefully, making sure to spread it out and focus on the most challenging concepts first. This helped a lot. While I felt anxious about the tests,  the feeling was manageable, and I felt prepared thanks to my efforts.  The reward of feeling ready for exams is definitely worth the hard work.","Spending Friday night out with my boyfriend was energizing. Being with him is always fun, and I appreciate his efforts to support me during this adjustment.  Conversely, last week, being torn between my family and boyfriend left me feeling drained and stressed. This experience reinforced that my time with loved ones needs to be balanced.","The disagreement with my mom about spending time with my boyfriend was tough.  I prioritized open communication. I explained my feelings honestly, emphasizing that I care deeply about both of them. Her apology and understanding were great, and it reminded me how important honest communication is in resolving conflict and strengthening relationships.","The first week of college was really stressful and anxiety-inducing, dealing with homesickness and the change of environment. I mostly just focused on my studies to distract myself, as well as keeping in close contact with my boyfriend and family. It helped knowing my support system was there for me. Talking to my boyfriend every night eased my homesickness.",y,y,y,y,y
961,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately, mostly sticking to what I know and enjoy.  The essay reflects that I’m more focused on balancing my current commitments. The only mildly ""new"" thing mentioned was the online submission of the essay itself, and while I found it convenient, it wasn't something that pushed my boundaries or significantly changed my perspectives. I'm content with my routine for now.","Balancing my sorority commitments, classes, social life, and family time definitely requires serious planning and organization.  I use planners and to-do lists to stay on track, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance.  While it can be challenging, especially with unexpected events, the reward of having everything in order and still having time for fun makes it worthwhile. This is apparent in how I manage a busy social life with a full academic load.","Being in my sorority is incredibly energizing. The genuine connections I share with the other girls provide a sense of belonging and support.  However, maintaining this while keeping my academic commitments in check can feel a little draining sometimes. I know my social preferences lean towards large groups and shared activities, so being in a sorority is clearly satisfying despite the demands.","I try to resolve disagreements with understanding and compromise. Since I describe myself as easily going along with the flow, I strive to find solutions that satisfy everyone involved as much as possible. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, but that doesn’t mean I avoid stating my own opinions.","While I have a lot on my plate, stress doesn't generally overwhelm me. I tend to approach challenging situations with a proactive mindset, focusing on what I *can* control.

Reading it felt like a break from the required reading, something I actively chose to engage with because it resonated with my own uncertainty. This experience reminded me that exploring different perspectives and narratives, even fictional ones, can be incredibly valuable and insightful.","I struggle with setting and maintaining goals that require sustained effort.  School feels overwhelmingly time-consuming and frustrating, making it hard to stay on track. My time management is poor.  I often find myself distracted and procrastinating, leading to stress and frustration. The reward of finishing assignments is often outweighed by the immediate relief of doing something else.","Spending time with my friends in Clarksville, having beers and BBQ, energizes me. The relaxed atmosphere and shared interests make for fulfilling social interaction. On the other hand,  I find most people uninteresting and draining, making large social gatherings unpleasant and leaving me feeling depleted.  I generally prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I know and trust.","I often disagree with people, particularly those I consider unintelligent. I tend to keep these disagreements to myself rather than engaging in conflict. I prioritize avoiding social interaction over resolving the conflict directly. While I may not voice my disapproval, my frustration and negative feelings remain.","School, smoking, and worries about my future and relationships stress me out tremendously. My initial response is usually anger and frustration.  I try to manage this by smoking, which clearly is a counterproductive coping mechanism. I wish I could eliminate stress entirely, but I haven't found a consistently effective method yet.",y,n,n,n,n
963,"I haven't actively sought out drastically new experiences, preferring the familiar comforts of routine.  Moving away from home and starting a life independently was a significant change, but it was a long-anticipated and self-driven step rather than a spontaneous leap into the unknown. While I’m navigating new things like finding a church in a new city, I generally prefer established routines and structures.","Balancing my studies, work, and personal life requires significant organization and prioritization.  I create to-do lists and deadlines,  breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.   Staying committed is sometimes challenging, particularly when overwhelmed, but prioritizing my responsibilities and rewarding myself when I complete goals helps immensely. Procrastination is a struggle but I usually manage to stay on track.","Large social gatherings often drain me. I much prefer small, intimate settings with close friends. This move to Austin has been isolating in a way. While I value my independence, I miss the constant interaction and easy camaraderie I had at home. I’m finding it challenging to build the same connections here and this is affecting my social needs.","I generally prioritize maintaining positive relationships, even during disagreements. I try to understand the other person's perspective and communicate openly and honestly, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution. While I can be assertive when necessary, my goal is to find common ground rather than to win an argument. My preference is to cooperate for a peaceful resolution.","Stress and anxiety manifest as feelings of overwhelm and self-doubt. My initial response is often to retreat and overthink, but I am trying to develop healthier coping mechanisms. Creating lists, prioritizing tasks and talking to close friends and family have been helpful in managing these feelings and focusing on a more constructive approach.",n,y,n,y,y
964,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new, but college itself is a big change.  Moving away from my familiar high school environment and diving into such a diverse university was a leap. I was motivated by the hope of finding people like me and a better social scene than I had back home. So far, it feels more comfortable than high school, even though I'm still a little shy.","I haven't really tackled any long-term goals yet besides graduating college with an engineering degree.  My time management isn't the greatest right now, to be honest.  I want to join a bunch of clubs, which could impact my studies. But the reward of an engineering degree is the major motivator. I guess I'll figure out the time management later.","Going to college is energizing. I'm meeting new people, even though I'm a bit shy. The university environment feels more welcoming than high school.  I love that there are so many ways to connect with others, and I hope to be involved in sororities and multicultural events.  Being around other people gives me energy, even though I’m still a bit nervous about talking to them.","I'm not really good at disagreements. With my family, I often avoid voicing my feelings rather than addressing conflicts. But my boyfriend helps me handle those situations a lot better than I do on my own. I prefer not to argue, I mostly just go with the flow.","I don't usually get stressed or anxious. I'm pretty content with my life and my family situation. I find my comfort in my support systems (family, boyfriend). Even though I have a lot of plans for college, it is exciting more than stressful.

This helps me process my complex emotions and explore different ways of thinking about my situation. The idea of learning piano, something completely new to me, excites me because it connects to my desire for a future with Michael.","Balancing my demanding business school coursework with my intense homesickness has been challenging. I've tried to stay organized, prioritizing assignments and dedicating specific times to studying.  However, my emotional state often impacts my focus; I find myself longing for home, and that often affects my ability to maintain a strict schedule.  The rewarding aspect is the prestige of the school and the hope it offers for a better future.","Meeting new people in Austin leaves me feeling drained.  While I appreciate their attempts at friendship,  the lack of a deep connection, particularly the absence of Michael, makes social interactions feel superficial and unfulfilling. My preference is clearly for close, intimate relationships rather than large social gatherings.","I haven't had many significant disagreements here in Austin. I try to be agreeable, mostly because I'm already struggling emotionally and don't want to add conflict to the mix. With Michael, disagreements are rare due to his understanding nature.  My priority is maintaining harmony in relationships that provide emotional support, especially given my current isolation.","My homesickness and the distance from Michael cause immense stress and anxiety. I initially respond with crying and feeling overwhelmed by sadness. To cope, I write poetry and focus on my academic goals, seeing them as a path towards a future where I can be with him.  The thought of a potentially long period of unhappiness is very scary but I'm trying to stay positive.",n,y,y,y,n
966,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to trying radically new things.  My trip home to Huntsville was more of a return to the familiar, a comfort rather than a venture into the unknown.  While I did experience a wide range of emotions, it wasn't driven by novelty but by the bittersweet reunion and subsequent goodbye.","I'm not someone who meticulously plans every detail; I'm more spontaneous. However, the decision to move away from Huntsville was carefully considered. While I didn't rigidly track my progress, I prioritized what mattered most: maintaining my relationship with my family and friends before I moved and keeping those relationships as best I could since the move, even though distance makes it a challenge. I didn't create schedules or use trackers.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining.  My time back in Huntsville was overwhelmingly positive, reconnecting with loved ones, particularly my girlfriend and my family.  It fueled me, it gave me comfort, and the happiness from those reunions made the draining goodbye much harder, but the interactions were very fulfilling because of my relationships with those people. However, large, loud groups can be too much.","Disagreements aren't something I particularly enjoy. I tend to avoid conflict, especially if it could damage my relationships, even if that requires me to sacrifice my position.  During my trip home, I focused on cherishing the moments with everyone. I did not prioritize ""winning"" any conflicts. This was particularly evident when I spent an hour with my girlfriend and didn't argue, despite the heartache of the breakup.","I tend to handle stress and anxiety with a degree of emotional honesty.  The goodbye was incredibly difficult; I cried a lot.  Instead of suppressing my feelings, I allowed myself to experience the sadness and pain.

I've found the whole experience interesting and surprisingly fulfilling.","I'm not the most organized person, to be honest.  Setting and achieving long-term goals is something I struggle with. I tend to get sidetracked easily.  While I have big aspirations, my approach is more organic. I often start something with great enthusiasm but my follow-through can be inconsistent.  It's something I'm working on!","Large, loud social gatherings often leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with people on a deeper level.  Deep conversations and meaningful connections are far more energizing for me than superficial interactions with lots of people.

I prioritize open communication and finding a solution that works for everyone involved, even if it means compromising my own position.  I like peace and harmony.","When I get stressed or anxious, I tend to become withdrawn and introspective. I need time alone to process my emotions.

I prioritized tasks and allocated specific time blocks to ensure completion. While the late start to my day was a setback, I focused on efficiently completing the remaining tasks. I found the sense of accomplishment rewarding, but managing my time effectively was challenging.",Spending time with my friends Sara and Whitney to sort out our housing situation was an energizing social experience.  The collaborative problem-solving and shared excitement about finding a place together boosted my mood. It reinforced my enjoyment of teamwork and shared experiences with close friends.,"When the apartment we initially wanted was taken, we were upset, but I prioritized finding a solution that benefited everyone involved.  Instead of dwelling on the initial disappointment, we adapted and found a larger apartment with additional roommates, leading to a cheaper rent. I focused on compromise and collaboration to resolve the conflict peacefully.","My initial reaction to screwing up in my relationship with Ed was intense anxiety and fear.

I try to schedule everything meticulously, using planners and to-do lists.  It's a constant juggle, and sometimes I fall behind, but I prioritize what’s most important at the moment. The reward is the sense of accomplishment when I successfully navigate my busy schedule.  The challenge is learning to say no sometimes and prioritize my own needs for rest and self-care.","The mixers with my pledge sisters are generally energizing – I love meeting new people and building connections.  However, when I'm feeling unwell, even positive social interaction can be draining.  It's made me realize the importance of balancing social time with alone time to recharge. I need both social engagement and solitary reflection to thrive.","I find it hard to say no to my pledge sisters and feel a strong desire to be accommodating, even when it strains my own needs. I try to communicate my feelings honestly but diplomatically to avoid hurting anyone's feelings.

The motivation was simply necessity, and afterward, I felt mostly frustrated and overwhelmed.","I'm definitely not a naturally organized person. Goals?  Yeah, I set them, but following through is a different story.  I usually rely on sheer panic to get things done—like this assignment, which I started at 2 AM because I procrastinated.  I tend to let things pile up until I’m forced to deal with them, which is pretty stressful. It’s also rewarding to finally finish something, even if it’s at the last minute.","Talking to Derek on the phone is my favorite social interaction.  It energizes me; it’s easy, and he’s always fun to chat with.  I’m definitely more comfortable with one-on-one interactions than large groups, and I really value those close relationships that feel comfortable and easy.  I get drained by social situations that feel superficial, forced, or involve lots of people.","Disagreements aren’t my favorite thing.  I usually try to avoid them. If I *do* find myself disagreeing with someone, I will often just go along with it to avoid conflict.  My priority is usually to keep things peaceful and maintain the relationship, even if it means compromising my own views. It’s easier that way.","Stress and anxiety are definitely a big part of my life.  The initial response is usually procrastination and avoidance.

The experience has been incredibly rewarding, helping me manage my anxiety and express myself creatively; it’s become a daily routine, which is a big change from only playing once a week.","Balancing my coursework with my music and relationship has been a struggle.  I don't have the best time management skills, and sometimes I procrastinate on assignments, especially calculus. While I try to prioritize my tasks, I sometimes get sidetracked, and then I end up rushing to finish things last minute.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed. I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings, like one-on-one interactions.  My current girlfriend is quite outgoing, and our relationship is important to me, but I don't thrive in larger groups and find them exhausting.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I often try to find common ground or simply let things go rather than confront the issue head-on.

972,"I’m not someone who actively seeks out new experiences. I prefer familiarity and comfort.  While I haven’t had many dramatically “new” experiences, moving away from home for college was a change, though I ended up staying at home.  It was motivated by the desire for independence, but ultimately, the familiarity of home felt more comfortable than the unknown. I’m not sure I’d call it a success or failure; it was just…a thing.","I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven or organized. Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't my forte.  I can get bogged down in indecision and self-doubt.  For example, choosing a major is something that’s been very challenging for me, causing a lot of internal conflict and stress as I weigh potential careers and their impact on my future.  I haven’t really had to strategize to stick to a plan; if it doesn't come naturally, it's not likely to happen.","Social situations are generally draining for me.  Large gatherings or forced interactions leave me feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well. Even those, I need to be in the right mood for.  I would describe myself as a quiet person, preferring to observe rather than participate in lively conversations.

If I disagree with someone, I'm likely to internalize it rather than voice my opinion directly. It may sound passive, but conflict avoidance is simply how I handle these situations. It is easier to avoid conflict and remain pleasant than deal with the discomfort of an argument. My priority is maintaining peace, even if it means suppressing my own views.","Stress and anxiety are familiar feelings. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw and overthink things.  I don't necessarily handle stress constructively, but I try to cope through self-reflection rather than active problem-solving.  I tend to analyze my feelings and the situation, hoping to understand why I feel this way. I don’t necessarily seek solutions immediately, often letting things work themselves out.",y,n,n,n,n

Afterward, it was a good laugh, but it didn't change my overall preference for familiar activities.","I'm pretty organized and get things done, usually ahead of time.  For instance, I always try to plan my studying and social events to avoid conflict and keep on track with schoolwork.  When I missed that Kinesiology assignment, I was pretty upset with myself! I use planners and to-do lists to stay organized and generally manage my time effectively, but sometimes my social life interferes. I find the balance between socializing and schoolwork challenging, but rewarding when I manage it successfully.","Going to the hypnotism show and then hanging with the Delts really energized me.  Being around people I enjoy is awesome! I thrive on social interaction, it gives me more energy, especially with my close friends and sorority sisters.  Conversely, spending too much time alone can leave me feeling somewhat drained. These experiences reinforce that I'm definitely an extrovert.","I generally get along with people, but of course, there are disagreements. If I'm in a disagreement, I try to understand where the other person is coming from and find common ground. My priority is to maintain positive relationships, even when we don't completely agree.  I avoid confrontation and try to communicate openly and respectfully to resolve conflict.","My knee problems definitely stress me out!  Initially, I get anxious and worried, but I try to deal with it constructively by making appointments with my doctor and focusing on the steps to manage the issue.  I focus on what I can control, like going to physical therapy. Sometimes, though, anxiety gets the best of me.

This stream-of-consciousness writing assignment was a bit outside my usual comfort zone, but it felt strangely cathartic in the end.","I definitely struggle with balancing everything on my plate – work, school, and household chores.  I try to create a basic schedule, but it often gets thrown off.  This weekend’s town picnic is a welcome distraction, but even there I'll likely feel a tug of guilt for things left undone. That said, I *do* try to prioritize tasks, and I find that breaking larger goals into smaller, manageable steps makes it less overwhelming.","The UT football game, despite the heat, was incredibly energizing. Being surrounded by the enthusiastic fans, the collective energy of the crowd, and the shared sense of school pride was exhilarating.  I thrive in those kinds of high-energy social situations.  Quiet evenings at home, on the other hand, can feel draining, even if I enjoy the solitude.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll often internalize it rather than confront them. For example, while I have too much Longhorn gear and feel guilty about buying more, I still keep doing it.  I value harmony and would rather avoid friction if possible, which might not always be the most productive approach.","Feeling overwhelmed by my to-do list is a common experience. It causes me to feel tired and stressed.  My initial response is usually avoidance – I’ll check my email or do something else to procrastinate.

Recently, I started learning calligraphy, something entirely new and different from my usual pursuits. It was a way to explore a different creative outlet and channel my fascination with these periods into a tangible skill. I found the process surprisingly calming and rewarding, a nice contrast to my often anxious feelings.","While I'm not the most organized person, I do set goals.  For example, I've been trying to improve my writing. I haven't been very consistent, relying on bursts of inspiration rather than a structured plan. My procrastination is often fueled by a fear of failure or a feeling of being overwhelmed.  While I struggle to maintain a schedule, the moments when I do sit down and write are quite rewarding, although fleeting.","Going to crowded social events can be incredibly draining.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings or one-on-one interactions with people I feel comfortable with.

This reinforces my preference for deeper connections rather than superficial interactions with many people.","I tend to avoid direct conflict whenever possible. When disagreements arise, I often internalize my feelings rather than confronting the other person head-on, which occasionally leads to unresolved issues. I often prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising my own desires.  Ultimately, I value harmony but need to learn more assertive communication skills.","The recent rejection on a date left me feeling incredibly anxious and down. My initial response was self-doubt and a spiral of negative thoughts about myself. To cope, I turned to writing; expressing my feelings helped, although I'm not sure it really resolves the underlying issues.  I know I need better coping mechanisms, but emotional processing is hard for me.",y,n,y,n,y

I wasn't sure at first, but it turned out to be a surprisingly positive experience—though I mostly focused on just meeting new people to be friends.","Balancing my studies and maintaining a relationship with Jenny has been a challenge. I try to prioritize my assignments, but sometimes my thoughts drift to her.  It's a constant juggling act; I don’t use any specific time management techniques, but I manage to get things done eventually.  The rewarding part is seeing Jenny this weekend – definitely worth the effort!","Being around my college friends is often energizing; it’s fun, lots of laughs.  Conversely, large crowded social events can drain me.  I value deep connections and enjoy one-on-one or small group interactions more. I prefer intimate settings and quality time with people I'm close to.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, especially with close friends and family members. I tend to try and smooth things over; I don't want to make waves, but I do speak my mind when necessary.   My priority is maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising sometimes.","When I get overwhelmed with schoolwork and anxieties about Jenny, I usually just want to spend time with her.  I get anxious, which is then often alleviated by interacting with my girlfriend. It helps just to focus on her and escape my stress, worries, and work for a short time.",y,y,y,n,y
977,"I tried learning Japanese calligraphy once.  A friend introduced it, and the intricate detail and artistic expression intrigued me.  I found the process relaxing but challenging, and while I wouldn't call myself proficient, I enjoyed the experience and might revisit it.","I struggle with consistently meeting deadlines.  My calculus homework, for instance, was completed late because of procrastination. I tend to rely on last-minute bursts of effort and the assistance of others rather than structured planning.  This is something I find both challenging and frustrating.","Most social situations drain me.  The few exceptions are when I'm with close friends, jamming music together.  These experiences are energizing because they involve shared passion and minimal pressure for superficial interaction. Large gatherings or forced small talk leave me feeling depleted.","I often avoid direct confrontation.  If I disagree with someone, I'll likely express my opinion subtly or simply withdraw from the discussion. I prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising on my own views.  Direct conflict feels uncomfortable and draining.","Stress and anxiety manifest as procrastination and avoidance. When overwhelmed, I tend to distract myself with music or the internet. While this isn't the healthiest coping mechanism, it's my usual response, and I'm working on finding better ways to manage my emotions.",y,n,n,y,y
978,"I’m not one for drastically changing things up. I value consistency and familiarity.  While I appreciate music and art, I'm not someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences; I prefer the comfort of the familiar. The thought of trying something entirely new makes me feel uneasy, even though I recognize the potential value in such experiences.","I’m quite conscientious, actually.  I value having a close group of friends, and maintaining those relationships requires consistent effort.  I prioritize quality over quantity, carefully nurturing those ten friendships I have.  I find this rewarding, even though it means rejecting the idea of expanding my social circle widely.  The challenge lies in balancing my desire for deep connections with the occasional discomfort of social interaction.","Social situations, particularly large or unfamiliar ones, tend to drain me.  I find energy in deep connections with a small group of people I trust.  Large gatherings or interactions with strangers leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. This preference has shaped my understanding of my need for intimate, meaningful relationships over superficial acquaintances.","Disagreements can be uncomfortable, especially because I avoid conflict. I prefer to maintain harmony within my close circle. If a disagreement arises, I would try to understand the other person's perspective first, finding common ground to resolve it peacefully and maintain the friendship rather than winning the argument.","I experience stress and anxiety, often stemming from the uncertainty of life and social situations. My initial response is to withdraw and overthink, and I can feel overwhelmed. To manage these emotions, I focus on spending time with trusted friends and reflect on the situation in a quiet moment, focusing on how to handle it constructively from a calm place in my mind.",y,y,n,n,y
979,"Taking my medical terminology class was a completely new experience for me.  Although I've always been interested in psychology, applying it to the medical field was daunting at first. However, the challenge motivated me to learn, and I felt a sense of accomplishment after successfully completing the class. The experience broadened my understanding of the field and how I might apply my psychology interest.","Balancing my college courses, maintaining my relationship with my boyfriend, and helping my family were some of my goals which required sustained effort.  I tend to prioritize things as they come up rather than develop an elaborate schedule. Though sometimes this leads to some last-minute rushing and feeling overwhelmed, I find that my flexibility helps me adapt to unexpected events and still manage to get things done.  The constant juggling was rewarding in that I learned how to effectively manage my time.","Going home to see my boyfriend Jovan always energizes me.  I value the close relationships I have with my family and boyfriend.  The time I spend with him makes me happy and allows me to relax, reducing the stress that can come with studying and college life.  My need for closeness with my loved ones helps me thrive.","My mom and I have been arguing lately. I tried to remain calm and listen to her perspective, then explain how her words were making me feel. Although resolving these conflicts hasn't always been easy, I prioritize maintaining a healthy relationship with her and communicating openly, even if it means accepting we may not always agree.","The assault on my brother when I was younger caused me a lot of stress and anxiety.  Initially, I responded by feeling frightened and confused, seeking help from my school counselor.  She taught me coping mechanisms, helping me process the trauma and develop strategies to manage future anxiety-provoking situations.  Her support helped me move forward and helped cultivate my passion for psychology and therapy.",y,n,y,n,y

The only time I really tried something new recently was switching to full-fat vitamin D milk—my roommate suggested it, and it’s actually pretty good. I wouldn’t say it changed my life, though.","I’m not the most organized person.  I haven’t really set any long-term goals that required sustained effort. I mean, I guess getting through college is one, but I'm mostly just taking it day by day. I don’t have any special time management techniques, honestly.",Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions with people I already know well. My roommate from high school has made this transition much easier; having someone familiar helps.  Energetic social situations just feel overwhelming.,"I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just keep quiet unless it's something really important. I prioritize maintaining harmony and would rather not rock the boat.  I figure it's easier to just go with the flow.","When I’m stressed, like after the Texas Longhorns lost, I tend to withdraw a little.  I might sleep in or just focus on something I enjoy like watching a Cowboys game.  I don't usually do anything active to cope; I'm pretty low-key about it.",n,n,n,y,n
981,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences.  My focus has been intensely on school and navigating my new independence, leaving little time for experimentation. The most ""new"" thing I've done recently was moving to Austin for college, but even that was driven by a desire for independence, not a thirst for novelty.","Honestly, my goal of succeeding in college has been a constant struggle. I haven't developed any sophisticated time-management techniques; I just worry obsessively about my grades.  It's less strategic planning and more driven by intense anxiety. The reward is the hope of proving myself, but the constant worry is incredibly draining.","Meeting my new boyfriend in Austin was energizing initially.  The excitement and novelty of a new relationship were thrilling.  However, my fear of missing out and tendency to be guarded quickly soured this. Interactions can become draining when fueled by insecurity and suspicion.  I crave social connection but struggle to trust people completely.","I find conflict very difficult.  In disagreements, my priority is to avoid direct confrontation. I usually try to be nice, even if I harbor resentment, because I'm worried about burning bridges.  This stems from a fear of losing support in this new, independent phase of my life.","I'm constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about my future and relationships. My initial reaction is usually to worry incessantly, which only exacerbates my anxiety.  I haven't found effective coping mechanisms yet; my worry is more of a default setting than a deliberate strategy.",n,n,y,n,y
982,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person.  While I joined a choir at UT, which was new, my motivation was more about the social aspect and the enjoyment of singing than a desire to radically change my life. Afterwards, it felt good; a welcome distraction from the stresses of university life and a potential way to meet new people, especially someone like Maryann.","I definitely struggle with sustained effort.  The writing assignment itself highlights this; I found it hard to focus for even 20 minutes.  I often procrastinate and only get things done when absolutely necessary.  The choir is probably the closest thing I have to a long-term commitment, but even then, I'm more driven by immediate enjoyment rather than a structured plan.","The choir audition and my anticipation of meeting people there represent a positive social experience. I’m looking forward to making friends and meeting new people. On the other hand, the thought of being alone on weekends fills me with a sense of loneliness and isolation. This emphasizes my need for social interaction and connection.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  My frustration with Aaron's behavior shows how I internalize negative emotions rather than confronting the person directly.  In the case of Aaron and Bernie's situation,  I'm more upset on Bernie's behalf than I am motivated to engage with Aaron about his actions.","This whole writing assignment has made me feel anxious.  My initial reaction was avoidance, and I struggled to focus.  However, the act of writing about my feelings and anxieties, even in a disorganized way, helped me process and manage my emotional state.  The excitement over the choir and other positive aspects of my life helped counteract these feelings.",n,n,n,y,y
983,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I tend to stick to what I know.  The essay reflects this—my thoughts are largely centered on familiar routines and concerns. While I mention liking the quotes in my psychology book, that’s more about appreciating familiar forms of expression than actively exploring new ideas.  Trying something completely new just doesn't often occur to me.","I’m generally pretty organized and focused on my goals, even if my approach isn't always perfectly structured.  The essay shows I’m aware of my responsibilities (studying, reading, working) and I make plans (getting a job, working out), but the lack of detailed strategies and my frequent digressions suggest a less rigidly planned approach.  I get things done, but my methods are less about meticulous planning and more about general intention.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  The essay reveals my feelings of being overwhelmed in a new, larger environment (UT) where people aren't as friendly as in my smaller hometown.  I’m more comfortable with smaller, familiar groups than large, diverse social settings.  I don't actively seek out new people but value existing friendships.","I can be quite opinionated and unafraid to voice my discontent, even if it might seem blunt to others. The essay shows some underlying frustration at the new college environment and its pressures to conform.  While I'm not openly hostile, I prefer stating my own opinions clearly without always prioritizing harmony. Conforming to others' views doesn't really appeal to me.","I definitely tend to worry and feel anxious.  The essay shows this throughout, with my concerns ranging from losing my remote to anxieties about fitting in at college and the existential dread inspired by psychology textbooks.  I react to stress by ruminating and letting my thoughts wander; my methods of dealing with anxiety seem to be more about distraction than structured coping strategies.",n,y,y,n,y
984,"I've always been fairly conventional in my pursuits, preferring familiar routines and established paths. However, starting college was a massive leap into the unknown, a completely new environment and a different way of thinking than high school ever required.  It was mostly fear—fear of failing and disappointing my family—that motivated me to push myself to adapt. Now, I'm feeling a mix of stress and excitement; it's certainly a challenge, but also thrilling in a strange way.","My goal is to succeed in college, which is proving to require intense focus and time management. I'm trying to create a structured schedule, prioritizing assignments, and utilizing digital tools to help me stay organized.  I am finding it challenging to maintain this level of self-discipline, particularly when the pressure from my family is overwhelming. Yet, the desire to prove myself is driving me to stay on track, and the small wins give me motivation.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained.  The constant interaction and need to maintain a certain energy level can be exhausting. However, being surrounded by girls at college is less draining and feels more like a supportive community than a pressure-cooker of social demands. This has clarified my preference for smaller, more intimate social circles and a need to have personal downtime to recharge.","I haven't had many significant disagreements with anyone since arriving at college, which is a positive aspect of the experience.  The essay shows that I am dealing with my family's expectations and pressures; however, I have not openly challenged them. I avoid direct conflict due to concern about upsetting my family. My priority is to maintain a peaceful relationship despite inner conflict and differing opinions.","The stress of college has been overwhelming.  My initial response is often anxiety; I tend to overthink and worry about failing.  To manage this, I've tried to establish a routine to create a sense of control.  It's helpful, but the pressure remains.  I feel the need to succeed to meet the expectations placed on me, and that adds another layer of stress.",y,y,y,n,y

I didn't know what to expect, but I was curious about how it would feel to reconnect with someone I know so well in a new setting.  It turned out to be incredibly relaxing and fulfilling; laughter just came naturally.  This reaffirmed the importance of close relationships for my well-being.","Balancing academics and extracurricular activities has been a challenge. While I know classes are a priority, I'm also drawn to the various clubs on campus, though I haven't yet figured out how to prioritize them effectively.  Managing my time and energy is tough, especially when the dining hall closing times and unexpected schedule changes (like the Labor Day holiday) throw things off.  I find the sheer volume of choices overwhelming, which makes it hard to stay on track.","Spending time with Lindsey was an incredibly energizing social experience.  The ease of our interaction, the shared laughter, and the lack of pressure to be anyone other than myself were incredibly refreshing. It's made me realize that true connection is energizing, while superficial interactions can be exhausting. I crave those deep, easy friendships.","I haven't had any major disagreements here yet, but the essay reflects my desire for harmony in relationships.  I value understanding and connection above all else, so I'd approach any conflict by trying to understand the other person's perspective. My priority would be finding common ground and preserving the relationship, even if we don't fully agree.","The transition to college has been stressful.  The unfamiliar environment, noisy dorm, and bright window disrupt my sleep, leading to vivid, unsettling dreams.  I also struggle with feelings of being overwhelmed by the choices before me.  To manage this, I rely on comforts like my friends and the anticipation of things like pizza, and I've tried to adjust to the new environment (though the bright window still bothers me). The thought of a pet offers further comfort.",y,y,y,y,y
986,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  My focus has been entirely on adjusting to college and keeping up with my studies, which leaves little time for exploring new things.  The pressure to succeed is consuming, leaving me with a feeling of obligation rather than curiosity. My current priorities do not allow for much openness to new situations.","I'm incredibly focused on my goals, especially academics.  I meticulously plan my schedule, creating detailed to-do lists and prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance.  Time management is crucial; I often sacrifice leisure time to ensure all assignments are completed ahead of schedule.  While this approach has its rewards, the intensity can be overwhelming and leave me stressed.","Social situations tend to drain me rather than energize me.  Even spending time with my roommate is something I like but also find draining.  It's not that I dislike people, I just find that being around others takes significant effort.  This experience highlights my need for solitude to recharge, revealing my introverted nature.","Disagreements are difficult for me; I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  In my relationship with my boyfriend, I let things fester rather than address them openly, which often leads to a build-up of resentment and emotional distress. This avoidance is born from a fear of conflict which only exacerbates things.","I am prone to anxiety, especially when overwhelmed.  The transition to college, coupled with academic pressure and relationship issues, has triggered intense stress and feelings of inadequacy.  My response is often worry and introspection, but I'm working on developing healthier coping mechanisms, recognizing the importance of acknowledging my feelings.",n,y,n,n,y
987,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly a thrill-seeker, but I did recently transfer to a new university, which was a pretty big change.  It felt a bit like starting over as a freshman again, even though I'm a junior.  The initial feeling was a bit unsettling, but ultimately, I’m finding it a positive experience and it's pushing me out of my comfort zone.","This semester has been a juggling act.  I've set goals for myself to stay on top of my coursework, especially the lab reports that are causing me so much stress. I prioritize tasks, using to-do lists and scheduling to ensure I'm making steady progress. Even though there are some challenging aspects, like my disorganized Government professor,  I'm committed to using my time effectively and succeeding. The reward of completing tasks and having a clear plan makes the effort worthwhile.","Going home this weekend to see my family will be energizing. I really enjoy being around my family, and I feel that spending time with them recharges me.  Conversely, large, unfamiliar social situations can be draining— I prefer smaller gatherings with people I'm close to.  I learned that I need time alone to recharge after more extroverted social experiences.","I recently had a disagreement with my boyfriend's roommates about chores.  My priority was to find a solution that works for everyone while remaining respectful and understanding.  Instead of conflict, my approach is to maintain a cooperative environment; I believe open communication and compromise are key to resolving differences.","I get stressed easily, especially when dealing with challenging coursework and lab reports, and I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed right now because I haven't finished. My initial reaction is often annoyance, but I try to manage it by breaking tasks into smaller steps and making a plan to make sure I complete it, and reminding myself of my progress.  Exercise helps me manage stress; I try to go to the gym 3-4 times a week.",n,y,y,y,y
988,"I'm not really one for trying new things, at least not on purpose.  Most of my experiences are driven by my desires and impulses, whether it's a new relationship or a new way of thinking. The experience itself is often overwhelming and confusing. I have a hard time stepping outside of my established habits or ways of thinking.","I struggle with long-term goals. My focus shifts rapidly, and I often get distracted. While I might have aspirations, I find it hard to maintain the discipline needed to achieve them.  Any success I have comes from short bursts of energy rather than sustained effort.  Challenges frequently lead to procrastination, and rewards are mostly short-lived pleasures.","Social situations are usually draining for me. I prefer more intimate interactions, and large groups tend to leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.  Meaningful connections with specific people are the most fulfilling interactions, and anything beyond that feels like an unwelcome intrusion. These experiences reinforce my preference for smaller, more intense relationships.","Disagreements are difficult, but I generally try to avoid conflict. I'll usually agree just to keep the peace, even if I don't really agree. When I do express disagreement, it's usually indirectly, with little consideration of my personal feelings in the matter. My priority is on maintaining a semblance of harmony and avoiding confrontation.","Stress and anxiety are common for me. My initial response is often to avoid the situation or numb the feelings with substances.  I don't usually have constructive strategies, and coping mechanisms tend to be short-term solutions like drinking or smoking pot.  I rarely address the root causes of my stress.",y,n,n,y,n

It forced me to be more independent and meet new people, which I wasn't sure I wanted initially.

I am trying to manage my time and keep up with my classes, but staying on top of things feels like a work in progress. I'm pretty spontaneous, so planned schedules aren’t always my forte.","Last night was a memorable social experience. Even though I was initially hesitant to ask a stranger for a ride because it was so late, and that was a little reckless, I managed to get back to my dorm safely.  While I'm generally an introvert, I realize that pushing myself to meet people in new environments can be positive. Overall, I prefer smaller, more intimate social gatherings.","I haven't encountered any serious disagreements yet, but I generally try to avoid conflict.

While I can procrastinate—AOL is a big time-waster!—the fear of not achieving my dream is a powerful motivator.  I try to manage my time by setting small, achievable goals, but maintaining consistent effort is a constant struggle.","My birthday party tomorrow with all my friends from home will be draining.  While I desire friendships and crave connection, large social gatherings are exhausting. Quiet time alone or with a few close friends is far more fulfilling for me.  The upcoming party is more of an obligation than something I truly want.","My roommate's presence on my date with Ty created a conflict. I invited her out of genuine kindness, wanting to include someone I felt was lonely, despite possibly hurting Ty's feelings.  My priority was making sure my roommate felt included, although I regret this decision a bit now, reflecting on how my actions might affect others.","My parents' divorce deeply affected me, leading to intense anxieties about abandonment.

I do appreciate a good movie, though I'm not really into scary ones.","I'm pretty good at meeting deadlines and managing my time, especially when it comes to social goals, like keeping up with my friends. It's easier to stay organized when I'm doing something I really enjoy. I don’t sweat the small stuff. In college, it's more about showing up and enjoying the campus life and socializing with friends, rather than having a strict academic schedule.","Meeting up with my old ""girlfriend"" was a great social experience.  Seeing her, even briefly, and talking on the phone later, gave me a real boost of energy.  I generally enjoy social interactions, especially with people I already know. It’s exciting and reinforces my desire to connect with people.","I haven't had major conflicts lately, but I tend to avoid confrontation.

However, my knee injury in high school forced me into a new realm – orthopedic surgery. Initially, I wanted to be an orthodontist, a fairly predictable path.  The experience of the surgery and recovery was completely unexpected, but it opened my eyes to a new field and career path that I find intriguing.  It was a necessary, albeit initially unwelcome, change.","Getting into medical school is a huge goal, and I know it requires intense effort. While high school was more about ""getting by,"" I now understand the importance of hard work.  My approach is to diligently focus on my studies and maintain high grades.

Everything has been so overwhelming – classes, sorority stuff, and the apartment hunt – that I haven’t had the time or energy to explore new hobbies or ways of thinking.  I guess I'm open to new experiences, but right now, I just need to get through the semester.","Getting my life organized in college has been a huge challenge. I did try to plan things out; I really did make a detailed schedule of classes, meetings, and study time. But the sheer amount of new responsibilities and the stress of the apartment situation made it almost impossible to follow. I made some progress, but still feel very behind in so many areas. This has been a very frustrating experience, and I need to improve my time management.","Going out with my sorority sisters is usually energizing. We have a lot of fun together, and I enjoy feeling accepted and included.  However, some parties get out of hand – a drunken brawl as the essay says – and that leaves me feeling quite drained, actually. I’m definitely more of an extrovert overall but can also need alone time to recharge.","My parents and I had a disagreement about the apartment. I was upset about the lease and the deadlines and didn't handle it well. I missed class because of it, which just made things worse. I really value my relationships with my family, but sometimes I struggle to communicate my frustrations without things escalating. I need to improve my communication skills.","Everything about college has been stressful so far. Missing that class, the apartment search, and keeping up with everything for sorority – it all piled up. I ended up going home to my family to try and regroup and de-stress.

The time constraints of this essay demonstrate that.  I tend to procrastinate and approach tasks in a haphazard way, often prioritizing immediate gratification over long-term goals.  Challenges often lead me to abandon tasks rather than persevere.",Social interactions generally drain my energy rather than energize me. I much prefer my own company and find prolonged social engagements exhausting and frustrating.

I do my assignments, eventually, but prioritizing tasks isn't really my strong suit.  Procrastination is a significant challenge, often leading to a last-minute rush.

My intense feelings for Kristin, and my resentment towards her boyfriend, make compromise difficult. I'd probably avoid direct confrontation, but my thoughts are filled with unspoken resentment rather than assertive conflict resolution.","My feelings are frequently intense and easily influenced by my thoughts.

The thought of researching it further, even professionally, really appeals to me.","I tend to be more spontaneous than strictly organized.

I often rely on immediate inspiration and adaptability rather than strict schedules or detailed strategies.  That said, my desire to succeed usually motivates me to complete tasks, even if my path is less conventional.","I definitely enjoy meeting new people and forging connections. The prospect of college and making new friends is truly energizing for me. Although I value my existing friendships and close relationships, I thrive in situations where I can connect with others in a larger, more vibrant social environment.  The excitement of new experiences is very rewarding.","I'm generally easygoing and willing to compromise. Even if I disagree with someone, I prioritize understanding their perspective before stating my own opinion.  I find that approaching conflict with empathy leads to better resolutions, even if the ultimate outcome isn't exactly what I originally envisioned. My preference is for cooperation and mutual respect.","I experience fluctuations in mood, sometimes feeling very good, and sometimes not as positive.  When stressed, I find it helpful to engage in something engaging, like focusing on a stimulating academic task or something completely unrelated like planning a spontaneous trip.  While I'm ambitious, I also recognize the importance of self-care and emotional regulation to maintain balance.",y,n,y,y,n
997,"Trying to write this essay is a completely new experience for me! I’m usually more of a people-watcher and observer, but this is forcing me to focus inward and organize my thoughts. It's challenging, but also kind of exciting to see what comes out of it.  I was motivated by the assignment itself and the inherent curiosity to explore my inner self.  I'm not sure how I feel about the experience yet, it's still unfolding!","Balancing my social life, academics, and water polo practice is a constant challenge. I often have multiple things vying for my attention at once. Although I don't have a rigorous system, I usually find myself getting things done at the last minute. Procrastination is my biggest enemy! Yet, I always manage to pull it together somehow. This essay is a good example—I'm tackling it right before water polo practice, fueled by whatever's left over from my fridge raid. The challenge is staying focused, the reward is the sense of accomplishment after finally finishing.","Spending time with my best friend Alexander is always energizing. He's my rock and we both have the same level of emotional instability so he always knows what I need.  We can hang out for hours just talking and supporting each other, especially right now since we're both going through breakups. Conversely, large social gatherings or situations where I'm expected to be the center of attention often leave me drained. This is because I value deep connections, which usually are not achieved in large social settings, but I value time alone more than most people do, so I don't mind being by myself.","I try to be understanding of others, even when I disagree. For example, I find my roommates hilarious even if they're frustrating because they're so distracting. However, I have to admit, my ability to engage diplomatically is highly situational.   If the disagreement is petty or doesn’t involve something I deeply care about, I might just laugh it off, as I did with my roommates calling each other names. The priority is maintaining a generally positive and entertaining atmosphere.","My migraines are a significant source of stress and anxiety. When one hits, I feel overwhelmed, and I tend to just make some noise to release it, like I'm doing now. I find that talking to Alexander or doing something physical, like my water polo practice, helps me cope. While I have many stressors in my life, my water polo keeps me grounded and healthy, allowing me to better manage the stress in the other aspects of my life.",y,y,y,y,n
998,"I don't really seek out new experiences, I'm pretty content with my routine.  Football is about as adventurous as I get, and even then, I ended up with a headache.  The fraternity keeps me busy enough; I don't really have time or the inclination for anything too different.","I’m not exactly known for my planning skills.  I procrastinated on this assignment, prioritizing the fraternity party instead.  Staying on task is a struggle for me; it's easier to just go with the flow.  The party was more rewarding than this assignment, that's for sure.","Large social gatherings, like the fraternity party, energize me. The camaraderie, the shared experience, and the sense of belonging are all very fulfilling.  Quiet, introspective activities drain me. I need that interaction to feel good.","I'm pretty easygoing. Conflicts don't usually bother me; the rivalry between Phi Psi and ATO doesn't phase me. The sign was funny, so I don't mind.  If there's a conflict I mostly just try to avoid it or let others handle it.","I get stressed easily.  I oversleep, get headaches, and am generally pretty impatient.  To deal with stress, I usually distract myself, maybe with a party or a football game.  I don't dwell on problems; I push through or avoid them entirely.",y,n,n,y,n
999,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they make me a little nervous.  Last year, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class, something completely outside my usual comfort zone.  It was partly driven by curiosity – I’d always admired the art form – and partly a desire to challenge my routine. Although I wasn't naturally gifted, I enjoyed the process and found it strangely relaxing.","I set a goal to finish my college applications on time, which was a significant undertaking involving essays, transcripts, and financial aid forms.  I used a planner to meticulously track deadlines and broke down the larger task into smaller, manageable steps. Although I often procrastinated, ultimately, I made sure to prioritize my applications as deadlines approached, pushing through moments of self-doubt to ensure timely submission.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me; I find them overwhelming. Conversely, spending time with a close friend, like Nicole, feels incredibly energizing. Deep, meaningful conversations with someone I trust makes me feel refreshed and fulfilled. It’s reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings.","I recently disagreed with a classmate about a group project's direction. I prioritized understanding their perspective before presenting my own, attempting to find a compromise that valued everyone's ideas.  While I didn't entirely agree with the final outcome, maintaining a respectful dialogue was more important than winning the argument.","I tend to be anxious when things feel uncertain or out of my control. A recent example was awaiting results from a significant exam.  Initially, I felt overwhelmed and panicked.  To manage this, I focused on things I could control like reviewing material for the next exam and maintaining healthy sleep patterns.  This helped me cope with the stress and approach the situation rationally.",y,y,n,n,y
1000,"I'm not someone who jumps into radically new experiences without careful consideration. However, I did recently start reading Shakespeare, something I'd always meant to do but put off.  The motivation was partly academic – I figured I should familiarize myself with the classics – but also a desire for self-improvement, intellectual stimulation, and to discover if it lives up to the hype. It's a slow process, but so far, I find it surprisingly engaging and rewarding.","I set a goal to complete my homework and assignments on time. To manage this, I created a simple schedule, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable parts. I used reminders and to-do lists and generally stick to my schedule, finding it helpful to prioritize tasks based on deadlines. This was rewarding as I avoided late submissions and felt a sense of accomplishment from meeting each deadline. The most challenging part was maintaining focus, which I am still trying to master.","A large social gathering leaves me feeling drained. I find that these large events are often overwhelming and filled with superficial interactions.  In contrast, one-on-one conversations with friends generally energize me. The difference is the level of intimacy and genuine connection.  It's reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings rather than crowded, noisy places.","I recently disagreed with a friend regarding a decision they were making.  I chose to express my concerns and thoughts calmly and respectfully, rather than engaging in an argument. My priority was to maintain the friendship while also voicing my opinion. This approach allowed us to discuss our differing perspectives constructively.","I've felt anxious when facing an upcoming deadline.  My initial response is usually a sense of overwhelm and a tendency to procrastinate. To manage this, I try to take a break, breathe deeply, and remind myself of my abilities.  Breaking down the task into smaller parts and focusing on one step at a time helps tremendously.",y,y,y,n,n
1001,"Honestly, I haven't really done anything new lately.  Life's been pretty routine. I guess the closest thing would be trying a new coffee shop, but even that wasn't very exciting.  I just needed a caffeine fix, and it wasn't a big deal.","I'm trying to get better at planning, especially since I have so many bills coming up.  I made a list of everything I need to pay, but  I haven’t really been able to stick to a budget.  Staying on top of everything is hard, and I often get distracted.","Going out with my friends is usually fun, but sometimes it's exhausting.  I like being around people, but  I need my alone time to recharge. Sometimes, social events are more draining than energizing, and I just want to go home.","I avoid confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I usually just try to let it go unless it’s unavoidable. I prioritize avoiding conflict more than getting my point across. It’s easier that way.","I get stressed easily, especially when I'm short on time and money, like now. Usually, I just try to distract myself, maybe by texting a friend or watching something on my phone. It's not a great way to deal with it, but it works for me.",n,y,y,n,n
1002,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I prefer the familiar and comfortable.  The thought of doing something radically different makes me anxious, honestly. While I haven't actively sought out new experiences, sometimes I'm forced into them, and I tend to stick to what I know.","I struggle with managing my time and achieving long-term goals.  My essay shows that even a simple assignment like this one can feel overwhelming.  Staying on track is a constant battle.  Procrastination is a huge problem, and I often leave things to the last minute, which results in increased stress and anxiety.","Social situations often drain me.  Being around large groups of people or even engaging in extensive conversations can leave me feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. I prefer small, intimate settings with people I know well. My loneliness and homesickness mentioned in the essay highlight this preference for close relationships rather than large social gatherings.","Disagreements are difficult.  I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, and if forced to confront it, I struggle to assertively express my views.  Maintaining harmony and avoiding upsetting others is a higher priority for me than forcing my perspective on someone else.  My worry about others' opinions and my desire to avoid disapproval point to this.","I am very prone to anxiety and stress.  As shown in my essay, even minor inconveniences or uncertainties can trigger significant worry.  I tend to overthink and dwell on negative possibilities, often leading to feelings of overwhelm and unease.  Managing my anxiety requires conscious effort and sometimes even professional help.",y,n,n,y,y
1003,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences, but college itself has been a huge shift.  Being in large lecture halls filled with strangers was initially intimidating, a far cry from my small high school classes. Yet, the challenge of meeting diverse people and engaging with new ideas in my courses has been unexpectedly stimulating. The whole experience has broadened my perspective and forced me to think critically, which I find exciting.","I wouldn't say I'm the most organized person.  Juggling classes, new social situations, and the anxieties of independence hasn't always been easy. I haven't developed a strict, detailed schedule.  Instead, I prioritize immediate tasks, focusing on what feels most pressing or interesting. My success in college so far is less about rigid planning and more about adaptability and a determination to keep learning and stay engaged.","The large lecture classes, while initially daunting, have actually been a really positive social experience.  Meeting so many different people daily energizes me, even though it can also be draining to navigate so many social interactions at once.  I value this diversity and relish the opportunities to build new relationships. Small, intimate settings can sometimes bore me, so the large college environment keeps me actively engaged.","I generally try to be agreeable and understanding.  However, there have been instances in discussions where I've politely but firmly expressed a differing viewpoint. My priority is respectful dialogue and mutual understanding, even if we don't fully agree.  I believe in voicing my perspective while still valuing the other person's point of view.  Constructive disagreement can lead to deeper understanding.","The prospect of total independence after 18 years of parental support is quite anxiety-inducing.  My initial response was a mixture of excitement and fear. To manage this, I focus on the positive aspects of college, such as new learning and social opportunities.  I also remind myself of my parents' teachings about critical thinking and reasoned argumentation, which give me confidence to face whatever challenges I encounter.",n,n,y,y,n
1004,"I’m not usually one for spontaneously trying new things.  I’m pretty comfortable in my routine, but the email mishap this morning definitely pushed me outside of my comfort zone! It forced me to problem-solve quickly and creatively in a stressful situation, which I guess was a new kind of challenge. Afterward, I was relieved but also a little shaken; it made me realize how much I rely on technology and how fragile things can be.","I'm a total mess, honestly!  My room's a disaster; I have a huge to-do list with schoolwork, chores, and even calling my crush—I struggle to prioritize and stay organized. I often find myself procrastinating because I'm easily distracted. However, I do value my education and am determined to finish school despite my poor planning skills.","Talking to my crush is really energizing – he makes me feel comfortable and happy.  On the other hand, large social gatherings or even just talking to people I don't know well can leave me completely drained. I think I’m an introvert at heart; I need my alone time to recharge, and close friendships are more fulfilling than broad social networks.","I’m pretty easygoing, and I try my best to see things from other people's perspectives. Even when I disagree with someone, I prioritize maintaining the relationship and will try my best to find common ground. I'm usually willing to compromise and even change my mind if I see a valid point. It's easier to do so with people I feel comfortable with.","I definitely get anxious and stressed easily. The email incident this morning made my heart race, and the thought of calling my crush is making me even more nervous.  I tend to overthink things and worry about what others might think. To cope, I try to distract myself – often by focusing on my other tasks (though they pile up).  Deep down, though, I know I need to find healthier ways to manage my anxiety.",y,n,y,y,y
1005,"I recently started attending a Bible study group. While I'm generally introspective and prefer quiet time, the idea of connecting with others who share my faith was appealing. The experience has been surprisingly positive, allowing me to broaden my perspectives and engage in meaningful discussions.","I haven't been great at managing my time lately; schoolwork piles up, and I often feel overwhelmed.  I struggle to prioritize tasks and stick to a schedule, though I know the importance of organization. My main focus is often on spiritual matters, which sometimes overshadows other responsibilities.","A recent lunch with an old friend was draining.  He constantly talked about partying, which contrasted sharply with my values and lifestyle. This highlighted my preference for deeper conversations and meaningful connections rather than superficial social interactions centered around alcohol and casual sex.","I've had disagreements with people at university about their partying habits and lifestyles, which I find morally objectionable based on my religious beliefs.  I try to be respectful, expressing my concerns calmly but firmly, prioritizing honesty and expressing my values even if it leads to conflict.","Feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork and personal anxieties sometimes triggers feelings of stress and anxiety. I often turn to prayer and reflection to manage these emotions, focusing on my faith and trust in God's plan, as these give me comfort and stability amidst the chaos.",y,n,y,y,y
1006,"I'm not sure I'd call it trying something ""completely new,"" but starting college was definitely a big change.  It was motivated by a desire for independence and to pursue my education. Afterward, I felt a mix of excitement and overwhelming anxiety; it's a whole new environment, and I'm still working on adjusting.","I set a goal of maintaining good grades despite the challenges of college life.  To stay on track, I made a schedule and tried to stick to it, though it wasn't always easy. I found the long hours challenging but rewarding knowing I was working towards something important.","Most social experiences drain my energy.  Spending time with my boyfriend Gary is an exception; his kindness and selflessness make me feel supported and understood. Interactions with certain people, like Jennifer and Karen, however, leave me feeling stressed and emotionally exhausted.","I've had many disagreements with Karen and Jennifer. My priority is usually to avoid confrontation, which is challenging. I tend to internalize conflict rather than directly address it, even though I know it isn't always the best strategy.","College is stressful; feeling overwhelmed by the new environment and academic pressure is a frequent occurrence. My initial response is usually to withdraw, but I try to manage my anxiety by talking to Gary and spending time with my close friends Lucy and Josephine, who are more understanding.",n,y,n,n,y
1007,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty content with my routine.  The thought of trying something completely different feels overwhelming and frankly, a little pointless.  I'd rather focus on what I know and what I'm comfortable with.","I struggle with long-term goals.  I start with good intentions, but maintaining consistent effort is difficult.  My time management is usually pretty haphazard, and I often get sidetracked. I frequently end up rushing things at the last minute.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  Large groups, especially, are exhausting.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings or spending time alone.  I need plenty of downtime to recharge after social events.","If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my opinion to myself rather than causing conflict. While I value harmony, it sometimes means that I suppress my own feelings or perspectives to avoid confrontation.  I prioritize maintaining a peaceful relationship.","Stress and anxiety are common feelings for me.  When things get overwhelming, I tend to become irritable and withdrawn. I might try to distract myself, but productive coping mechanisms often elude me.  I don't always handle difficult emotions constructively.",n,n,n,y,y
1008,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty content with my routine.  The essay reflects this—I mention wanting familiar things like my mom's cooking and my car, not a desire for novel activities.  While I mention a stepshow, the lack of transportation prevents me from attending, highlighting my lack of initiative in pursuing the unfamiliar.","I'm not the most organized person. My essay shows a lack of planning and prioritization.  I mention needing to do laundry and get trash bags, but there's no indication of a structured plan to accomplish these tasks.  Procrastination seems to be my default mode; I say I *should* do things, but rarely outline how I'll actually do them.","I enjoy socializing with my roommates, as evidenced by my mention of meeting them at a wing meeting.  However, my desire to have my car so I can go to the mall alone suggests a preference for some alone time, as well. I'm comfortable in social situations but don't appear to crave constant social interaction.  The essay doesn't provide examples of draining social situations, but my focus on personal needs hints at a preference for manageable social engagement.","I'm generally agreeable and empathetic.  I worry about Jennifer and her car troubles, expressing concern and suggesting a solution.  I am not someone who enjoys confrontation. The essay lacks examples of direct conflict, but my focus on alleviating Jennifer's distress demonstrates my willingness to help and show concern for others.","I don't seem to be overly neurotic, despite my homesickness.  My anxiety seems manageable; while I express frustration and annoyance (stupid song on MTV, parking situation), I don't exhibit overwhelming distress or panic. My thoughts are largely focused on practical matters rather than intense emotional turmoil.",n,n,y,y,n
1009,"Listening to Lena Horne's music sparked a desire to explore a different side of myself.  Her throaty, sensual voice made me contemplate my own expressiveness and what it might mean to embrace a different artistic expression.  While I didn't actually try singing, the experience fueled a desire to delve into something new, despite my apprehension.","I tend to avoid structured goal-setting. The writing assignment felt like a task to just get over with. I didn't employ any specific time management techniques; I wrote impulsively, fueled more by immediate urges (hunger, boredom, strong feelings) than a carefully crafted plan.  The ease of the assignment was probably rewarding in a sense, highlighting my lack of commitment to structured work.","Social interactions leave me feeling drained. The essay mentions feeling annoyed with Lisa for not calling, showcasing a preference for solitude and an aversion to overly engaging social interactions. The lack of connection with people around me and my internal struggle to figure myself out is draining, rather than fulfilling, for me.","The essay reveals several instances of disagreement, yet my approach to conflict appears passive. For instance, my internal conflict between my feelings for Ryan and my fears of his reaction went unaddressed. Similarly, I noted the cultural differences around jazz appreciation, rather than actively engaging in discussion or finding common ground. I'd rather avoid confrontation.","Feeling overwhelmed and stressed is depicted frequently, often linked to anxieties around social expectations and self-doubt.  My response is a mixture of self-deprecating humor and impulsive writing, serving as a form of emotional release.  I don't explicitly outline constructive coping strategies within the essay, suggesting a preference for letting emotions flow freely rather than actively managing them.",y,n,n,y,n
1010,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and experiences, although I'm selective.  While I wouldn't go to a frat party, I've actively sought out new musical experiences, joining the Concert Committee of the Texas Council to expand my access to live music. This reflects my desire for intellectual and artistic stimulation, rather than social ones.  The feeling afterward is a sense of accomplishment and a renewed appreciation for my existing interests.","I'm highly conscientious; my psychology homework is a priority, even when faced with social invitations. I meticulously manage my time to ensure I meet deadlines and balance my academic responsibilities with other commitments, like attending church-related events with Holly. I'm disciplined and committed to my goals, even if that means forgoing social activities considered typical college experiences.","Social interactions generally drain my energy. The invitation to the frat party was overwhelming and unwelcome; it highlighted my preference for smaller, more intimate settings with people I know and trust, like my roommate Holly.  This reinforced my introversion and desire for deep, meaningful connections over large, superficial interactions.","I tend to be less agreeable, especially when my values and priorities are challenged. I'm clearly not fond of the Kingwood people at my college, and I feel frustrated when others try to push me into social situations I don’t want to be in, such as a frat party. My priority in disagreements is to maintain my own personal space and values.  I prefer to avoid conflict, but will certainly express my discomfort directly.","The essay reveals a significant amount of anxiety and stress regarding college life, family issues, and spiritual uncertainty. My initial response to stress is introspection and reflection, which I express through writing.

1011,"I haven't really tried anything *completely* new lately.  Most of my experiences feel like variations on things I already know. I guess joining a sorority was a big change, but that was more about social pressures than exploring a new part of myself.  I’m more focused on things I already like, like studying and spending time with close friends – those are the things that make me feel comfortable and in control.","Balancing school, sorority activities, and making friends has been a huge challenge. I stay on track by planning my week meticulously, prioritizing my studies, and scheduling specific times for everything.  The weekends were a big help in terms of organization.  I find it rewarding when I manage to fit everything in, but the constant need to juggle everything can feel very overwhelming at times, especially when events like rush came up and made everything even more hectic.","I have really enjoyed spending time with my roommate; she's really helped me stay sane and upbeat amidst the chaos of college. That interaction energizes me – I value those genuine connections. On the other hand, larger social events, like sorority parties, can leave me feeling drained. I find those interactions shallow and overwhelming because I have trouble keeping up with the pace and feeling like I can truly connect with everyone there.","I'm generally very agreeable, but there are times I prioritize my well-being over agreeing with others.  For example, I had to skip lunch with Leisha to catch up on my philosophy reading, which was a tough decision. My priority in resolving such a conflict is preserving the friendship, while also ensuring that I meet my own needs. I feel bad when I have to make that sort of choice, however.","The pressure to succeed academically and socially makes me anxious. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw a bit and focus on things I can control, like studying or spending time with my roommate.  I try to use strategies like planning and prioritizing my tasks. I think having the support system of my close friends and my roommate is crucial in dealing with my anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n

I'm usually more focused on the sciences, but I was intrigued by a description of existentialism, and I wanted to challenge my typical way of thinking.

I’m considering exploring other humanities subjects next semester.","Getting into medical school is a huge goal for me, requiring intense focus and careful planning. I've created a detailed study schedule, breaking down my coursework into manageable chunks, and I make sure to prioritize my studies.  When I feel overwhelmed, I break down big tasks into smaller ones. Maintaining this level of commitment is sometimes hard; I definitely have moments of self-doubt and procrastination.  It's rewarding knowing I’m actively working towards my dream.","I found a social gathering incredibly draining recently. I went to a loud party with my friends, and the constant noise and the overwhelming amount of people left me feeling exhausted and irritable afterward. I realized it was much more than being introverted, I need a lot of alone time to recharge, especially after being around a lot of people for an extended period. It confirmed that quiet, intimate settings are better suited to my social needs.","I often find myself disagreeing with my parents about rules and expectations. I approach these disagreements by trying to calmly explain my perspective, highlighting the reasons behind my viewpoints.  My priority is to maintain a respectful relationship while still advocating for my independence. Understanding each other's positions and perspectives is always the goal, even if we don't always see eye to eye.","I get very stressed when I feel I'm not meeting my expectations in school or other aspects of my life. I felt a huge amount of pressure at the start of this semester, and my anxiety manifested in poor sleep and digestive issues.  To handle it, I focus on establishing good routines involving study, exercise, and relaxation.  Regular check-ins with myself and my friends help manage those anxious feelings and keeps me moving forward.",y,y,n,y,n
1013,"I joined a sorority, something I'd never considered before.  I was motivated by the desire to make close friends and be part of a social group. While I ultimately didn't get into my top choices, the experience of trying out and attending rush events opened my eyes to different kinds of social dynamics and helped me understand my own social needs better.","I set a goal to get good grades in college despite my dislike of writing and the pressure to perform. My time management wasn’t great, often interrupted by social events and my own anxieties. I procrastinated, especially on papers, which made the whole process more stressful.

It was fulfilling because I connected with people who shared my values, and being in a supportive environment was a much-needed relief.

My priority is to maintain a level of politeness, but I can get annoyed and frustrated.  I try to voice my concerns calmly, but sometimes I fail to do so directly which results in unresolved tension.","I get incredibly stressed by social situations, especially when I feel I'm being judged.

I was motivated by a desire for self-awareness and a hope that it would help me understand and resolve my internal conflicts. While it's been challenging at times, it has provided a sense of clarity that's been surprisingly helpful.","I often set goals for self-improvement, like getting back to a healthier weight or improving my relationships.  While I plan these meticulously, I often struggle with the sustained effort required.  My attempts at time management are frequently unsuccessful; I'm easily distracted and find it difficult to stay focused on long-term goals.  The biggest challenge is overcoming my self-doubt and lack of confidence to follow through, even though I know I'm capable of change.","Social interactions are a mixed bag for me.  Energetic gatherings with close friends like Greg and Nathaniel leave me feeling fulfilled and appreciated. Their support is crucial, especially when dealing with my self-doubt.  However, situations where I feel judged or unsure of myself can quickly drain my energy. These experiences highlight my need for genuine connection and acceptance, and emphasize that I do better with intimate, supportive groups rather than large gatherings.","Disagreements are usually difficult for me. I prioritize maintaining relationships and often avoid direct confrontation, even when I disagree. My desire to be liked and accepted can make me hesitant to express my feelings fully in conflict.  I focus on understanding the other person’s perspective and finding common ground, but sometimes this leaves my own needs unmet.","I experience significant anxiety and stress, often tied to self-doubt and worries about others' perceptions of me. My initial response is often overwhelming self-criticism and rumination. To manage my emotions, I reach out to trusted people, Greg and Nathaniel in particular, for support and reassurance.

My writing about needing to get a 4.0 GPA suggests a desire for academic success, but my essay reveals a lack of consistent planning and execution. My approach to studying seems somewhat sporadic, driven by immediate anxieties about falling behind, rather than a well-structured plan.","Social interactions can be draining. My observations of others, and my comments about hating Judy and Charlie, suggests I prefer smaller, intimate social circles.  Large gatherings or interactions with people I dislike are likely to leave me feeling depleted, rather than energized.","I tend to express my negative opinions quite freely, as seen in my judgments of Judy, Charlie, and my stepfather.  My approach to conflict isn't necessarily conciliatory; I seem to prefer expressing my disapproval directly, even if it means causing offense.  Maintaining harmony isn't my highest priority in those situations.","I'm highly sensitive to negative experiences and express my emotions strongly, as evidenced by my numerous complaints and outbursts in the essay. While I don't offer specific coping strategies for stress, my frequent expressions of anger, sadness, and frustration suggest that I struggle to manage negative emotions constructively.",n,n,n,n,n

But this semester, I'm taking a web-based class, which is forcing me to engage with technology more than I'd like. While initially apprehensive, I'm finding that it's making me more comfortable with computers, even though it's a bit of a struggle. It's pushing me out of my comfort zone, and the experience has been a surprising mix of frustration and gradual progress.","One of my goals is to stay on top of my coursework and maintain a consistent workout routine. To stay organized, I use planners and set reminders on my phone. I find it challenging to balance everything, especially with social activities and unexpected demands on my time. Despite the difficulties, I'm motivated by wanting to improve both my academic performance and physical fitness. I celebrate small wins to keep my momentum up.","Going to the gym alone can be isolating, which is why I sometimes ask a friend, Jane, to join me.  When I do have someone to go with, the workout is so much more enjoyable. The shared experience creates a sense of camaraderie and makes the effort less draining.

I'm learning that even brief positive interactions help me feel more connected and less alone.","I haven't had many serious disagreements lately, but I tend to prioritize understanding the other person's perspective in any conflict, even if I disagree.  I try to listen attentively and explain my point of view calmly and respectfully. My goal is to find common ground and maintain a positive relationship, even if we don't fully agree. If a disagreement escalates, I tend to avoid confrontation and try to find a compromise or respectfully agree to disagree.","I tend to get stressed, especially when I feel overwhelmed by my workload or social interactions. When stress hits, I initially feel overwhelmed, which sometimes leads to breakouts. To cope, I find it helpful to listen to music, talk with friends, and get more sleep. I believe that managing stress involves a combination of self-care and addressing the root causes of my anxiety.  Addressing my stress and anxiety through talking it out with friends and getting more sleep seem to be helping.",y,y,y,y,n
1017,"I'm not really one for trying entirely new things.  I prefer sticking to what I know and what's comfortable. This summer, college was new, and while I met lots of people,  it was more about the social aspect than exploring any unfamiliar activities or ideas.  I guess the preview program was sort of new, but mostly it was a chance to party and meet girls.","I'm not the most organized person. Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my strong suit. My summer grades show that.  I knew I should have studied harder for pre-calculus, but I let things slide.  I spent way too much money and don't even know where it went.  I guess I could say I had a goal of doing well in school, and I kind of failed at that.","I love being around people! The preview program was amazing because I met tons of people and got to party. That kind of social interaction really energizes me. It's easy for me to make friends, and I thrive in those high-energy, fun environments. Being alone for too long isn't my favorite.","I generally get along with people. Even with that teacher who I thought was a ""bitch,"" I didn't really confront her. I was frustrated, yes, but I just accepted the grade and moved on. I'm not one for conflict; keeping the peace is more important.  I’m more focused on having fun and enjoying myself than on causing any problems or disagreements.","I'm usually pretty happy-go-lucky, but my grades this summer really bummed me out.  I let my disappointment affect me more than I usually would.  The stress and frustration came from the pre-calculus grade; usually, I don't get this caught up on grades. I think I dealt with it by just accepting it and moving on. I know I can do better next semester.",n,n,y,y,n
1018,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly a free spirit.  Trying new things isn't really my thing. College is new, and I guess the parties are a little different than what I'm used to, but I'm mostly sticking to what I know. I went to that lame party last night because my brother was in town, not because I was looking for something novel.","Getting good grades is a big goal for me, especially to stay in my fraternity.  I'm using a tutor for calculus because it’s killing me and that’s a strategy I'm using to succeed. I need to keep my grades up and keep paying my dues. It’s challenging, but the rewards of staying in Phi Kappa Psi are worth the effort.","Last night's party was a total bust.  Being around so many people, and having it be a disappointment, really drained me.  I thrive in social situations, but only when they are good ones, like the party I expect to go to tonight. I like the energy of a great party. I need to be around like-minded people to feel energized.","My roommate drives me nuts. He's loud, and he thinks we're best friends just because we live together.  I've tried to be agreeable, hoping we could be friends, but he's so inconsiderate that I think I'll end up punching him out. I'm prioritizing my own sanity.","My girlfriend didn’t call last night like she said she would. It made me really angry and stressed.  I just sat and fumed for a while until my anger subsided, then I focused on the upcoming party and tried not to dwell on it.  I use distraction to manage my stress.",n,y,y,n,y
1019,"I wouldn't say I actively seek out new experiences; change often feels unsettling.  However, I did attend that UT freshman orientation dance, even though the idea terrified me. My motivation was a combination of peer pressure and a desperate hope for connection, something I deeply crave, even if I'm terrified of truly experiencing it. The experience was ultimately disappointing, reinforcing my existing anxieties about social interaction and my fears of rejection.","I'm not particularly driven by long-term goals.  Instead, I tend to react to immediate pressures. My workout routine, for example, is more about managing anxiety and self-image than achieving a specific athletic goal. It's driven by a need to feel in control rather than by a meticulous plan or commitment to a certain timeline. I find the routine somewhat rewarding in that it offers a sense of accomplishment, but the process isn't always consistent and is subject to bouts of procrastination.","Social situations tend to exhaust me. The orientation dance is a prime example.  The constant interaction, the need to constantly be “on,” drains my energy. While I yearn for connections, the fear of rejection and the high-energy demands of many social settings leave me feeling depleted rather than invigorated.  I find myself retreating inward to recover afterward.","Disagreements are difficult. I often prioritize avoiding conflict, even if it means suppressing my own opinions or feelings to keep the peace.  I tend to accommodate others' views, often at my own expense. This stems from a desire to avoid confrontation and maintain a sense of approval from others. The underlying reason for this behavior is more about my personal insecurities than a genuine desire to compromise or collaborate.","I experience anxiety quite frequently. It often manifests as self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy, as seen in my reaction to the rejections at the dance. My initial response is typically avoidance or self-criticism. To manage these feelings, I tend to retreat, relying on solitary activities like exercise as a form of coping, but these are less constructive problem-solving mechanisms and more of a distraction from dealing with the core issues.",y,n,n,n,y
1020,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  My excitement is usually reserved for things I already know and enjoy, like baseball games. Though, I did watch ""Conspiracy Theory"" which was different from my usual movie choices.  It wasn't a bad experience, but I wouldn't say I was moved to explore similar films.","I wouldn't say I'm the most organized person.  My approach to homework is usually determined by upcoming deadlines, meaning if I have something big tomorrow, I will do that. I tend to focus on things that have immediate consequences rather than on long-term planning.","Large social gatherings aren't really my thing.  I find them draining. I much prefer quieter moments, perhaps watching a baseball game with a few close friends or family.  Social interactions that involve a lot of noise and a large amount of people aren't for me.","I'm not always the best at agreeing with others. I prefer to state my opinion and see what happens. I did find myself disagreeing with those who believe that the new Houston stadium location is better than the Astrodome. I tend not to care much what others think of my opinions, however.",I don't usually stress out about things too much. I tend to focus on what excites me.  Thinking about the Astros making the playoffs and seeing a game in the Astrodome helps me focus on a positive and exciting prospect.

1021,"I don't often seek out completely new experiences; change tends to make me anxious. However, I did once impulsively sign up for a salsa dancing class.  My motivation was mostly boredom and a fleeting desire to do something different. Afterward, I felt a mix of awkwardness and mild exhilaration – mostly relief it was over!","I struggle with time management and sustained effort.  Goals often get sidelined, even those that are personally important.  I might start with good intentions, using planners or lists, but I quickly lose steam when challenges arise.  The rewarding part is the sense of accomplishment when I *do* finish something; the challenge is the constant struggle to maintain momentum.","Social interactions tend to drain me. Large gatherings or extended conversations leave me feeling exhausted and irritable.  The most fulfilling social experiences involve close friends and small, intimate gatherings. These interactions are less demanding and allow for quiet reflection.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, sometimes to the point of suppressing my own feelings. My priority is to maintain peace and harmony, even if it means compromising my own needs.  I often internalize conflict, resulting in more stress later.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My initial response is often avoidance or internalizing the feelings.  I tend to worry and overthink instead of dealing directly with the problem. To cope, I might listen to music or engage in distracting activities, though I acknowledge this isn't always constructive in the long run.",y,n,n,n,y

The music was really energizing, and it helped me feel a bit better after a tough breakup. It was definitely outside my usual comfort zone, but it was a good experience.","I haven't really had much success setting and achieving long-term goals.  My major is Radio-TV-Film, but I'm also interested in psychology.  I struggle with staying focused and often get sidetracked. I tend to procrastinate on tasks like doing laundry and finishing books, and I am generally pretty lazy.","The reggae show last night was a great social experience that really energized me.  Being surrounded by so many people enjoying the music was uplifting. I find large gatherings of people sometimes draining because it requires a lot of energy.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social interactions with close friends.",I don't really handle disagreements well.  I tend to avoid conflict. The breakup with my girlfriend was more of a drifting apart than an outright argument. I value avoiding conflict but that sometimes means I don't deal with issues head-on.,"I've been feeling pretty down lately, especially since the breakup.  Initially, I just felt numb and unmotivated.

This assignment is a prime example – I'd rather be asleep.","I don't really set long-term goals. I'm more of a go-with-the-flow kind of guy.  If something needs doing, I'll do it, but I don't usually plan things out in advance.  Time management isn't really my strength.","Social situations usually drain me.  Being around a lot of people, especially in my dorm which feels overcrowded and uncomfortable, is exhausting.  I prefer smaller groups or spending time alone.  Large gatherings, like my roommate’s gatherings, feel overwhelming and intrusive.","I don't always get along with people, especially those who judge me or act superior. My roommate constantly lectures me, and frankly, it makes me angry. I tend to avoid conflict, but when pushed I'll express my annoyance rather than engage in a proper resolution.","Stress usually makes me irritable and cynical.  I tend to complain rather than actively dealing with the problem.  I guess I cope by venting my frustrations, like in this essay.",y,n,n,n,n
1024,"I wouldn't say I actively seek out completely new things.  The party last night was a bit outside my usual routine, though. It was fun, dancing and meeting people, even though I don't usually go out of my way to socialize like that.  I'm not sure I'd call it transformative, but it was a nice change.","I have a lot of reading and homework to catch up on. Keeping on top of my studies is a major goal. I try to manage my time by creating a schedule, but it doesn't always work as planned, especially when unexpected things happen, like friends staying over.  It's challenging to balance social life and schoolwork, but  it's rewarding to feel accomplished when I manage to finish things.","The party was memorable, and while I had fun, I also felt drained afterward.  Being around so many people, even though I enjoyed meeting some guys, was exhausting. I think my social battery is relatively small; I prefer smaller groups and more intimate settings.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but I can get anxious when I think about my friends liking the same guys I do. I haven't confronted them, though. I'll probably just let it play out. I guess my priority is maintaining the friendships, even if that means being a little passive about the guys I like.","I get stressed easily, especially when dealing with academic pressure.  When I feel overwhelmed by homework, I tend to procrastinate at first. I know I need to study, but the task seems overwhelming. I try to break down the work into smaller, manageable tasks to ease the anxiety. The phone call situation also added to my stress because my parents have strict rules about guys being in the house.",n,y,n,n,y

While I did try a new Bible study, it wasn't a dramatic departure from my usual activities; rather, it’s an extension of what I already value. I felt positive about it - excited to meet new people with shared beliefs.","I've been working on improving my time management.  It's a constant struggle! I have a lot of things going on: classes, running, seeing friends and family, and even remembering to buy my brother a birthday gift. I make lists and try to prioritize, but sometimes things slip through the cracks, which stresses me out. It’s rewarding when I manage to accomplish everything on my list; the challenge lies in balancing my social life with my academics.","Spending time with my best friend is always energizing.  He’s funny and positive, and just being around him lifts my spirits. Conversely, when people are excessively loud or demanding, it drains me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings. This experience reaffirmed my appreciation for close friendships.","I generally try to be agreeable, but sometimes I have to speak up.  The situation with the girl using two towels was a minor conflict; I wanted to address it calmly but directly. My priority was to explain my resource constraints without being confrontational.","I get stressed when I'm behind on schoolwork, or when I haven’t been able to run in a few days.

Goals often fall by the wayside.  My time management isn't great; I tend to get overwhelmed and procrastinate.  I admire people who are organized and disciplined, it’s not really a strength of mine.","Social situations are usually draining for me.  Being around a lot of people increases my anxiety.  I crave quiet time to recharge. I prefer the company of a few close friends to large, energetic gatherings.","Disagreements are difficult for me to navigate.

Coming to this sorority was a huge step outside my comfort zone; I was worried about being different and didn't know anyone. But the scrapbook project and the kindness of the other pledges opened me up to a whole new world of friendship and self-discovery. This experience has taught me to embrace the unexpected and find joy in the unknown.","Balancing school, sorority life, and maintaining my relationships has been a challenge. I make lists, prioritize tasks, and try to schedule my time effectively. I’m determined to succeed because I don't want to disappoint my parents. Sometimes, even with careful planning, things don't go according to plan, but I persist because I know the rewards—like finding the right sorority for me—are worth the effort.",The party tonight is a perfect example of an energizing social experience.  Being around people who are happy and friendly boosts my spirits.  I crave this kind of interaction because it recharges me; it shows me the value of strong connections and that not every social encounter will be draining.,"There have been disagreements with my suite mate about… well, boys.  While I value my virginity, she doesn't share my beliefs. Instead of arguing, I try to understand her perspective and respect her choices. My priority is to maintain a respectful relationship, even if we have different values.","Starting college and being away from home has been really stressful.

I've been trying to stay on top of it, but I've also had to be patient.  The challenging part is relying on others, and the rewarding part is finally having everything in place.","Being in this quiet room, working on this essay with my roommates asleep around me, is definitely draining. I thrive on social interaction, so being around people who energize me is essential. I prefer spending time with close friends who make me feel comfortable and accepted.","I'm generally agreeable but I do value my own thoughts and opinions. Sometimes I have to compromise.  I tend to avoid direct conflict to maintain a harmonious relationship. If disagreements happen I try to approach them calmly and understandingly, seeking common ground.","I definitely get stressed when things are uncertain.

Meeting new people and experiencing the energy of the campus is exciting. I enjoy connecting with my roommate, even though sometimes I have moments of feeling self-conscious. The most draining interactions involve juggling my desire to socialize with the demands of my studies and longing for my girlfriend and family.

It felt both overwhelming and a little exciting.","I struggle with consistent goal-setting and follow-through.  My essay reflects that.  The fact that I even started writing this essay at all represents a goal that I haven't quite managed to achieve properly yet.  I often feel overwhelmed by what I have to get done, leading to procrastination and a sense of being behind.  The thought of carpal tunnel syndrome from all this typing is another example of where I lack foresight and long-term planning.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  The constant influx of people in my apartment, and the numerous strangers I have to interact with in the university, exhaust me. I yearn for solitude and quiet.  I am happiest alone, and the prospect of a faraway place where I can be anonymous is appealing.","I tend to internalize conflict rather than confront it directly. This is evident in my frustration with my roommates and their friends, and my inability to express my needs for quiet and uninterrupted sleep. While I feel resentment, I lack the assertive personality to directly express that. I prioritize my own well-being but am unable to effectively communicate that well.","I am prone to anxiety and stress. The password issues, overwhelming environment, and difficulty sleeping are all triggers that bring on stress.

It reinforced my preference for physical activities as a way to boost my energy levels and improve my mood.","I'm not naturally conflict-avoidant, and I often prioritize my own views, even if it means confrontation.  I am a firm believer in being honest and getting to the bottom of what one is unhappy about, and I prefer direct and upfront conversations, even if they're uncomfortable. It's more important for me to feel my concerns are taken seriously than to maintain superficial harmony.","I don't typically experience high levels of stress or anxiety. I tend to have a pretty even-keeled disposition.  Even when facing challenges like this assignment, I maintain a positive outlook.  Perhaps that’s partly due to my natural tendency to focus on the positive aspects of any situation. My ability to stay grounded and optimistic helps reduce my stress response and allows me to approach challenges constructively.",n,y,y,n,n
1038,"I’m not really one for trying new things spontaneously.  My essay shows how much I value routine and familiarity.  However, joining a sorority was a big step outside my comfort zone, driven by a desire to make friends and experience college life to the fullest.  While it's been fun, it also introduced a level of social pressure and time commitment I hadn't anticipated.","Balancing sorority life, academics, and my social life has been a huge challenge.  I've tried using planners and to-do lists, but I struggle with time management.  I’m aware that I need to improve my study habits and prioritize academics, especially given my goal of transferring to the communications school.  The reward is the potential for academic success; the challenge is finding the discipline to achieve it.","Sorority events are usually energizing, filled with social interaction and new experiences. The energy of being around so many people is exhilarating, even if it's overwhelming at times.  Quiet time alone, however, is something I crave but find difficult to achieve. The essay reflects this need for balance, between engaging socially and needing time for myself.","I generally avoid direct confrontation. My essay demonstrates a tendency to worry about others' opinions and a desire to fit in. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground or simply avoid the topic altogether.  Prioritizing harmony over expressing strong disagreements is often my go-to approach.","The essay clearly shows my anxieties around academics, social situations, and maintaining friendships.  My initial response to stress is often worry and overthinking.  I try to manage this by talking to friends and family, but I haven't yet developed effective coping mechanisms to address my anxiety constructively.",y,y,y,y,n
1039,"I don't often seek out new experiences.  The funeral was unexpected, and while I felt upset, I couldn't pinpoint why.  New activities don't particularly appeal to me; I'd rather stick to what's familiar. The thought of trying something completely new fills me with a sense of unease and uncertainty.","I struggle with goal setting and sustained effort.  Time management isn't my strong suit; I often feel overwhelmed by the thought of maintaining consistent progress towards a long-term objective. I don't employ any specific strategies to stay focused, which is probably why I get easily distracted and lose track of what I intended to accomplish.","Social interactions leave me feeling drained more often than energized.  Spending time with others, even people I care about, is exhausting, and I crave periods of solitude afterward to recover. Deep conversations or large gatherings deplete my mental energy; quiet time is essential for recharging.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to avoid confrontation and often prioritize maintaining harmony over expressing my own opinions forcefully.  I find it challenging to articulate my perspectives during conflicts, and I often end up feeling frustrated and unheard.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions. My initial response to stressful situations is often internalized worry and rumination. I don't have any clearly defined strategies for coping,  which only exacerbates the negative feelings.  I tend to withdraw and overthink things, which makes it hard to respond constructively.",n,n,n,n,y
1040,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately,  mostly sticking to familiar comforts like music.  Bringing my guitars back home this weekend feels like a step towards normalcy, a comfort.  I suppose learning to play Metallica with my mom could be considered new, but it stems from my love of music, not a desire to branch out into wholly unfamiliar territory.","Setting and maintaining goals isn't really my strong suit.  My sobriety is a testament to my ability to overcome challenges, but it was more about survival than meticulous planning. I focused on short-term milestones (like reaching 101 days clean) rather than long-term strategies.  The reward of my doctor's pride was far more powerful than any structured plan.","Social interactions usually drain me. I prefer the company of my guitars and my own thoughts. Even spending time with family can be tiring; even though I'm happy Erin's getting a car, that interaction feels less fulfilling than the quiet satisfaction of playing music.","Disagreements tend to make me withdraw. I'm not one for confrontation.  If someone disagrees with me, I'd rather avoid the conflict than aggressively defend my position.  My priority is to maintain peace and quiet, even if it means silently accepting a differing viewpoint.",The thought of losing my sister because of a car accident stresses me out immensely. That anxiety is deeply rooted in my past reckless behavior and its consequences.  My response is to focus on my sobriety – that's my coping mechanism; it's my way of controlling the things I can.  My doctor's pride offers a powerful counterpoint to my anxieties.,y,n,n,n,y
1041,"I’ve always been somewhat resistant to new experiences, preferring familiar routines. However,  the necessity of returning to school after so many years forced me to confront new technologies and learning methods. While initially daunting, adapting to the computer and online learning environment proved surprisingly rewarding, though I still find many aspects challenging and frustrating.","My return to university required significant time management and self-discipline.  Balancing work, coursework, and personal life demanded meticulous organization and prioritization. While I occasionally struggled to maintain momentum, my commitment to earning my degree pushed me forward, and the sense of accomplishment has been rewarding.  The most challenging aspect has been overcoming my self-doubt and age-related anxieties, but that is slowly improving.","Social interactions typically drain my energy. I find large groups overwhelming, preferring smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well.  My time in the restaurant business involved a lot of interaction with people, leaving me consistently exhausted, and contributing to my decision to leave it.  The ideal social interaction for me would be a quiet, meaningful conversation with one or two trusted individuals.","Disagreements aren't something I typically engage in,  I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. When faced with a disagreement, I often prioritize finding common ground and understanding the other person's perspective before expressing my own viewpoint directly. I'm generally more focused on maintaining peace than pushing my own views.","The pressure of returning to school after a long break triggered significant anxiety. Initially, I responded by procrastinating and avoiding tasks, which only amplified my stress. To manage my anxiety, I focused on breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps and celebrating small victories. Finding support from others has also proved beneficial.",y,y,n,n,n

I was motivated by a desire to challenge myself academically and reconnect with a skill I enjoyed.  I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I'm loving it; it's reignited my passion for the language.","I've set a goal to work out at least four times a week to improve my fitness. I use a planner to schedule my workouts and try to stick to it, even if it means making adjustments based on my classes and social commitments. Although sometimes I miss a workout, overall, this has been rewarding because of how much better I feel physically and mentally.","A recent trip to a ""country"" place with friends was incredibly energizing.  The fun atmosphere, the dancing (twostepping!), and the social interaction all contributed to a positive experience.  It reinforced my preference for social situations with close friends that involve physical activity and good times.","My roommate and I have been getting along exceptionally well, despite having known each other for a long time.  I anticipated potential problems, but we've been incredibly compatible, showing a great level of mutual understanding and tolerance from the start.","The heat in Austin has been incredibly stressful. My initial reaction is annoyance and a desire to stay inside, but I cope by focusing on my exercise routine and adjusting my schedule to avoid peak sun hours. It helps me to maintain a sense of control during the challenging circumstances.",y,y,y,y,n
1043,"Trying something new isn't really my style. I tend to stick to what I know and what feels comfortable.  However, starting college was definitely a huge change—a new environment, new people, and a whole new way of life. It was scary, but the motivation was simple: it was the next step, and everyone expected me to go.  It’s still pretty overwhelming, honestly.","I'm not the most organized person.  Goals?  I have them, but following through? That’s the hard part.  Getting to my morning classes?  That’s a goal I somehow achieved, though I’m not sure how I’ll manage it again.  I rely more on bursts of energy than structured planning. I tend to get things done eventually, even if my methods aren't always the most efficient or organized.","I thrive in social situations with people who understand me.  Meeting this new guy who ""gets"" me in a way my old boyfriend never did is incredibly energizing. It's a welcome contrast to the draining experience of dealing with Justin's controlling behavior. Being with someone who is genuinely kind and understanding makes a huge difference in my energy levels.","Disagreements are tough. I try to be agreeable; I want everyone to like me. I'd rather avoid conflict if I can. With Justin, it's been a difficult situation because I love him deeply, despite his flaws. My priority is being kind and understanding, but also protecting myself from the negativity.  I’m not sure how to reconcile those two needs.","I get stressed easily.  Pulling all-nighters and still making it to class leaves me exhausted. Yesterday’s birthday celebration was a relief and much needed distraction. I cope by focusing on the things I enjoy, like spending time with my mom and celebrating things that make me happy, even if it comes with a little bit of exhaustion.",y,n,y,y,n
1044,"I rarely try new things.  The essay shows I'm focused on the immediate, pressing issues like my doctor's appointment and assignment deadline.  Novelty isn't a priority; getting things done is.  Even when faced with a car accident, my response was practical and focused on minimizing immediate disruption.","I struggle with conscientiousness.  My essay highlights procrastination (the writing assignment deadline), poor planning (leaving early and causing the need to take my brother back to Austin), and impulsive decisions (letting the other driver go after the accident).  While I set goals (like quitting smoking), my actions suggest a lack of sustained effort.","Social interactions drain me. The essay describes my negative feelings after seeing Jenn at the CSA meeting.  Forcing Rona to attend despite her apprehension further illustrates a lack of social ease and sensitivity to others' feelings. I prefer solitary activities, even though I occasionally engage in social situations due to obligations.",I'm not particularly agreeable.  My conflict with Rona is handled with indifference and a lack of consideration for her feelings.  Prioritizing my own schedule and needs over hers demonstrates a lack of empathy and concern for others' perspectives.  I focus on my own immediate concerns.,"I experience high levels of stress and anxiety.  The essay reveals significant emotional distress arising from the car accident, the impending deadlines, and interpersonal conflicts. My internal monologue shows immediate negative responses, self-blame, and regret without constructive coping mechanisms, reflecting a high level of neuroticism.",n,n,n,n,y
1045,"I went to that awful Burning Man festival once. A friend dragged me along, promising an experience unlike any other. I wasn't exactly thrilled about it beforehand; I'm not a big fan of crowds or anything remotely hippie. But the whole thing turned out to be... surprisingly stimulating. Although, I wouldn't do that again.  I guess the novelty wore off pretty quickly.","Ugh, goals.  I set one to graduate college, but honestly, procrastination was my middle name.  I’d cram for exams and then blow off studying for weeks.  The only thing that motivated me was the fear of failing. I ended up getting through it, but not in any sort of organized way.  It was stressful, and I would never recommend that approach to anyone.","Going to Elements nightclub totally energizes me.  The music, the people, the drinks; it's a sensory overload that I crave.  The energy is infectious, and I just feed off it. Quiet nights in, on the other hand? Not my thing at all. I need that social buzz, at least sometimes.","Disagreements? I tend to avoid conflict as much as possible.  Usually I just nod and agree to whatever the other person says, then forget about it as soon as they're gone. My priority? Keeping the peace, even if it means burying my head in the sand.  If the argument gets too heated, I generally just walk away.","Stress? I get stressed out constantly. Anxiety is my default setting. When I'm overwhelmed, I usually just numb myself with whatever's closest at hand. Alcohol helps, for a while. Then, the worry and anxiety always come back. It's a vicious cycle, but I haven't found a way out of it yet.",y,n,y,n,y
1046,"I’m not exactly sure what counts as “completely new,” but I guess going to that Dave concert will be pretty new. I'm mostly motivated by the fact that I can't wait to see Dave, but also that I could network with Preston, maybe even get his number.  I'm hoping it will be a really fun night and that I'll meet some cool people there too.","I don't really set goals in the traditional sense. I mean, getting to the Dave concert is sort of a goal, but I’m not sure how I’d even manage my time and resources. I’m tired and bored, and just kind of letting things happen as they do.  I tend to focus on whatever feels most interesting at the moment.","Being around lots of people at a concert can be energizing... or completely draining. It depends on the people.  A group of interesting people, maybe even some new people, will definitely energize me. On the other hand, a bunch of couples being all lovey-dovey and ignoring me drains me. I need to strike a balance between social interaction and having my own space, which is difficult.","I try to avoid conflict. I think that's why people like me. I figure if I'm nice to everyone, they'll be nice to me. I mostly just ignore problems and hope things get better on their own. Sometimes it works, but other times, like with Kelly, it's clearly not working out.","I get stressed and anxious easily.  My neck is so stiff, it’s killing me! I often bottle it up; today, after hearing about Kim's problems, I almost cried but held it back. I try to distract myself with fun plans, like the Dave concert, which helps for a little while. I need to figure out a better way to deal with my emotions.",y,n,y,n,y
1047,"I’m not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The essay shows a lot of my inner thoughts and worries.  While I say I hope Cat can get her CD burner working, that's really about wanting a specific song, not a desire for novel experiences. My focus is usually on familiar things and people.","I definitely struggle with long-term goals. My essay is a jumbled stream of thoughts about immediate needs and wants—dinner, seeing Kyle, avoiding the retreat.  I clearly don’t have a great system for time management or sticking to plans; deadlines seem to sneak up on me.  I’m more reactive than proactive.","The essay shows I crave social interaction, particularly with Kyle and my family.  Spending time with people I care about energizes me – I get excited about seeing them. However, the constant social activity described (""go out every night and wake up at 9"") is also causing exhaustion and stress.  It highlights a need for balance.","I generally try to get along with others;  the essay doesn't depict any major conflicts. My focus is on my own feelings and plans (retreat, birthday gifts, money), which doesn't directly speak to conflict resolution. My desire for social connection suggests I value getting along with people but I am also very self-focused.","The essay is full of anxiety and stress.  I worry about many things—money, schoolwork, social events, and family. My immediate responses involve procrastination and avoiding certain tasks.  I do have some coping mechanisms (shopping, working out), but the overall tone reflects significant neuroticism.",y,n,y,y,y
1048,"I'm always looking for new experiences.  Thinking about getting my lip or eyebrow pierced is a pretty good example, even though it’s a bit out there. I also want to try rollerblading again, even though I got discouraged last time. The thought of trying something new, something different, is really exciting to me.","I’m not the most organized person, but when I set my mind to something, I usually follow through, even if it takes time.  I mean, I really want to get my TV set up right, so I've been figuring out the cords and connectors and trying to get the right length cords.  I really have to work through things step by step. I guess that's my way of keeping on track.","Going out with friends is amazing.  It energizes me. Being around people, especially my friends, is when I feel the most alive and happy.  However, I can get pretty drained by people I don’t know or who don’t share my enthusiasm. I prefer to be with smaller groups of close friends than large crowds.  I also definitely need my alone time to recharge.","I can be pretty blunt, which might not always be seen as agreeable.  Like, that fight with the woman in Cancun – I just couldn’t stand her attitude.  I didn't back down, I didn't really try to be nice or to get to understand her perspective in the moment. Even with friends, if I feel strongly about something, I'll express my opinions, even if they disagree with mine. That does cause friction sometimes.","I tend to get stressed when my plans are interrupted or when things don't go according to plan.  For example, the way that girl told me I couldn't go rollerblading because of the rain and the cop really got on my nerves.   I get frustrated easily, but usually, I just try to find something else to do or take a break until I can deal with it better. I don't dwell on it for too long.",y,y,y,n,n
1049,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly eager to try new things.  Sticking to what I know is usually my preference.  The only thing remotely new I've done recently was starting college, and even that felt overwhelming, not exciting.  I'm more focused on getting through the day than exploring anything new.","I'm definitely not the most organized person. That paper was a nightmare.  I pulled all-nighters, neglecting sleep and other responsibilities.  My time management skills are severely lacking, which contributes to my stress and frustration. There wasn't any strategy; it was just frantic last-minute effort.","Social interactions drain me.  Being around my girlfriend is great; seeing her daily is a highlight of my life. But other social situations, especially large groups, leave me exhausted and irritable.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm comfortable with.","I get frustrated when people are inconsiderate, like the students disrupting my calculus professor. I tend to internalize my anger rather than confronting people directly. I value knowledge and respect for authority, and it bothers me when others lack those things.","I'm easily stressed and anxious, especially when my computer malfunctions and I lose my work.  My initial reaction is panic and frustration.  To cope, I try to get more sleep, but that's difficult when I'm up all night.  I tend to feel overwhelmed and exhausted when under pressure.",n,n,n,n,y
1050,"I've never been one for trying drastically new things.  My mind tends to focus on things I know and understand, like my family and my dog. However, starting precalculus was a step outside of my comfort zone, and while I found it challenging, it wasn't something I actively sought out, but rather something I felt I needed to do.  I'm more curious about the familiar than the completely unknown, and the feeling afterward was more one of apprehension than exhilaration.","I'm not the most organized person; goals often take a backseat to what immediately grabs my attention.  While I have a strong desire to help children someday, I haven't developed a concrete plan to achieve that goal.  I tend to focus on immediate tasks and feelings rather than long-term planning and strategies.  Honestly, I find the sustained effort required for long-term goals quite challenging, which is probably why I haven't focused on creating a specific plan yet.","Social situations can be draining.  Large groups or overly stimulating environments leave me feeling exhausted. I much prefer smaller gatherings with close friends or family, and even then, I need my alone time to recharge. The essay reflects this; I focus more on my internal thoughts and feelings, showing a preference for introspection over extroverted activities. My energy is better spent with those I'm close to; a quiet evening with my dog is better than a loud party.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising on my own views to some degree. I value harmony and believe that empathy and understanding are more important than being ""right.""  This is reflected in my strong feelings for my somewhat dysfunctional family; I value the relationships even with their complexities.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. My initial response is often a feeling of overwhelm, leading to rumination and worry.  To cope, I try to focus on the things I can control, like spending time with my dog or focusing on my close family relationships. Ultimately, my emotions influence my thoughts and outlook significantly.  I find comfort in stability and the familiar, which helps me manage intense feelings.",n,n,n,y,y
1051,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences for the sake of it, but I'm open to trying things when they seem worthwhile.  Managing the pool last summer was definitely outside my comfort zone – I’d always been a follower, not a leader.  The experience taught me a lot about responsibility and leadership, and while it was challenging, it was ultimately very rewarding and helped me grow.","Balancing my classes, my relationship, and my social life takes effort.  I manage my time by making to-do lists and prioritizing tasks.  Staying committed is about balance; I’m not rigid, but I do make sure to keep my promises and meet my deadlines.  I find it challenging to juggle everything sometimes, but knowing that I'm making progress is very rewarding.","Spending time with my boyfriend is energizing; we have a relaxed, comfortable dynamic that feels restorative.  Conversely, navigating the initial awkwardness of finding my first class, and having to ask so many people for help, left me a bit drained.  I prefer smaller, intimate interactions and those that are relatively relaxed.  Larger social gatherings tend to feel overwhelming.","I try to be understanding of others' viewpoints.  Even when I disagree, I try to see things from the other person’s perspective. For example, my roommate’s sorority sisters decorating the room – it was a bit much with the balloons, but I appreciated the gesture and understood their enthusiasm. My priority is maintaining positive relationships and finding common ground.","I generally handle stress pretty well, but I admit getting lost trying to find my first class initially caused me some anxiety. My immediate response was to ask around. Finding the class eventually and seeing it all work out helped me manage it effectively. I don't dwell on setbacks; I prefer to move forward and solve problems.",y,y,y,y,n

I'm usually pretty introspective, but this time I acted on a whim, driven by curiosity about someone who simply had a nice smile. It was a surprisingly impulsive thing to do, and the experience left me feeling a mix of embarrassment and a strange sense of wonder about the power of a smile.","I haven't really set any long-term goals yet; college feels overwhelming and chaotic. I find it hard to focus on studying even though I'm aware it's crucial. I have difficulty managing my time and resources effectively. My current strategy is just showing up, which isn't exactly a strategy at all.","Going to the computer lab to see that guy was not energizing.  Social interactions usually drain me.  I prefer quieter moments of reflection, and being around people often leaves me feeling uncomfortable and self-conscious. This experience reinforced my need for solitude and my preference for one-on-one interactions instead of large groups.","I haven't had a major disagreement recently, but I tend to avoid conflict.  My priority is maintaining peace, even if it means compromising my own views. I find it hard to assert myself and often prioritize the comfort of others over my own feelings.","I'm prone to anxiety and self-doubt, and the chaotic feeling of college life is exacerbating that.

The experience itself ended badly (fractured vertebrae!), but it certainly stands out as memorable, even if in a painful way.","I struggle with long-term goals. My attempt to get my internet working, for example, took two days of sporadic effort before I finally solved it. Time management isn't my strength; I tend to work in bursts of activity followed by periods of procrastination.

Going out with Laura tonight is an exception, but I generally prefer quiet time alone.  Large, noisy gatherings are overwhelming, whereas one-on-one interactions with close friends are much more manageable. My current mood is indicative of a preference to avoid social situations and recover from the day's events.","Disagreements are stressful for me. My frustration with my internet problems and my art history professor exemplifies my lack of patience with incompetence. I tend to express my displeasure directly, sometimes perhaps even aggressively.  Resolving conflict isn't my strong suit; I prefer to avoid confrontation whenever possible.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress. The internet debacle sent me into a tailspin of frustration, tears, and near-computer-tossing. My initial response is usually emotional; I tend to overreact.

1054,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  The essay reflects my focus on structured routines and familiar activities. While I mention considering dropping a class, it’s more from a pragmatic perspective of maximizing my GPA than a desire to explore a new academic area.  My primary focus remains on my existing commitments and goals.","The essay shows my high level of conscientiousness.  I meticulously plan my study schedule, prioritizing tasks and managing my time efficiently to ensure I stay on top of my coursework.  Even with challenges (like the website being down), I adjust my plans and maintain focus on completing everything thoroughly and on time.  The reward is the satisfaction of completing tasks and the inherent stress reduction that comes with it.","I derive energy from my alone time, which the essay clearly shows.  My ideal social interaction is limited and centered around my boyfriend. While I mention the gym, it’s a solitary pursuit focused on self-improvement rather than a social activity.  Large social gatherings or extensive socializing appear to drain me, as evident in my preference for quiet study sessions and solitary pursuits.","The essay doesn't explicitly show major conflicts, but it subtly reveals a low agreeableness. My self-critical thoughts and focus on personal flaws (""I have the quickest temper and stubbornness"") hint at a potential difficulty in compromising or yielding to others' perspectives during disagreements. My focus is mainly on self-improvement and meeting my own standards, without much emphasis on interpersonal harmony.","My high neuroticism is heavily emphasized in the essay. The constant worry about grades, weight, and my boyfriend's opinion illustrates a tendency towards anxiety and overthinking. My response to stress involves meticulous planning and organization, a clear attempt to manage my anxiety through control and efficiency.  My stress stems from not meeting my self-imposed high standards.",n,y,y,n,y

It requires a lot of studying and time management.  I try to keep organized, and I make to-do lists, but sometimes I procrastinate.  Getting good grades is really important to me, and my parents would kill me if I do badly; that's a pretty strong motivator, so it helps keep me on track.","Being around my close friends is energizing for me, it's really nice. However, large social gatherings or interactions with strangers can be really draining. I don’t like huge classes because there are too many people. That's why I prefer hanging out with people I know.","I have a difficult relationship with Lina, and we don't get along at all. I find her behavior really annoying, especially the way she lies about her life, and I tend to let my negative feelings be known when I speak about her to other people.

Afterwards, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and a newfound appreciation for artistic expression.","I pride myself on my ability to manage my time effectively. When I had to write a large research paper last year, I created a detailed schedule, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks. I used a planner and set realistic deadlines for each section.  Although there were definitely challenges and times when I felt overwhelmed, I found that breaking down the tasks made the overall process less daunting and helped me stay focused, ultimately leading to a successful outcome. The rewarding aspect was definitely the feeling of accomplishment.","I definitely recharge after social interactions with people I enjoy, although sometimes interactions with people I don't know very well can leave me feeling drained. A memorable experience was a weekend trip to Dallas with my best friends. The constant laughter, shared stories, and feeling of genuine connection really energized me.  It helped me realize the importance of nurturing my close relationships and spending time with people who make me feel comfortable and understood.","I try my best to be agreeable, but there are times when I disagree with someone and need to express my opinion.  A recent disagreement with a classmate about a group project involved a compromise, where we agreed to implement elements from each person's ideas. While it wasn't easy, my priority was maintaining a productive working relationship, and I value open communication and collaboration.","I tend to overthink and get anxious, sometimes unnecessarily. For example, when I had my first driving test I experienced significant stress and anxiety.  My initial response was to panic, but then I took deep breaths, focused on the instructions given, and tried to remind myself that everyone is nervous at some point. This helped me approach the situation constructively, and while I wasn't exactly relaxed, I managed to keep myself calm enough to complete the test successfully.",y,y,y,y,y

I haven't really found anything rewarding about my lack of academic effort, other than the fun I have with my sister's friends.","Hanging out with my sister’s friends is fun, but it's also draining.  It’s enjoyable to be around people, but I don't tend to initiate social contact.  Often, I feel exhausted after socializing; I need plenty of downtime to recharge.  The social interactions aren't necessarily bad, but I need a lot of time alone to recover.","I haven't really had any major disagreements with anyone yet, although I'm sure that'll change. I tend to avoid conflict, letting others have their way to avoid issues. I find it easier to go with the flow and keep the peace, even if I disagree internally.","Starting college has been incredibly stressful, making me anxious and overwhelmed.  My initial response is usually to withdraw and avoid the source of stress, which might involve spending time with my sister's friends or procrastinating on schoolwork. I haven't developed healthy coping mechanisms to manage my anxieties.",y,n,n,n,y
1058,"I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences, preferring the familiar and comfortable. However, starting college was a significant departure from my high school routine, pushing me slightly outside my comfort zone.  While I had some initial apprehension, the increased freedom and flexibility ultimately proved to be a positive change. The overall experience has been positive but gradual in its impact.","I'm aiming to pay off my car, a long-term goal requiring careful budgeting. I use a simple budgeting app to track my expenses and ensure I'm allocating sufficient funds each month. Challenges arise when unexpected costs pop up, but I try to adjust my spending accordingly and stay focused on the overall objective. I find the process of achieving this goal quite rewarding.","A memorable social experience was going out with friends. Although I generally prefer smaller gatherings,  this particular outing left me feeling energized and connected, mostly due to the close bond I share with those friends and the engaging conversations.  I realized that while I value my alone time,  meaningful interactions with close friends are genuinely fulfilling and energize me.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, but if there's a conflict, I'd rather avoid confrontation. I typically try to understand the other person's perspective first, aiming for a compromise or peaceful resolution. My priority is maintaining a positive relationship, even if it means adjusting my own position somewhat.","When I'm stressed or anxious, like when I'm worried about money, I tend to overthink. I initially respond by worrying excessively, but try to manage this by working out or talking to a trusted friend or family member. These methods help me to ground myself and approach the situation more rationally.",y,y,y,y,n
1059,"I haven't really had a situation where I tried something completely new and different, not really.  Most things I do are pretty familiar to me. I guess going to college and moving into my own apartment is kind of new, but even that feels like just a continuation of things I already knew.  It's less about trying new things and more about figuring out how to navigate the next phase of things I already know.","I tend to do things last minute. Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my strong suit, to be honest. If I have something due, I’ll usually just get it done when it needs to be done, often scrambling to meet deadlines. It's stressful, but it seems to work out somehow.  The challenging part is the constant stress, but it's also rewarding in a way to pull things off when I’m under the gun.","Social situations usually leave me feeling pretty drained. I’m not really an outgoing person; interacting with large groups is exhausting. A quiet night at home with close friends is much more my style. Larger, louder events tend to overwhelm me and make me want to escape. It's not that I don't like people, it's just that I need my alone time to recharge.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I tend to avoid conflict if I can, often trying to smooth things over to maintain peace, even if it means compromising my own opinions.  My priorities are to keep things harmonious, and even if I don't agree with someone, I’ll try to understand their perspective rather than directly challenging it. It feels easier, and less stressful, to go with the flow.","I tend to worry a lot.  When I'm stressed, I tend to overthink things and spiral into negative thoughts. I don't really know how to deal with it besides procrastinating and putting things off until I absolutely have to handle them. There's a lot of that in my life. I should find some healthier coping mechanisms, but it's not really on the top of my to-do list.",y,y,n,n,n
1060,"I haven't had many experiences that I would consider truly ""new"" in the sense of radically changing my worldview. However,  spending a weekend with Jason, someone very open about himself, was a new experience for me.  It challenged my usual preference for keeping things to myself, and although it made me a little uncomfortable, it was ultimately a positive experience that encouraged me to be more open with others.","Balancing my studies, social life, and personal well-being at university has been a major goal requiring significant effort. I've found success by using a planner to schedule my time, prioritizing tasks, and breaking down large goals into smaller, manageable steps.  While there are times I struggle to stick to my schedule, I generally find that planning helps me avoid feeling overwhelmed.  The most rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when I meet a deadline or achieve a goal.","Spending time with Jason over the weekend was energizing. His easygoing nature and positive outlook were contagious, and our shared activities felt very fulfilling. In contrast, being alone for extended periods, especially during those two weeks without a roommate, was incredibly draining and left me feeling anxious and lonely. This confirmed my need for regular social interaction and highlighted the importance of surrounding myself with supportive people.","I don't often directly confront disagreements.  Instead, I tend to avoid conflict by remaining quiet or changing the subject.  While this avoids immediate friction, I realize it's not always the healthiest approach. My priority is usually to preserve the relationship, which sometimes means sacrificing my own preferences in order to keep peace.","The two weeks I spent alone without a roommate triggered significant anxiety and loneliness.  My initial response was to binge eat to cope, which I now realize was a maladaptive mechanism. However, acknowledging the root of my distress – the isolation – has allowed me to take steps to manage my emotions by proactively seeking out social interactions.  I'm making a conscious effort to eat meals with others and schedule regular time with friends like Liz.",n,y,n,n,y

The experience was surprisingly relaxing and rewarding; I found a sense of calm in focusing on the clay and the shaping process.","I set a goal to learn a new language. I created a study schedule, utilizing apps and online resources, and consistently devoted time each day.  I found staying committed challenging at times, especially when life got busy, but I used reward systems and accountability partners to keep myself on track.  It was ultimately rewarding to achieve fluency.","A recent party with close friends was incredibly energizing.  The easy flow of conversation, shared laughter, and genuine connection made it a fulfilling experience.  It reinforced my need for meaningful social interaction with people I feel comfortable around. Conversely, large, superficial gatherings often leave me drained.","I recently disagreed with a colleague about a project approach. I prioritized finding common ground by actively listening to their perspective and explaining my own rationale calmly. We eventually compromised, integrating elements from both our ideas.  Maintaining respect and collaboration were my primary concerns.","When facing a significant deadline, I initially felt overwhelmed and anxious.

To fill it, I impulsively signed up for a bunch of clubs and started devouring books on random topics—sewing, butterflies, architecture, you name it. I was hoping to discover a new passion or interest, but it didn't quite work out that way.  The experience showed me I need to be more intentional in pursuing new things, rather than jumping into a bunch of activities at once. It was a bit overwhelming.","I'm not naturally organized.  My ""Man Hunt"" was a case in point – I tried numerous approaches with little planning or structure, leading to frustration. However, once I realized my search was consuming me, I was able to make a decisive shift. I stopped all my dating activities and focused instead on prayer and spending time alone.  This was surprisingly successful in helping me find peace.  I'm still working on improving my organization, but I've learned the importance of setting realistic goals and sticking to them.","Social situations can be draining for me.  My best friend's departure was emotionally intense, but even celebrating with her before she left felt overwhelming in a way.  Spending time with large groups or lots of interactions tends to exhaust me. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings, or quiet moments by myself.  The experience solidified my understanding that I recharge best in solitude.","I tend to avoid conflict.  When disagreements arise, my priority is keeping the peace and maintaining positive relationships, even if it means compromising my own opinions somewhat.  This was apparent in my response to my friend leaving.  I didn't express my disappointment outwardly, choosing instead to focus on celebrating her success.  It's something I’m working on—learning to assert myself more healthily while maintaining good relationships.","Losing my best friend triggered a period of intense sadness and emptiness, and I initially responded by immersing myself in the ""Man Hunt"", which was a way of distracting myself from my emotional pain.  I eventually realized this wasn't a constructive approach and instead turned to prayer and quiet reflection.  This was effective in reducing my anxiety and restoring inner peace.  My faith became a significant source of comfort and stability.",y,n,n,y,n

I was motivated by the assignment, of course, but also by a curiosity to see what would come out.  It's kind of interesting seeing my thoughts laid out like this; it makes me realize how much is going on in my head.","This psychology assignment is a good example.  I'm meticulously checking the time and making sure I meet the 20-minute deadline. I planned my weekend pretty carefully, allotting time for friends and other activities.  The challenge was keeping my mind focused—my thoughts wandered quite a bit.  It's rewarding to complete a task, especially when it involves self-reflection.","Spending the evening with my fraternity brothers was definitely energizing. We bonded over dinner, games, and a swim. The shared experience, laughter, and camaraderie made it fulfilling.  This reaffirms my preference for social interaction and the importance of friendships in my life.","The disagreement with my roommates about the ""dry"" fraternity event was tricky. I firmly supported the president's decision, viewing it as an executive decision within his prerogative.  While I understand my roommates' concerns about a lack of consultation, my priority was upholding what I believed was the right choice for the group's overall well-being.","I get stressed when I have to wait for things – that happened with my friend and also when I’m praying to God.  I usually try to deal with these types of stresses by just distracting myself with something else until I have an answer. Overall, I am pretty patient with things, although there are things that make me impatient.",y,y,y,y,n

I was curious about exploring different ways of thinking and the class turned out to be incredibly stimulating.  I loved grappling with complex ideas and found myself engaging with concepts I never would have considered otherwise. It broadened my perspectives considerably.","I'm committed to my fitness routine, even though it's challenging to fit it into my schedule. I plan my workouts in advance and stick to a regular schedule, finding that if I miss a day, I'm more likely to miss several. Although there are days I dread getting started, the post-workout feeling makes it all worthwhile. The discipline has been rewarding, and I'm proud of my consistency.","Going out last night left me feeling completely drained today. While I enjoy socializing and meeting new people, it was overwhelming to interact with so many people in a short period.  I need time to recharge after social events; otherwise, I tend to feel overstimulated and unwell.  This experience highlighted the importance of pacing myself and being selective about social engagements.","I strive to be straightforward and honest, even when it means disagreeing with someone.  I try to explain my perspective calmly and respectfully, prioritizing mutual understanding over winning an argument. While directness can be challenging at times, I believe open communication is essential for maintaining positive relationships.","I'm feeling really stressed and unwell today, which is likely due to overdoing it last night. My initial reaction was to wallow in self-criticism, but I'm reminding myself to be kind to myself and prioritize rest. I'm trying to focus on self-care today, which includes working out – oddly enough – as it's my way of managing stress.",y,y,y,y,y

Leaving home and facing the challenges of a new academic environment, away from my support system, felt both terrifying and exhilarating. I’m excited to see what the next four years bring and to grow from this completely new chapter in my life.","Maintaining a responsible daily routine and excelling in my classes are my top priorities right now.  Time management is key – I’m trying to create a schedule that balances study time with social activities and self-care. While university is a big change from my easier high school experience, I actually welcome the challenge of having to study diligently.","My social life has been a mixed bag.  Spending time with my roommates presents a potential challenge, but I hope we can maintain our friendship. Being away from my close friends back home is tough, but I know this is the best choice for my future, even if I miss them dearly.","The potential for conflict with my roommates is a concern. I am prioritizing open communication and compromise. My focus is on maintaining our friendship, and I’m willing to put in the effort to work through any disagreements we may have. I care deeply about my friends' happiness, even if it means making tough decisions, like supporting my friend's move to Florida.","The transition to university has been a little stressful.

While I didn't pursue any drastically new hobbies, the entire college experience itself was a huge shift from my previous life.  The initial excitement and hope for self-improvement were significant motivators, but the reality of persistent health issues dampened my enthusiasm somewhat.  Despite this, I'm still open to new experiences, albeit with a bit more realism and awareness of my limitations.","I've struggled to maintain consistency in managing my GERD. While I initially aimed for a healthy college lifestyle to solve this,  I haven't yet developed a reliable routine or strategies to manage my eating habits effectively. The ongoing challenge of my health issue often overrides any plans for self-improvement. The rewarding aspect is the hope that I'll find a solution, but the challenge is the consistent struggle to maintain it.","Meeting my college roommates was initially energizing; the prospect of making new friends was exciting.  However, their assumptions about my eating habits caused a significant drain. The lack of open communication and their quick judgments created a negative social experience. This interaction highlighted my need for understanding and acceptance from others, rather than assumptions and gossip.","The conflict with my roommates regarding my health has been difficult.  I prioritized understanding their perspective, but also needed to defend myself against their misconceptions. While I tried to approach it calmly, their lack of communication left me feeling frustrated.  I am generally agreeable, but I also value being understood and respect for my own experiences.","The stress of my health issue and my roommates' misunderstandings triggered significant anxiety.

It showed me I'm more open to new experiences than I thought.","I've struggled with procrastination, particularly with academic assignments. My time management is usually poor; I tend to cram at the last minute. I lack the sustained effort required for long-term projects.  However, when deadlines loom, I can focus intensely, albeit with considerable stress.  I find the pressure motivating, though this isn't a healthy or efficient approach.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy.

A memorable draining experience was a crowded party where I felt lost in the noise and unable to connect meaningfully with anyone. I realized that I recharge best through solitude and meaningful one-on-one connections rather than large, boisterous events.","I'm generally agreeable, but I do have moments of conflict.  In a disagreement with a roommate about cleanliness, I prioritized maintaining a peaceful living environment. I tried to discuss the issues calmly and compromise on cleaning schedules, focusing on finding a solution that worked for both of us, despite my frustration.","The constant drilling in my hallway significantly increased my anxiety levels.  My initial response was irritation and frustration, leading to difficulty concentrating.

I’m hoping to learn something new in the advanced class, but mostly I enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.  It’s a break from the pressure of my other classes.","I'm not the most organized person.  I have a lot of things on my to-do list, from finishing assignments to calling friends and making travel arrangements. I often rely on last-minute bursts of activity to get things done. While I want to make a 4.0, I struggle with sustained effort. I find it challenging to prioritize tasks effectively and stick to a schedule consistently.  The upcoming long weekend is a welcome break from this constant pressure.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  I find large parties overwhelming and prefer one-on-one interactions or small group hangouts.  I really need my alone time to recharge after even small social engagements. I value my close friendships and worry about maintaining those connections while balancing my academic and personal life.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize it rather than confront them directly. I prioritize maintaining harmony and good relationships. However, this sometimes means I avoid expressing my opinions honestly, which can lead to unresolved issues. I need to work on expressing my feelings more directly, but it's not always easy for me.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently; the pressure of school and all the other things I need to do makes me feel overwhelmed at times. My initial response is usually to procrastinate or withdraw. However, making plans with friends or just focusing on one thing at a time helps me manage my feelings and feel more in control. I look forward to relaxing during the long weekend to combat the overwhelming stress.",y,n,n,y,y
1079,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous or drawn to drastically new experiences.  However, starting college and living away from home was a significant change,  motivated by a desire for independence and a better educational environment than my high school offered.  While initially exciting, the adjustment was challenging,  and I still miss my friends and familiar surroundings.","Juggling a demanding course load, a significant research paper, and a long-distance relationship definitely required planning and discipline. I managed my time by creating to-do lists and prioritizing tasks, often working late nights to meet deadlines.  The rewarding part was the sense of accomplishment after submitting the paper, despite the stress.  The challenge was maintaining balance and avoiding burnout.","Spending time with my boyfriend, Michael, is generally energizing; we share similar interests and it's easy to connect and laugh together.  Being surrounded by my close friends in college is also energizing. On the other hand, large social gatherings, or having to interact with people I don't know well, can leave me feeling exhausted and needing some downtime.","Disagreements are something I try to avoid. I prefer to find common ground and value mutual respect, even if it requires compromising my own perspective.  If conflict arises, my priority is resolving it amicably and preserving the relationship rather than winning the argument. I tend to keep my feelings to myself unless I think it is necessary to share my side of the disagreement.","The pressure of college, coupled with the difficulties of a long-distance relationship (and my parents not letting me have my car), caused a significant amount of stress.  My initial reaction is usually to work harder until I feel that the issue is under control.  Talking to my boyfriend helped immensely; expressing my anxieties and worries made me feel better and enabled me to work through them.",n,y,y,n,n
1080,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new since starting college.  The biggest change has been living away from home and managing everything myself—laundry, cooking (mostly not cooking, ha!). It was a necessary change, motivated by the need to attend UT, and while it's been a bit of an adjustment, it hasn't been overwhelmingly different or exciting.","Getting to UT and keeping my grades up has required real effort.  I try to allocate time for studying and for my friends, but honestly I haven't been super organized.  I mostly just do what's needed when it needs to be done, which seems to work okay for now.  The biggest challenge has been balancing studying with my social life, particularly since I've met some really awesome women here.","Meeting Stephanie again and spending time with her over the weekend was incredibly energizing.  The interactions are easy and fun, and unlike past relationships, there's no long distance stress.  This contrasts sharply with the draining experience of my last relationship, which was difficult due to the distance and ultimately failed because of it. I clearly need a close, supportive friend in my life.","I haven't had any major disagreements yet, but I try to be agreeable.  I really value my friendship with Stephanie, and being in agreement with her is important to me. If a conflict were to arise, I’d prioritize maintaining the friendship while trying to find common ground.  Keeping people happy and pleased is a high priority for me.","I don't get stressed out easily.  Thinking about this psychology assignment makes me want to play video games instead, which might be my go-to stress reliever.  It's easy for me to avoid what I don't want to do. If a really stressful situation came up, I'd likely try to avoid it for as long as possible, and if I can't then I'd just focus on the task at hand.",n,y,n,y,n
1081,"I've always been fascinated by the natural world, particularly the colors of the sky.  One day, my friend burst my bubble by explaining the pollution causing the vibrant pink hues I'd been admiring.  While initially disappointed, it sparked a deeper exploration of art history – comparing modern skies to those depicted by Romantic painters like Delacroix and Turner. This led me down a rabbit hole of artistic interpretations of nature, and I've since become even more captivated by the interplay between reality and perception.","I'm not particularly goal-oriented in a traditional sense.  My creative pursuits, like exploring the nuances of color in nature and art, aren't structured projects with specific deadlines.  However, I maintain a certain consistency in my observations and reflections –  my exploration of these topics is ongoing, driven by curiosity rather than rigid planning. It’s more of a flowing, investigative process that I find rewarding in itself, rather than a structured project with specific goals to be met.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  The encounter described in my essay with my friend, where she dismissed my appreciation for the beauty of a polluted sky, left me feeling deeply frustrated. I crave intellectual connections with like-minded individuals, but casual, superficial exchanges feel cumbersome and ultimately unsatisfying. My preference is for solitary contemplation over large social gatherings.","I tend to be quite confrontational when I believe someone is wrong, even if it's a friend.  My disagreement with my friend about the beauty of the sky stemmed from a fundamental difference in perspective.  While I valued the aesthetic experience, she prioritized a factual scientific explanation.  Rather than compromising, my response was more defensive and argumentative, prioritizing my own interpretation.","I experience anxiety quite frequently. When my friend confronted my rosy perception of the sky's color,  my initial reaction was shame and defensiveness. I felt a profound sense of my own limitations in knowledge. To manage it, I retreated into my own thoughts, finding solace in artistic and historical parallels to process my emotions and intellectualize the situation.",y,y,n,n,y
1082,"I'm always trying to push my boundaries a little.  Starting this essay, writing in a language that isn't my first, felt like a huge leap outside of my comfort zone. It was motivated by the assignment itself, but also a desire to improve my English.  While it was definitely stressful, there’s a weird satisfaction in completing something difficult.","Getting a job is a huge goal of mine right now. I've been applying diligently, even though I haven't had much luck so far.  I’ve organized my applications and follow up calls, but it’s also been a struggle to stay motivated when I’m constantly facing rejection.  The challenge is maintaining that persistence, but the reward will be the independence that comes with having my own job.","Honestly, most social interactions drain me.  The phone call I mentioned in the essay—I dreaded it.  Even calls from people I like can be difficult because I value my quiet time so much.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings to large social events. This essay-writing experience was quite isolating, and that suited me just fine.","Conflicts are difficult. The essay shows some of my inner conflict and anxiety. I try to be understanding, but when I’m stressed, it can be hard to express my thoughts and needs clearly.  Avoiding conflict is generally my priority to maintain peace.","Writing this essay felt very stressful! The time constraint, the language barrier, and the uncertainty of my future all contributed.  My initial response was anxiety; I kept checking the timer, focusing on how much time was left. I tried to distract myself with other thoughts, and although I was internally stressing, I carried on by focusing on putting words to paper mechanically.",y,y,n,y,y
1083,"I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences. I prefer the familiar and comfortable. However, moving away from home to attend university was a significant change.  While initially apprehensive, I did find myself surprised by the sheer number of attractive women on campus. This unexpected influx of beauty, though initially daunting, has pushed me out of my comfort zone and sparked a desire for connection.","I struggle with consistent goal setting and follow-through.  Balancing studies, work, and my social life has proven challenging. I don't have specific strategies for time management; I often find myself overwhelmed and behind schedule.  My lack of structure is a significant source of stress, but the desire for a romantic relationship provides a motivator.","Large social gatherings drain me.  The large university setting, and especially living in an apartment with distant roommates, makes me feel isolated. I crave the comforting presence of my family, specifically my mother's reassuring presence.  This experience highlights my introverted nature and my need for close, intimate connections rather than large, boisterous social events.","I tend to avoid conflict.  The essay doesn't detail specific disagreements, but my desire to find a girlfriend suggests a willingness to compromise and build relationships despite my natural inclination towards independence. My past mistakes in relationships seem to have taught me the value of respecting others' feelings, even if I don't readily express my own opinions.","I experience considerable stress and anxiety stemming from being away from home, navigating university life, and my loneliness. My initial response is to withdraw and retreat into my thoughts, which include fantasies about finding a girlfriend. My coping mechanism seems to be daydreaming, but I also recognize the need to take action – to initiate conversations and actively seek out connections.",y,n,y,n,y
1084,"I decided to try stream-of-consciousness writing for this assignment, something completely outside my usual structured approach.  The professor's suggestion intrigued me, and I wanted to explore a different creative outlet. While initially disorienting, the experience was ultimately liberating; I found it oddly satisfying to let my thoughts flow freely, even if they meandered.","I haven't really set any specific long-term goals, at least not ones requiring meticulous planning.  My approach to tasks is generally more spontaneous.  While this essay assignment might seem like a goal, my efforts are more reactive than proactive. There is not much planning here; I'm just seeing where my thoughts take me. I found it challenging to stay focused, but the freedom from rigid structure was actually rewarding.","Being around people is energizing for me, but yesterday's class experience was more draining.  While I found the shared experience of suddenly realizing it was raining quite humorous, the overall situation, not the interaction, contributed to my exhaustion.  I think I appreciate interactions most when they're spontaneous and lighthearted and involve shared experiences, like yesterday's class, but not the stress that came with it.  I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one conversations.","I don't actively seek out conflict, but I find the observation of others' behavior fascinating.  I noticed people not sharing umbrellas, and I found that behavior strange rather than something I needed to resolve or influence. I am generally okay with observing, not engaging, when it comes to disagreement, and I am fairly indifferent to other people's actions.","The rain and the impending need to go home in it made me anxious. My initial response was a mix of amusement and concern (hence all the references to the rain).  I managed it by simply observing others' reactions, focusing on the humor of the situation, and trying not to dwell on the logistical challenges it created.  The feelings dissipated once the immediate challenge was past.",y,y,y,n,y
1085,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows how much I stick to my routine and familiar people.  The whole assignment of writing down my thoughts felt completely new and uncomfortable, and I found the experience more stressful than anything else. I only did it because I had to, I wouldn't seek this sort of thing out otherwise.","I struggle with long-term goals.  My essay is full of to-do lists and reminders showing my scattered mind. I don't have good time management skills, and often rely on last-minute actions. This leads to stress, as demonstrated by multiple mentions of needing to hurry. Staying on track is definitely a challenge for me.","Large social gatherings drain me.  The essay highlights my focus on close relationships with Lee, my sister, and certain friends (Kim and Arianna).  I seem to prefer smaller, intimate interactions over larger social events.  Noisy and busy situations overwhelm me.  The mention of playing online games while chatting shows how I try to reconcile my need for connection with a preference for my own space.","I generally try to avoid conflict. The essay expresses concern over my friends fighting, and frustration with situations beyond my control. I am generally a person who wants everyone to get along, even if they don’t, and my priority in conflict resolution is to maintain harmony and avoid confrontation, which is why I didn’t mention anything of the sort in my essay.","I am prone to anxiety and worry. My essay is a stream of consciousness full of anxieties, frustrations, and worries about many things (homework, social interactions, etc.). My initial response to stress is often to avoid it or focus on immediate needs, like eating or sleeping.  My many worries shows my tendency toward emotional reactivity and heightened anxiety, even in mundane situations.",n,n,n,y,y
1086,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Sticking to what I know is more comfortable.  The thought of trying something completely different fills me with anxiety, honestly. My focus is on getting things done, not exploring uncharted territory.","I'm pretty good at managing my time and responsibilities. My essay shows that—I've meticulously listed all my tasks, and I prioritize getting them done. It can be overwhelming, but breaking things down into smaller steps and creating checklists helps.  The reward is the feeling of accomplishment after ticking things off my list; the challenge is fitting everything in and the resulting exhaustion.","Social interactions often drain me. Large groups or extended conversations leave me feeling exhausted.  I prefer smaller, quieter gatherings or spending time alone. My ideal social situation would be brief and purposeful, not lengthy and unstructured.","I usually try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself unless it's absolutely necessary to speak up, and even then, I try to do so politely. Prioritizing peace and avoiding arguments is important to me; I simply don't have the energy for confrontation.","Feeling overwhelmed and stressed is a common experience for me.  When it happens, I usually just want to go home and sleep. My to-do list is often my source of stress, and it can be paralyzing. But I know that completing the tasks, even slowly, is the best way to reduce the anxiety.",n,y,n,y,n
1087,"I'm not typically one for radically new experiences.  My essay reflects that I'm more comfortable with familiar activities.  However, playing guitar with my dad, something we rarely do, was surprisingly fulfilling. It wasn't a dramatic shift in my life, but it opened a small window to a deeper connection I hadn't explored before.","I definitely struggle with procrastination.  My essay showcases this clearly, as I mention my struggles with homework.  However, when something truly matters to me, like improving my guitar playing, I'm more disciplined. While not always systematic, I find ways to carve out time, even if it’s spontaneous, like the session with my dad. I'm learning to balance my impulsivity with focused effort.","I'm definitely more introverted. Social interactions, even when positive like playing with my dad, often leave me feeling drained rather than energized. My essay shows how much I value alone time, and the desire for a close relationship stems from a longing for deep connection, not large social gatherings.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  When disagreements arise, my priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own views. My essay doesn’t detail specific conflicts but my desire for a relationship points towards a tendency to prioritize peace and understanding in interpersonal interactions.","I get anxious easily. The essay shows that I overthink a lot, focusing on negative self-judgments, uncertainty about college, and my self-worth. My initial response to stress is often self-doubt.  However, I try to shift my perspective by acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of my life, like my gratitude for my education.",n,y,n,y,n
1088,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try something completely new lately.  My life feels overwhelmingly focused on school, family drama, and trying to navigate this new chapter at UT.  Everything feels so pressured right now that exploring new interests just doesn't seem feasible.  I'm just trying to get through each day.","I’m definitely not the most organized person.  Trying to balance school, a part-time job (if I can find one), and family issues is a constant struggle. I often end up cramming for tests and turning in assignments at the last minute.  I wish I had better time management skills.  I know I could improve, but right now, just getting everything done feels like a huge victory.","Social interactions can be draining.  I tend to prefer smaller groups of close friends, but I’m struggling to build those connections here at UT. The sheer size of the university is overwhelming. I feel like I need to put more effort into socializing, but between school and family problems, I often withdraw rather than try to force social interactions.","I usually try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I often just keep quiet to prevent an argument.  If pressed, I'll express my opinion calmly, but my priority is maintaining peace and avoiding confrontation, especially with my family, whose constant interference adds to my already intense stress.","I'm extremely stressed out.  School is hard, my family life is chaotic, and my dating life is a complete disaster.  My initial reaction to stress is often to panic and overthink everything.  To cope, I try to keep busy, but that can be counterproductive, creating even more anxiety.  I know I need to find healthier coping mechanisms, but that's easier said than done.",n,n,y,y,y
1089,"I'm really enjoying my interpersonal communications class; it's opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about relationships and how to communicate effectively.  Before this class, I hadn't considered the many nuances of communication. The experience has been incredibly thought-provoking and enriching.  I'm excited to apply what I'm learning to my own life and relationships.","Balancing school and a potential full-time job while my boyfriend moves in is definitely a challenge. I haven't worked out a super structured plan yet, but I'm determined to make it work.  My immediate priority is to make this relationship work, and I’m willing to put in the effort even if it means some sacrifice in other areas. I figure I can figure out the details later.","Spending time with my boyfriend is always energizing; his presence makes me feel safe and excited about the future. I thrive on close relationships and being with loved ones.  Conversely, large social gatherings can sometimes drain my energy; I prefer more intimate interactions with people I know and trust.","I'm willing to make huge compromises for my relationship with Lamon, even if it means going against my parents' wishes.  My priorities are love and connection, so I'm willing to work through disagreements with my family to pursue what feels right to me, even if it means conflict.  I believe that love should conquer all.","The thought of losing my sister Vanessa is a huge source of anxiety for me. It stems from my dad's loss of his sister, something he's never really talked about. It's something I worry about a lot, and the thought itself triggers a lot of stress and anxiety. To manage my emotions, I try to focus on the present and remind myself that Vanessa is healthy and happy, and I am doing all I can to be there for her.",y,n,y,y,n
1090,"I haven't really sought out many novel experiences lately.  My focus has been entirely on academics and managing my weight, leaving little room for exploring new things. I suppose that’s a reflection of my current priorities, even if it's not necessarily something I consciously choose.","My primary goal is academic success. I meticulously plan my study schedule, allotting specific times for each subject and task.  I use to-do lists and calendars to stay organized, though lately the stress and anxiety have made it harder to adhere strictly to the plan.  The rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment when I complete a task, while the challenge is balancing my academic workload with the constant worry that fuels my self-doubt.","Social interactions tend to drain me.  Even casual interactions require extra energy, and I often find myself retreating to solitude to recharge.  While I value my few close relationships, large groups or superficial interactions leave me feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. This has reinforced my preference for quiet, introspective time over large social gatherings.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize it rather than confront them directly. My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own opinions. It's not always the most effective approach, but I find that this less confrontational method is generally more comfortable for me.","I experience significant anxiety related to academics, finances, and my body image. My initial response is often self-criticism and worry.  To cope, I try to engage in structured activities like studying or planning my day—it can be a helpful distraction. However,  these strategies are often insufficient, and I regularly experience high levels of anxiety.",n,y,n,y,y

I was motivated by a desire to escape my anxieties for a little while, and while I did have fun, it ultimately left me feeling more stressed the next day due to the hangover and the social awkwardness.","I'm not exactly a planner.  I tend to struggle with goals that demand sustained effort. My damaged car serves as a constant reminder of how I didn't properly manage my resources – I should've been more careful. Even when I tried to focus on fixing it, various other worries distracted me.",Social situations are generally draining for me. I found a recent party to be overwhelmingly uncomfortable and left me feeling exhausted. Too much small talk and forced interactions leave me feeling depleted. I’d rather spend time alone or with a close friend.,"Disagreements are difficult. Recently, I found myself clashing with my roommate; instead of confronting her, I let it linger because direct confrontation is uncomfortable for me. This is not a healthy approach but I prioritize avoidance over conflict.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  This morning's headache was a clear example of how my anxieties manifest physically. Usually I try to cope by avoiding situations that cause worry, but sometimes I use alcohol as a temporary coping mechanism.  This essay itself is born out of stress and anxiety – I want to clear up a difficult relationship situation.",y,n,n,n,y
1092,"Well, I wouldn't say I'm exactly the adventurous type.  I stick to what I know, which is probably why I haven't really tried anything drastically new.  The closest I can think of is going to a Longhorn football game – even though I’ve watched plenty on TV, being there was a different experience.  I didn't actively seek it out; it just happened.  It was fun, though.","I'm not the most organized person.  I worry about assignments and deadlines, as shown by my late-night ruminations on due dates. In the past, I'd meticulously check my backpack to ensure homework completion.  That shows a *desire* for conscientiousness, but the execution's a bit spotty.  I rely on sheer willpower and last-minute cramming.  The reward? Relief at meeting deadlines, but the stress is the bigger part of the experience.","Being at the Longhorn football game, or even watching the Spurs on TV, is really energizing.  Social settings like that give me a boost.  Large lecture halls, though, with 540 people… not so much.  I think it's about the intensity and scale of the social interaction.  Big, exciting events are great, but being in a huge, anonymous crowd is draining.","I haven't had many major disagreements, at least none that stand out to me.  My approach to conflict is likely avoidance or downplaying it. I don't describe any conflict in my essay, which suggests a lack of assertiveness or desire for confrontation.  I value avoiding trouble, even if that means compromising my own opinions, or avoiding open disagreement entirely.","I definitely worry a lot.  The homework assignment due date kept me up at night. The fear of failure is a big one, something that comes up often.  My coping mechanisms are less-than-ideal – I just dwell on it until I’m exhausted.  I lack effective strategies, but I recognize the problem and the distress it causes.",n,n,y,n,n

The whole ordeal with trying to switch my art history class for music appreciation was pretty much the extent of my venturing outside my comfort zone this week.

My goal this semester was to graduate and I meticulously planned out my course load.  I usually utilize planners and reminders but this whole art credit fiasco threw a wrench in my organized plan.  My challenge was the unexpected difficulty of switching classes, and that's something I'm trying to improve upon.",Large social gatherings aren't really my thing.  The most memorable social interaction lately was probably calling the music department and the college of education. Even those relatively brief phone calls left me feeling somewhat drained.  I think it's the added pressure of having to explain my situation and advocate for myself that makes it so exhausting.,"I tend to avoid direct conflict.  The disagreement with the office staff over adding the music class was stressful. I was polite but firm in explaining my situation. My priority was to get the credit I needed, and I wasn't confrontational, but also not easily swayed from my goal.","I'm prone to anxiety.  The whole scheduling fiasco completely overwhelmed me.

I prioritize my academic goals, and while I may procrastinate occasionally, I ultimately persevere.  The rewarding aspect is the accomplishment of completing the work, and the challenging part is overcoming unexpected obstacles.","Being at home in Houston with my family is a very energizing social experience for me.  Quiet time alone is also something I look forward to.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings rather than large, bustling social events. My enjoyment stems from connection and familiarity, not excitement or stimulation.","I haven't described any specific disagreements in my essay, but my overall tone suggests a willingness to accept things as they are. I prefer to focus on my own needs and experiences without explicitly mentioning conflict or disagreement. This preference for quietness is consistent with my agreeable personality.","My essay reveals a certain amount of impatience and frustration with technology, but I don't express significant anxiety or stress about it.

It wasn't necessarily a planned ""new"" experience, but thinking about the concept of multiple realities was a different way of thinking for me, even if I didn’t really dig into that thought as much as I’d hoped. Honestly, it was more of a random thought that popped up amidst the general social chaos, which is far more my style than anything overly planned.","Setting and achieving long-term goals? Not really my forte.  I'm more of a ""go with the flow"" kind of guy.  This assignment, however, was kind of different. I promised my roommates it would only take 20 minutes, so I did my best to stick to that.  No elaborate time management techniques here – just keeping an eye on the clock and trying to get the words down.  The biggest challenge was keeping focused enough to meet that self-imposed deadline.","That party this weekend was a memorable social experience. It energized me in a way, despite my rambling thoughts about the nature of reality. Being around people, even in a chaotic setting, is generally good for my energy levels.  However, if the social situation were more demanding or forced, I'd likely feel drained quickly.  I prefer less structured, more casual interactions.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet or change the subject. If the issue is important and I have to engage, I'll likely let the other person have their say and then offer my opinion in a relatively neutral manner, not overly prioritizing my own perspective to win the argument.  My priority is maintaining a level of comfort in the social exchange.","Stress and anxiety don’t really bother me, at least not in any profound way. I get these random thoughts, which might seem like anxiety to an outsider. But for me, they're just thoughts, and I don't let them get the better of me.

I had to prioritize my health while still managing to participate fully, requiring strict time management and self-discipline.  Even when feeling awful, I pushed through, demonstrating my commitment. It was incredibly challenging, but also incredibly rewarding to achieve my goal despite the obstacles.","The sorority rush process was both energizing and draining.  The initial excitement of meeting new people and the energy of the events was thrilling, yet the physical toll of my illness combined with the social demands of constantly putting on a brave face left me feeling exhausted. This experience helped me realize the importance of balancing social engagement with self-care.","Navigating the dynamics within my sorority, particularly the large group from the same high school, hasn't always been easy. I've prioritized maintaining positive relationships, focusing on understanding their established friendships while actively seeking to build my own connections within the group and with older members.  My main goal is inclusivity and creating a friendly atmosphere.","Having mono right before college made me incredibly anxious.  My initial response was fear—fear of missing out and fear of not being able to keep up.

This process helped me channel my anxiety into productive behavior.",y,y,y,y,n

New situations feel overwhelming, and I generally prefer to stick to what I know.","I'm not naturally organized, but I can be disciplined when necessary.  In the Army, sticking to a schedule was essential, and that habit has carried over somewhat.  I don't actively plan my day, but I do manage to meet certain requirements or expectations; for example, staying up late is a pattern I've created, and I generally stick to it.  While not rewarding in the traditional sense, the consistency provides a strange sort of comfort.","Social situations tend to drain me.  Large gatherings or prolonged interactions leave me feeling exhausted and irritable.  My time in the Army, while involving social interaction, often involved isolated stretches of time, which I preferred. I value my solitude and find that social contact is something to be endured rather than enjoyed; quiet evenings at home by the computer offer me the most energy.","I tend to avoid conflict.  Disagreements, particularly strong ones, leave me feeling uncomfortable.  I might try to minimize the issue or avoid direct confrontation, even if it means sacrificing my own opinion. I would much rather focus on avoiding conflict than engaging directly with someone I disagree with.","Stress and anxiety don't often affect me strongly.  I usually handle pressure by retreating into my routine, perhaps spending more time on the computer.  My time in the military probably helped me develop a tolerance for stress; the memories associated with the computer seem to help me deal with those situations. I can often find comfort in simple tasks or patterns.",n,y,n,n,n
1098,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences.  Staying close to home for college was a comfort zone choice, though switching majors was a small step outside that comfort.  While I feel I made the right choice for myself regarding my major, I don't generally go out of my way to try radically different things.  Novelty isn't a strong motivator for me.","Setting and achieving goals is important to me, though my approach isn't always methodical.  Changing my major was a goal requiring sustained effort to overcome parental objections.  I focused on clearly expressing my reasons, relying on my feelings and determination to push past their disapproval.  The rewarding aspect was achieving independence, while the challenge was managing the conflict with my family.","Social experiences are hit or miss.  Engaging conversations with friends are energizing, while encounters that feel superficial or judgmental, like interactions where girls seem closed off, are draining. It makes me realize I value genuine connection and dislike feeling misunderstood. I prefer those who are open and willing to engage in meaningful conversations.","Disagreements are difficult.  With my parents, I tried to be respectful but firm in my decision regarding my major change.  My priority was asserting my needs while minimizing conflict, though finding a balance between pleasing them and pursuing my interests was definitely a challenge.  I value harmony, but my own happiness and fulfillment are also essential.","Stress arises from situations beyond my control, like my academic performance relative to others and the Astros' poor season.  My initial response is frustration and a sense of unfairness, but I try to redirect that negativity by focusing on what I *can* control – my own actions and choices.  I might get worked up but will move on to focus on other things, eventually.",n,y,y,y,n
1099,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone is exhausting.  The summer English class was kind of new, I guess, but it was mostly just writing which I don't mind so much.  Mostly, I stick to what I know.","I'm not a very organized person, to be honest. Goals? I set them, but following through is tough.  I get overwhelmed easily, and I often procrastinate.  I'm pretty sure I'm not meeting my goals, but as long as I get by, it’s fine.  If I need something, like insurance or a working bank account, then I’ll take care of it but I wouldn't say I plan things out too much.","Large social gatherings completely drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  Being around a lot of people makes me anxious and tired.  I like spending time with close friends, but even then, I need alone time to recharge. I don't really initiate hanging out with people, usually I wait for them to contact me.","Disagreements are stressful.  I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, even if it means compromising my own needs.  I'm not very good at standing up for myself. If someone is being rude I'll probably just think about it and then say nothing.","Stress and anxiety are common for me.  I often feel overwhelmed, even by everyday tasks.  My initial response is usually to withdraw and avoid the situation, which isn't great, but it is what I do.  I’m learning to cope, I think.",n,n,n,n,y
1100,"I’m not really one for trying new things.  I much prefer the familiar and comfortable.  The only thing I can really think of that was new was taking Calculus in college, after having already taken it in high school. Even that wasn't really a choice; it was a requirement. I didn't exactly enjoy it, but at least I knew what to expect from my high school experience.","I struggle with staying on task.  My to-do list is constantly overflowing, and I often find myself distracted and procrastinating, especially when it comes to big projects like that 5-page research paper in psych. Keeping track of money is another challenge, as I mentioned spending more than I should have.  I clearly need to develop better organizational and time management skills.  The reward of accomplishing something, though, does give me a temporary sense of accomplishment.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I much prefer small, intimate settings with people I’m close to, like my boyfriend.  The anniversary is coming up, and I’m excited for that because it's a special time with someone I deeply care about. Being with him makes me feel energized and happy.  Being around my best friend also has a positive influence on me. Overall, I've learned that I value quality time over quantity.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and if I do find myself disagreeing with someone, I usually prioritize maintaining a positive relationship. I will try to find some common ground, even if it means compromising on my own views.  I value harmony and try to resolve disagreements peacefully. My boyfriend is important to me, and I don't want to upset him, so even if I'm frustrated, I try to make sure that he feels comfortable.","I tend to worry a lot.  The start of a new school year filled me with stress about my courses and upcoming assignments. My response is often to just keep thinking about all the things that I need to do, which makes me even more stressed out.  I often get overwhelmed thinking about everything I have to do and sometimes I just wish that things would slow down. To manage this, I usually talk to my boyfriend or my best friend, which often helps me feel a little bit better.",n,n,n,y,y
1101,"I've always wanted to learn belly dancing, and the thought of it has excited me for years. The motivation stems from a desire to try something completely different from my usual routine, something artistic and expressive.  I imagine the feeling afterward would be a mix of accomplishment and exhilaration, a sense of stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing a new skill.","I struggle with time management; my essay shows how overwhelmed I feel.  Setting and achieving goals isn't my forte, although I admire those who can do it.  I get involved in many things, but keeping track of deadlines and prioritizing tasks is a major challenge for me.  Even when I want to be organized, I find it difficult.","Being around my close friends is incredibly energizing, especially when we're supporting each other through life's challenges.  Meaningful connections fill my cup; shallow interactions or large crowds often drain me. This made me realize how much I value deep, supportive friendships over constant social stimulation.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation. When disagreements arise, I prioritize maintaining the relationship and understanding their perspective. My first instinct is to find common ground and work towards a resolution that preserves harmony, even if it means compromising on some personal opinions.","The feeling of being overwhelmed, as expressed in my essay, is a common experience for me. Initially, stress manifests as wanting to sleep or withdraw. To manage this, I try to express my feelings through writing (like my essay) which helps process and lessen the anxiety.  I try to find ways to relax and recenter myself when my thoughts get racing.",y,n,y,y,y
1102,"I haven't really tried anything *completely* new lately, not in a way that would drastically alter my perspective.  I'm pretty focused on my goals, which mostly involve academics and improving my social life. While I enjoy the challenge of learning new coding concepts, it's more incremental progress than a sudden, radical change.  That said, I did recently start working out more consistently, even though I initially disliked it.  It's less about enjoyment and more about the results and discipline it cultivates.","I'm aiming for top grades in all my classes, which requires juggling my studies, working out, and social life.  I usually plan out my week, trying to dedicate specific blocks of time to each activity. Sticking to the plan is the biggest challenge. My desire for free time in the future motivates me to buckle down and finish tasks.  Sometimes, even with careful scheduling, things don't go exactly as planned, and I find myself behind, but I try to catch up as quickly as possible. The reward is the feeling of accomplishment, and the promise of a better future.","A study session for computer science energized me.  The TA's poor English was a challenge, but I understood the material well enough that I could effectively help other students, which felt good.  I don't always enjoy large social gatherings or superficial interactions, but helping others, particularly in academic settings, feels rewarding and energizing.  These interactions show me that while I might prefer smaller, focused gatherings, I still enjoy connecting with people who share my academic goals.","I haven't had a major disagreement recently, but I am always aware of the people around me and want to maintain a cordial atmosphere. If a disagreement does arise, I prefer direct but polite conversation. My goal is to understand the other person’s perspective, even if I don't necessarily agree. While I can assert my opinions, I prioritize maintaining peaceful relationships and finding common ground whenever possible. I'm not looking for conflict.","The sold-out video game made me anxious and angry.  My initial reaction was frustration, which I addressed by focusing on my studies to distract myself.  I also use a form of mental trickery — reminding myself that I can just order it later, and that I have to keep my priorities straight.  This helps me manage my emotions by recognizing that my feelings are fleeting and that obsessing over them isn't productive.  Learning to compartmentalize is a skill I need to improve, but it helps me cope with stressors, particularly when I have lots of responsibilities.",n,n,n,n,y
1103,"I wouldn't say I've sought out wildly new experiences.  Coming to UT was a big change, though – a completely new environment and a huge step away from my family in Taiwan. While initially frightening, adjusting to the size and energy of the university has been surprisingly positive. It wasn’t something I actively *sought* out, more like something I bravely accepted.","Honestly, I haven't been the most organized person.  Managing my time and staying on track with my schoolwork is a constant struggle.  I haven't developed effective strategies for overcoming procrastination yet. I find the sheer volume of work challenging, but the rewarding part is knowing that my family’s support motivates me to work hard and build a good future.","Being around lots of people at UT, like in the cafeteria lines, has been strangely energizing!  I think it's the shared experience of being in a new place together.  Being with my family, on the other hand, is a different kind of fulfilling energy; it’s quiet and comforting. I'm learning that I can be energized in different ways, depending on the social setting.","I haven't encountered any major disagreements yet at UT.  I think I tend to avoid conflict; it’s easier to just go with the flow.  If a disagreement did arise, I'd likely try to find common ground and be respectful of the other person's perspective.  My priority would be maintaining a positive relationship.","Leaving home and starting college has been stressful, bringing waves of homesickness. I’ve mostly handled it by thinking about my family’s support and the reasons I came to UT – building a better future for myself and making them proud.  It's a comforting thought.  Focusing on my goals helps manage the anxiety.",n,n,y,y,n
1104,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things.  I prefer things that are familiar and comfortable. That said, joining a fraternity was a bit outside my usual routine, but it was mostly driven by a desire for social connection and a sense of belonging in college, which the essay reflects. While I have no regrets, it wasn't a spontaneous leap into the unknown so much as a calculated move to improve my college experience.","I’m not the most organized person.  The essay shows that I struggle with getting up for classes. While I value the freedom of college, maintaining a consistent schedule isn't my strong suit. Achieving goals requires external motivation or supportive environments, like the structure of a fraternity.  My success depends more on finding the right systems and surroundings than on strict self-discipline.","Being in my fraternity is a great source of energy for me. Social interaction, especially within my fraternity, is fulfilling; I thrive in situations with friends and people I know well.  The essay demonstrates a preference for this type of social interaction over other types, suggesting that large or unfamiliar social gatherings might be draining. The fraternity has helped me build stronger bonds and feel less alone in a new environment.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  In disagreements, I prioritize maintaining positive relationships.  While I might express my opinions (as seen in my critique of hazing in the essay), my goal is understanding, not necessarily winning an argument. I prefer harmony and would rather find a compromise to keep things peaceful and amicable than to push for my own perspective.","I don't tend to get overly stressed or anxious. I mentioned in my essay that I feel at ease in most situations.  Moving around a lot has likely taught me adaptability and resilience. Though I might have challenges (like waking up for class!), I tend to take things in stride and don't dwell on problems.  I approach stressful situations with a ""go with the flow"" attitude, as the essay demonstrates.",n,n,y,y,n
1105,"I'm always seeking out new experiences, even if it's just a new song or a different way to approach a writing task.  The stream of consciousness style of this essay itself was a departure for me; it was motivated by a desire to capture my thoughts as they flowed, unfiltered.  While it was initially challenging, the experience was ultimately freeing and allowed me to express myself in a more authentic way.","While I strive for consistency—like finishing this essay within the given timeframe—I don't always plan meticulously. I find structure helpful when focusing on specific goals, but I'm not rigidly bound by schedules.  My success in meeting deadlines depends on internal motivation and immediate interest rather than strict planning.  I often find that the most rewarding aspect comes from finishing something I'm genuinely interested in, even if it means deviating from a planned path.","Social interactions are something I'm wary of. The idea of a large, energetic gathering like a crowded club makes me uneasy—I prefer quieter, more intimate settings.  Large events leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed, whereas one-on-one conversations, or a smaller group of like-minded individuals (perhaps a film club meeting with the promise of food) is far more appealing. I recognize this preference and try to structure my social life accordingly.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid direct confrontation. I prefer to listen and understand the other person's perspective. Even if I disagree, I prioritize finding common ground rather than escalating the argument. I might express my dissent carefully, but my focus is usually on maintaining harmony, rather than proving a point.","I get anxious easily.  The cold room, the pressure of writing, the uncertainty of things—they all contribute to my general unease. When overwhelmed, I internally process my feelings, perhaps through music listening. I don't necessarily take active steps to manage anxiety immediately but instead attempt to shift my focus or find distractions until the feeling subsides.",y,y,n,n,n
1106,"I'm always up for trying new things.  For example, I recently started learning to play the guitar, even though I'd never considered myself musically inclined. I was motivated by a desire to express myself creatively and overcome a perceived limitation. While it's been challenging, I find the experience incredibly rewarding and satisfying.","I'm not the most organized person; structure isn't my forte.  I tend to work best under pressure, relying on bursts of intense focus rather than meticulous planning.  Procrastination is definitely a struggle, but the thrill of completing a task at the last minute is sometimes a motivation.  My lack of planning often creates challenges, but I somehow manage to get things done.","A recent Creed concert was incredibly energizing. Surrounded by like-minded fans, the shared excitement and enthusiasm were contagious. This experience reinforced my preference for social settings that offer shared excitement and strong emotional connections. I find smaller, more intimate gatherings draining compared to large, energetic events.","I don't shy away from disagreements; in fact, I can be quite confrontational. I prioritize expressing my opinions directly and honestly, even if it means creating conflict.  My approach to resolving disputes focuses on clearly stating my position and understanding the other person's perspective, but I'm not always successful at finding common ground.","I tend not to dwell on stress or anxiety.  When faced with pressure (like a looming deadline), I focus on the task at hand and try to push any negative emotions aside.  Sometimes this means distracting myself, like listening to music, and other times, it's about powering through until the task is complete.  I typically handle stress through productive activity and distraction.",y,n,y,n,n

It made me want to find more content like it, but I haven't found the time yet.","This writing assignment is a goal, I guess. I'm not really managing my time well; I'm procrastinating. I started it because I was bored, not because I had a plan.  I'm also distracted by my bad typing and all the other things I have to do today. I find it challenging to keep focused and rewarding to just get it done.","Going out with George last night was energizing. It was fun and easy.  Talking to friends online is also enjoyable, I find it less draining than trying to meet new people. I prefer smaller, close-knit groups to large social gatherings.","I haven't had any major disagreements recently. I try to avoid conflict. If I did have a disagreement, I'd probably just let it go; it's easier to go with the flow and not rock the boat.  I avoid being confrontational.","I get stressed easily, mostly from simple things like a bad-tasting throat or freezing temperatures.  I usually deal with it by fixing whatever is bothering me or just letting it pass.  Today it's mainly focusing on finishing this assignment to get it out of the way.",y,n,y,n,n

The thought of trying something new is exciting in my head, but the reality of doing it is daunting.","I set a goal to do well in college, but procrastination is my biggest enemy. I haven't implemented effective time management strategies; my social life often takes precedence over studying.  While I know I need to be more organized, the lack of motivation is a constant struggle. I find the thought of studying incredibly challenging and rewarding only when I get a good grade, which is not very often.","A recent social experience that left me feeling drained was a visit from my friends from home. While I love them, their presence made it harder for me to meet new people and settle into college life.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions. I crave a sense of belonging here, but the way I spend time with my current social group is not conducive to that.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid conflict and prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own views. I'll try to find common ground, but expressing my own opinion can be tough and I often don't speak up at all.","I felt particularly stressed and anxious at the beginning of college, feeling isolated and overwhelmed.  My initial response was avoidance; I spent a lot of time alone, which worsened my anxiety. I've tried to manage my emotions by distracting myself, like watching TV, but this isn't a healthy long-term solution and I know that.",n,n,n,n,y

The intricacy and originality sparked a deep appreciation for artistic innovation, something I hadn't fully experienced before.  It solidified my love for unconventional and challenging art forms.","I don't really plan things out that much. I'm more spontaneous.  I prefer to go with the flow rather than rigorously scheduling tasks and deadlines. While this approach is sometimes exciting, it can lead to missed opportunities or undone tasks, which I then have to deal with later. My lack of planning isn't a matter of laziness, but more of a preference.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy.  The Mexican band playing last night was overwhelming; the loud music and crowded space were just too much for me. I really prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can have meaningful conversations instead of dealing with a lot of surface-level interactions and noise.  This experience reinforced my need for quiet time to recharge.","Disagreements aren't something I often actively pursue, I tend to avoid conflict. While I might internally disagree with something, I'd usually stay quiet. I value harmony and avoid causing disturbances, so even if someone was wrong about something, I might not correct them. It really depends on the person and the subject; but I’m more likely to simply agree to disagree.","The constant noise and shallowness of television really bothers me.  It makes me anxious and irritable, bringing on a sense of feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. In those moments, I withdraw to find something more meaningful, like listening to music (Radiohead, of course) or focusing on my own thoughts.

I suppose joining the fraternity was something new, but I'm starting to question whether it was the right decision for me.  I’m not exactly embracing novelty at the moment.","Balancing fraternity life, schoolwork, and my social life has been a real challenge. I’ve tried to create a schedule, but it's hard to stick to with all the unexpected demands and events that come up.  I’m trying to improve my time management,  but it’s definitely a work in progress.  I find the constant demands and pressure frustrating, but I’m determined to stay on track with my studies.","I'm definitely an extrovert— I thrive in social situations.  Being in a fraternity is supposed to be about socializing, but lately, it feels more exhausting than fulfilling. I'm surrounded by people, but it feels superficial. I miss deeper, more meaningful connections. This experience has made me realize I need more balanced social interaction—less of the constant party scene and more meaningful connections with people I truly care about.","I generally get along with people.  Even with my roommates, who are also my friends from before college, we have surprisingly few conflicts. I prefer to avoid confrontations, and strive to find common ground. If disagreement arises, I try to communicate calmly and respectfully, focusing on understanding their perspective before trying to resolve the issue. This approach usually works well.","The death of my friend has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking.  Initially, I felt numb and struggled to process my emotions.

I've tried using planners and to-do lists, but I often find myself falling behind.  I set goals, like keeping up with my coursework, but staying on track consistently is a struggle.  Procrastination is a big problem for me, and it's been incredibly frustrating.

I tend to avoid direct confrontation and often try to find common ground, even if it means compromising my own views. I prioritize maintaining relationships, which sometimes means suppressing my own opinions to avoid conflict. I value harmony and peace above direct expressions of disagreement.","Feeling overwhelmed in college has led to a lot of anxiety. When stressed, I tend to withdraw and overthink things.

This psychology assignment is a rare exception; usually, I'd be scrambling at the last minute.  I haven't employed any time management strategies; frankly, I'm surprised I even started this early.  The lack of structure is both challenging and, strangely, somewhat liberating.","Large social gatherings drain me. The sheer diversity of this university is overwhelming.

The essay shows my interest in graphic design, which could be seen as a creative outlet, but overall, I prefer the known and predictable. The large class setting in the essay shows my discomfort with novel situations and a preference for smaller, more controlled environments.","I struggle with sustained effort and long-term goal setting.  My essay is somewhat disorganized and rambling, suggesting a lack of planning and follow-through.  Time management isn't my strong suit, and I tend to get sidetracked easily, jumping from thought to thought, as demonstrated by the many tangents in my writing.","I find large social gatherings draining and overwhelming, as evident in my reaction to the crowded classroom.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, even then I tend towards introspection and solitary activities.

I've broken the task down into manageable chunks, dedicating specific times to categorizing and adding new genres of music, ensuring steady progress. While this process is occasionally time-consuming, it’s rewarding to see the improvement in organization and the ease of finding the music I want to listen to.","Large social gatherings, like being surrounded by thousands of students at my new university, initially leave me feeling a bit overwhelmed.

For example, while I found the angry note left on the apartment manager's door humorous, I made an effort to consider her position, acknowledging that she likely faces numerous stresses.  While I can find humor in such situations, I recognize and attempt to empathize with others' experiences.","The extreme heat and my broken air conditioner caused significant stress and anxiety.

I use a planner and set realistic deadlines for tasks, breaking large projects into smaller, manageable steps. While it’s a challenge to stay on top of everything, the sense of accomplishment from completing a goal, no matter how small, is a great motivator and keeps me committed.","Most social situations leave me feeling drained. Large gatherings, especially, are overwhelming. I find smaller, more intimate settings much more fulfilling, perhaps because they allow for deeper connections and less pressure to perform or maintain energy for extended periods.  I prefer meaningful conversations with a few close friends to crowded, noisy events.","Recently, I had a disagreement with a sibling about the family home sale. My priority was to understand their perspective and to make sure that everyone felt heard and acknowledged. Although my own feelings were hurt, I tried to remain calm and focus on finding solutions that minimized further conflict.

I prioritize tasks based on urgency, often tackling immediate needs before long-term projects.  I tend to focus on fulfilling immediate responsibilities like studying for upcoming tests. While I appreciate the concept of sustained effort,  procrastination is a frequent struggle.","Large social gatherings, like concerts, can be draining.

I use planners to track assignments and deadlines. I've found that breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks and creating study schedules helps me stay on track.  The rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when I achieve a goal; the challenging part is the relentless effort needed to overcome my self-doubt.","Large social gatherings tend to exhaust me. A memorable social experience that drained me was the first day of school, surrounded by new faces and overwhelming interaction. The sheer number of people was overwhelming. I crave quiet time to recharge after social interaction, and I think my tendency toward introversion helps me to avoid those draining situations.","I often find myself disagreeing with people, particularly those who think they know everything.  Instead of confrontation, I tend to keep my disagreements private or express them in a sarcastic, indirect way.  I value maintaining a sense of self-respect over forcing agreement, as it seems to lead to more problems than it solves.","Stress and anxiety manifest as mood swings and self-doubt. When I'm overwhelmed, I initially withdraw.  To manage my emotions, I might read or listen to music—anything to distract myself and find a sense of control in the chaos. Humor also helps; making light of things, like Rosanne Barr does, makes difficult situations a little less daunting.",n,y,n,n,y
1118,"I’m always looking for new experiences.  Starting college was a huge one for me—a completely new environment and a chance to be myself, away from the constraints of my long-distance relationship. While initially exciting, the sheer number of attractive women has been both exhilarating and overwhelming, posing a challenge to my relationship. I find myself drawn to exploring new social situations and embracing the unknown aspects of this chapter in my life.","Balancing my college life, my long-distance relationship, and my desire for freedom has been difficult. I’m not always the most organized person, but I try to make time for my responsibilities. However, my focus often wavers, and managing my time effectively remains a constant struggle. My procrastination is a clear weakness, and the conflicting desires between my girlfriend and the new opportunities present a major conflict. I tend to struggle with commitment and maintaining consistent effort towards long-term goals.","Being at college is incredibly energizing.  Surrounded by new people, especially women,  I thrive on the social interactions.  The constant stimulation fuels my energy, and I am quite confident in social situations. However,  managing the demands of a long-distance relationship while enjoying my newfound freedom can be draining.  I value social connections, but my need for autonomy and freedom often creates conflict with my commitment to my girlfriend.","I’m not always the best at handling disagreements; often I avoid confrontation. I tend to downplay issues to avoid conflict. While my relationship creates many disagreements, I prioritize maintaining the peace (and avoiding honesty) to keep her happy, even if it means compromising my own needs and desires. I value her feelings greatly, sometimes to my detriment.","I get stressed easily, especially when my eyelids get heavy. College life is stimulating and engaging, but the pressure of maintaining a long-distance relationship while simultaneously navigating new social dynamics can create anxiety. The physical pain stemming from my accident also contributes to this; it is a constant reminder of past trauma. I often manage this by avoiding the issue, or by distracting myself with other things, such as flirting or eating a cheeseburger.",y,y,y,y,n
1119,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Sticking to what I know is more comfortable for me. The thought of trying something completely new fills me with a sense of unease, frankly.  I prefer routine and predictability.","Honestly, meeting deadlines has always been a struggle.  I often find myself overwhelmed and behind, especially with school work.  I try to manage my time, but it rarely works as planned, leading to stress and feeling even more behind.  The whole thing is just a constant source of frustration.","Social situations are generally draining for me.  Large gatherings or events exhaust me quickly. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well. I need plenty of alone time to recharge.  Spending too much time socializing leaves me feeling depleted and irritable.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I usually try to avoid conflict, even if it means compromising my own opinions.  My priority is maintaining peace and avoiding confrontation, even if it means I’m not entirely happy with the outcome. I find confrontation stressful and energy-draining.","The past couple of weeks have been intensely stressful, and it's been impacting my sleep and schoolwork.  I feel constantly tired and worn out, even though I'm sleeping a lot.  The stress is making it difficult to focus, and I'm worried I'm falling behind.  I'm hoping things will improve as the semester progresses, but right now, I feel quite overwhelmed.",n,n,n,n,y
1120,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows my mind jumping from one thought to another –  a reflection of my chaotic internal landscape, not a desire for novel experiences. Sticking to the familiar feels safer and less overwhelming.","Sustained effort?  Not really my forte. The essay's stream-of-consciousness style speaks volumes; my thoughts are all over the place, and I don't often stick to plans.  I tend to get sidetracked easily and don't prioritize well, often leading to unfinished projects.","Social situations often leave me drained.  As the essay reflects, I'm more comfortable with my own thoughts and anxieties.  Large groups or prolonged interactions are exhausting. I value the solitude to process my often overwhelming thoughts.","Disagreements? I tend to avoid direct conflict. The essay hints at this; I internalize my feelings rather than expressing them directly. Maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own opinions, is generally my priority.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  The essay's chaotic nature is a direct result of this. My internal world is often turbulent, and I struggle to manage my emotions constructively, leading to overwhelming feelings and scattered thoughts.",n,n,n,n,y
1121,"Last summer, I decided to try waiting tables at Pappasito's.  I'd never worked in a restaurant before, and the idea of interacting with so many different people was both exciting and a little intimidating.  It turned out to be a really positive experience; I met lots of new people, gained new perspectives, and even learned more about myself.","This semester, I'm juggling four demanding architecture classes alongside a psychology course.  Managing my time effectively involves detailed planning and prioritization – I create weekly schedules, allocate specific time blocks for each task, and break down large projects into smaller, manageable steps.  Staying committed is challenging, particularly when late nights are inevitable, but knowing I'll eventually complete my projects keeps me going.","Working at Pappasito's was a very energizing social experience.  The friendly atmosphere, the constant interaction with coworkers and customers, and the opportunity to make new connections all contributed to my positive feelings. It reinforced my preference for social interaction and helped me understand the importance of having a supportive network of friends.","I haven't described any specific disagreements in my essay, but my concern for my best friend's social isolation suggests a desire for harmony and to understand different perspectives.  Even though she's prioritizing her relationship, I understand it and try not to hold it against her.  My priority is to maintain our friendship, even if it means accepting her current level of interaction.","Starting this semester with such a heavy course load definitely caused some stress and anxiety.  My initial response was to feel overwhelmed, but I quickly implemented coping strategies like creating detailed schedules and breaking down large tasks. While I acknowledge that I still get stressed, I am aware that I am capable of completing my workload.",y,y,y,y,n
1122,"The biggest leap outside my comfort zone was starting college at UT.  While only three hours from home, it felt like a massive shift towards independence and self-discovery.  The motivation stemmed from a desire for a fresh start and the chance to become whoever I wanted to be. The experience, so far, feels both exciting and slightly daunting, a mix of exhilaration at new opportunities and some underlying anxiety.","My goal was to succeed at UT despite the distractions. I haven’t established any concrete strategies yet, but the stories of others failing pushed me to avoid that path.  Staying on track is a daily challenge; it involves resisting temptations and reminding myself of the investment in my education.  The rewarding aspect is the self-improvement; the challenge is maintaining focus in such a stimulating, yet distracting environment.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  The sheer scale and energy of college life can be exhausting.  I'm learning to manage these feelings by strategically choosing my social engagements and prioritizing my need for solitude to recharge.","I haven't encountered major disagreements yet, but observing friends' struggles with the college environment sometimes leads to unspoken conflict. While I support them, I also need to respect their choices, even if I don't fully agree with them. My priority is to be supportive but also maintain my own path.","Leaving home and starting college triggered a lot of anxiety.  My initial reaction was worry about my parents and the pressure to succeed. I cope by focusing on my goals, connecting with supportive friends, and reminding myself of my capabilities.  The stress isn't entirely negative; it motivates me to work harder and prove myself.",y,n,n,n,y
1123,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone. For example, last semester I decided to join the university's jazz band, even though I'd only played trombone casually before. The motivation was simple: I wanted to improve my skills and meet new people. While the initial rehearsals were challenging, the experience of performing with the band was incredibly rewarding, and I made some great friends in the process.","I'm definitely not the most organized person, but I do my best to achieve goals if they are important enough.  This semester, I set a goal to get straight As, which demanded time management, especially with my busy social life and musical activities. To stay on track, I prioritize completing my assignments early and make sure that I have enough time to study. However, procrastination sometimes creeps in, especially when I get distracted by my friends or my trombone playing, but generally speaking I am a responsible person.","I thrive in social situations, especially when surrounded by interesting people. A memorable experience was a concert at a local jazz club. The energy of the crowd and the musicians created an electric atmosphere that left me feeling invigorated and connected. On the other hand, I find large, impersonal social gatherings draining; I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I know and enjoy talking to, such as my friends and fellow musicians.","I'm not always the most agreeable person, but I try to treat people with kindness. Recently, I had a conflict with someone about a music project.  Initially, I had a very defensive attitude but I knew that to ensure a successful collaboration I should not let the disagreement hinder our progress.  I tried to find a middle ground, prioritizing a positive outcome over winning the argument. While it wasn't easy, I believe we reached a solution that worked for both of us.","I can get anxious and stressed, especially when I feel overwhelmed by my responsibilities. If the pressure mounts, I'll become irritable.  For example, before a big performance, I sometimes get really stressed. To manage this, I take a deep breath and try to put things into perspective. Sometimes I will also listen to music which helps me to relax.  I have learned that a calm attitude and preparedness are crucial to handling stressful situations well.",y,y,y,n,n
1124,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try anything drastically new lately.  My life feels incredibly overwhelming and stressful right now.  Everything feels like a struggle, and honestly, the thought of doing something completely new just adds to my anxiety. I'm focusing on getting through the immediate challenges instead of exploring new things.","I'm trying to stay on track with my schoolwork, even though it feels almost impossible. I've created a basic schedule, but it's more of a guideline than a strict plan. Staying committed is a major struggle. I get easily distracted and overwhelmed.  The biggest reward would be finishing this semester and the biggest challenge is dealing with the constant anxiety and lack of sleep.","I find most social interactions draining.  Right now, I'm just focused on my schoolwork and trying to survive the semester. Even the thought of interacting with others feels like a monumental task. The idea of socializing makes me even more anxious. My social needs are practically non-existent right now.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I'm in disagreement with someone, I tend to withdraw or keep my opinions to myself.  Maintaining peace and avoiding arguments are my priorities, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.  Confrontation brings about more stress that I really don't have the energy for right now.","I'm incredibly anxious right now.  My immediate response to stress is to feel overwhelmed and exhausted.  I try to manage my emotions by distracting myself, but honestly, it's not very effective.  It's a constant struggle to keep my anxieties from consuming me.",n,y,n,n,y
1125,"I wouldn't say I'm one for trying radically new things.  The essay reflects my tendency to stick to what's familiar and comfortable.  While I transferred to UT Austin, that was more about practical considerations than a thirst for novelty.  My contentment with the familiar is probably why I'm currently struggling to find motivation to study new material at the library.","I'm not the most organized person; my essay shows that I struggle with procrastination.  While I mentioned keeping up with my studies, the fact that I’m at the library at 8:50 pm on a Sunday suggests I haven't been particularly successful at managing my time. I rely on external pressures, like needing to use a computer, to get things done.  The goal of getting through college is a long-term one, and I haven't developed strong strategies for staying on track.","Spending time with my family is very fulfilling. That visit energized me even though the context involved facing difficult family health concerns.  Conversely, I probably feel drained if I'm forced to spend too much time alone or in settings requiring extensive small talk. This reflects my preference for close relationships and deep connections rather than large, boisterous social gatherings.  My strong relationship with Mark is central to my well-being.","I tend to avoid conflict.  My essay doesn't detail any specific disagreements, highlighting my preference for harmony in my relationships. When faced with difficult topics, such as the health of my grandmother and grandfather, my approach is to accept things and provide support to the family. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships and avoiding any disruption to that.","My anxieties about my family’s health are evident in the essay. My initial response to stress is to worry and overthink.  I manage my emotional response by focusing on practical matters (being at the library), spending time with loved ones, and seeking comfort in my relationship with Mark.  The essay shows that while anxious thoughts abound, I have supportive coping mechanisms.",n,n,y,y,y
1126,"I once decided to take up competitive ballroom dancing. It was completely outside my usual comfort zone, motivated by a desire to challenge myself and try something utterly different.  While I was initially terrified, the experience was ultimately rewarding, expanding my social circles and pushing me physically and mentally.","My goal was to finish writing my honors thesis on time, which required intense focus and meticulous organization.  I utilized a detailed schedule, breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and rewarding myself for milestones reached.  Staying committed was challenging at times, especially during writer's block, but the satisfaction of completing the thesis on schedule made it worthwhile.","A large party left me feeling utterly drained. The constant noise and superficial conversations were overwhelming, highlighting my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends. This experience solidified my understanding of my introverted nature and the importance of prioritizing quality over quantity in social interactions.","I had a significant disagreement with a professor regarding a grade. Rather than escalating the argument, I calmly explained my perspective, highlighting the evidence supporting my position. My priority was a fair and just resolution, not winning the argument, and eventually we found a compromise that was acceptable to us both.","When facing a particularly challenging deadline, I initially felt overwhelmed and anxious. To manage these feelings, I prioritized self-care, exercising, and engaging in relaxing activities.  This holistic approach helped me to regain perspective and tackle the situation effectively.",y,y,n,n,y

Honestly, even researching the occipital lobe for my class feels a bit outside my comfort zone.","Getting my vision back after the accident was a long-term goal.  I meticulously followed doctors' instructions, scheduled regular checkups, and patiently persevered through frustratingly slow progress.  It was challenging to remain optimistic, but knowing that consistency was key kept me focused.  The gradual improvement is deeply rewarding.","Large social gatherings exhaust me.  I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending a lot of time with people drains my energy, reinforcing my preference for quiet solitude.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually try to understand their perspective first, even if I don't necessarily agree with it.  I prioritize maintaining a calm and respectful environment, even if it means compromising on my own point of view.","The car accident and the subsequent uncertainty about my vision were incredibly stressful.

I utilize a detailed planner and break down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks to stay organized. While there are times I struggle to maintain perfect focus, my dedication helps overcome challenges and makes the accomplishment all the more fulfilling.","A recent dinner with my best friend Desiree was incredibly energizing. Our shared history and effortless connection make spending time with her easy and joyful.  This highlights my preference for close, meaningful relationships over large social gatherings.","I usually try to understand where others are coming from before expressing any disagreements. If a conflict does arise, I prioritize open communication and finding common ground to resolve the situation amicably. Maintaining positive relationships is important to me.","When stressed, I tend to overthink and worry. To manage this, I rely on my belief in fate and remind myself that things happen for a reason.

The essay reflects my internal questioning, but not necessarily an outward exploration of unfamiliar things.

While I haven't described specific time management techniques, my ambition to build my own company shows a dedication to long-term planning and hard work. Overcoming obstacles will be a key part of this, which requires conscientious effort.","I'm energized by big ideas and ambitious goals, more so than by typical social interactions.  While I observe others, the essay shows my focus is on internal thought processes and planning, rather than outward social engagement.  My energy comes from the pursuit of my vision.","I'm not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, as evidenced by my critique of the college system in the essay.  While I don't explicitly describe conflict resolution, my independent nature suggests I'm more focused on pursuing my own path, even if it means diverging from others' expectations.","The essay doesn't express significant anxiety or stress.  My questioning of societal norms could be interpreted as an internal conflict, but it's more of a thoughtful contemplation than a state of heightened anxiety or emotional distress. My focus is more on strategic planning than emotional reaction.",n,y,y,y,n

Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit; I'm much more inclined to react to things as they come, rather than plan ahead.  Structure feels restrictive to me.  I may start something with good intentions, but sustaining effort over time is definitely a challenge.","I enjoy social interaction, particularly when it involves a lively group of friends and energetic conversations. I feel energized by shared experiences, laughter, and a sense of camaraderie. Quiet, introspective time is essential to re-energize after an extroverted burst.  Being around people for too long can be draining.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, and I usually avoid direct confrontation.  I might try to smooth things over or simply back down rather than engaging in a debate.  Maintaining harmony is a high priority, even if it means compromising my own point of view.  I prefer to avoid conflict wherever possible.","I tend to worry a lot.  When faced with stress or anxiety, my initial response is often panic or intense worry. To manage my emotions, I sometimes isolate myself, trying to distract myself by watching movies or listening to music.  However, dealing with anxiety constructively is a constant struggle.",n,n,y,n,y

My lack of a concrete degree plan shows that. I have strong feelings about my relationship, but my lack of structured plans for my future reflects a certain lack of organization and planning in my life, overall. I often get distracted or lose motivation when things get challenging, preferring to focus on what feels good in the present moment.","Social situations are often draining for me, rather than energizing.  Spending time with large groups of people leaves me feeling depleted.  I find it much easier to connect with one or two close friends rather than a larger crowd.  The essay shows I value close relationships, but large social events are not my preference.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I usually try to avoid conflict altogether, which isn't always the healthiest approach.  If pressed, I might express my opinion, but I usually prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means compromising my own needs or perspectives. In the essay, I mention that I avoid confronting the roommate.","I experience anxiety quite frequently, especially regarding uncertainties about the future.  My thoughts about potential relationship outcomes and career choices highlight this, and that tends to lead to obsessive thoughts.

My essay reflects my tendency toward impulsivity and distraction, making sustained effort extremely challenging. Any attempt at organization or planning is easily disrupted by my anxieties and internal conflicts.

The trip to Chile to ski bum for a season is a departure, but it’s based on a long-held desire, not a sudden craving for something completely unfamiliar.  It feels more like a natural progression than a bold leap into the unknown.","I'm not the most organized person.  The deadline for my application to Chile stressed me out a lot. While I'm excited about the trip, I haven't meticulously planned everything.  I tend to handle things as they come up, sometimes leading to last-minute rushes.  Getting that speeding ticket only added to the chaos!","Spending time with Kaylee is incredibly energizing.  It’s easy to talk to her and feel a connection.  Being around others can be draining, and I need alone time to recharge after social interactions.  Surfing is another activity that is energizing, as it gets me away from others and allows me to focus on myself. I appreciate quality time with those close to me more than large groups.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I try to find a way to agree to disagree or to understand their viewpoint.  My priority is maintaining good relationships.

My plan to catch up involves setting aside specific time slots for studying, breaking down the workload into manageable chunks, and resisting the urge to procrastinate. I know I have the self-discipline to succeed, but it definitely requires constant focus and a good strategy.","Last night's party was draining.  While I enjoy socializing, the environment was overwhelming and didn't align with my preferences; I felt pressured to engage in behaviors that weren't authentic to myself. This reaffirmed my need for smaller, more intimate gatherings with people whose company truly energizes me.","I often find myself in situations where my opinions differ from others, especially regarding social interactions and expectations. I try to approach disagreements with empathy, understanding their point of view before voicing mine.

However, I do value honesty and commitment in relationships, which is why I felt such intense guilt after my encounter with Damian. I’m not always successful at managing my time or resources effectively, but the consequences of my actions are a stark reminder of why self-discipline is important to me.","Social interactions can be draining, especially when I’m trying to hide something.  Writing this feels like a safe space to examine my feelings, rather than engaging in more face-to-face conversations. I strongly prefer intimate connections over large groups; in fact, I avoid social settings when I can. My interactions with Michael and Damian highlight my need for emotional intimacy, even if I’m not always successful in communicating my feelings.","I value honesty, even if I struggle to be honest. My internal conflict about telling Michael about Damian shows that.  I prioritize maintaining the relationship with Michael, which is why I haven't confessed. Despite valuing honesty, fear of conflict and potential loss overrides my commitment to complete transparency.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress; the situation with Damian has intensified these feelings.

I had to settle for something new this year. I generally prefer familiar routines and places.","I'm not the most organized person.  My family's vacation plans were a complete mess. We changed locations several times before finally settling on California. I don’t really prioritize planning and staying on track.  Honestly, the spontaneity was kind of exciting, in a chaotic sort of way. The resulting trip was fun, but I wouldn't call it ""well-planned"".","I had a great time visiting my nieces and nephews in California.  Spending time with family is energizing for me, and I have a good time when I'm with them. I do get a bit worn out by large, extended family gatherings, though.

I'm not one to shy away from expressing my opinion, and I really believe that she needs to change.","I'm generally pretty relaxed, but even I get stressed out sometimes.

I manage this through meticulous planning, creating detailed weekly schedules, and prioritizing my studies above most other activities.  Challenges arise from the difficulty of certain classes, like chemistry, but I combat these with consistent study sessions and seeking help when needed. The rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment and self-assurance that comes with meeting my academic targets.","Most social experiences drain me.

If a disagreement arises, I tend to withdraw or find ways to minimize the confrontation. My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own views.  This approach works well for me, as I prefer to manage my own internal reactions rather than engaging in extended arguments.","When I feel stressed, like the pressure of achieving a 4.0 GPA, my initial response is a slight anxiety and tendency to overthink.

This proactive approach, even for a distant event, helps me avoid potential setbacks.  The challenge is mostly the logistical coordination, while the reward is knowing I’m taking care of things responsibly.","Social interactions tend to drain me.  The party where the stabbing occurred underscores this; while it was a social setting, it resulted in a sense of unease rather than exhilaration.

Afterwards, it was a mixed bag.  The game itself was enjoyable, but the guilt over missing class overshadowed it.","I usually pride myself on academic excellence.  To stay on track, I generally rely on setting alarms and making plans. However, as evidenced by missing my BA101 class, I sometimes fail to follow through on those plans. The missed class is a clear example of my struggle with time management, although I am motivated to make up for my mistake through extra credit.","I tend to prefer smaller, more intimate social settings. Spending time with my friend getting a virus scanner and playing video games was enjoyable because it was a relaxed, one-on-one interaction.  Large, noisy gatherings drain me. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller groups of friends.","I'm usually pretty agreeable, but the seemingly arbitrary grading system in my BA101 class frustrated me.  I don't like feeling my effort isn't properly recognized. I would generally try to discuss my concerns constructively with the TA or professor, but this reflects more of my tendency towards introversion in this particular situation.","Missing class caused significant stress and anxiety, particularly because I value academic success. I responded initially with self-blame and then sought to alleviate this with reassurance and distraction (the video game).  Focusing on making up the missed work and securing extra credit helped me constructively manage my emotions.",y,y,n,y,y
1140,"I haven't had many opportunities to try something drastically different.  My life is pretty structured, and I prefer routines. However, pledging a sorority was a significant departure from my usual comfort zone. Although I was nervous, I was motivated by the prospect of new friendships and experiences, and ultimately, it was a positive, albeit somewhat overwhelming, experience.","I set a goal to improve my academic performance, particularly in my challenging science courses. To stay on track, I created a detailed schedule, utilized resources like tutoring and study groups, and prioritized assignments.  Staying committed was challenging at times, especially when juggling social activities, but the feeling of accomplishment from consistently meeting my goals was very rewarding.","I find large, loud parties draining. They're overwhelming and leave me feeling depleted. Quiet, meaningful conversations with close friends, however, energize me. These interactions reinforce my preference for deeper connections over superficial social gatherings.","I value harmony in relationships, so when disagreements arise, I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective before stating my own. My approach involves calm communication and finding common ground, rather than focusing solely on being ""right.""","I can become anxious when faced with uncertainty, particularly regarding my future plans. My initial response is often worry, but I try to manage it through prayer and focusing on what I *can* control – my actions and efforts – rather than fretting over what’s unknown.",n,y,n,y,n
1141,"I’ve never been one for trying new things, always preferring the familiar.  However, college has thrown me into a completely different environment, forcing me to adapt.  The sheer challenge of keeping up with my studies, something I actively avoided in high school, is the motivation behind this change. While it's been stressful at times, the feeling of accomplishment after completing challenging assignments is surprisingly rewarding.","Getting a 4.0 this semester is my biggest goal. I'm managing my time by planning my study sessions in advance and sticking to a schedule, even on weekends.  I used to avoid work, but now I proactively seek it out.  Staying committed is a challenge, especially with the many distractions of college life, but the desire to achieve my goal outweighs the temptations.","Social situations in college have been both energizing and draining.  Energetic gatherings with friends fuel me, while large, impersonal parties leave me feeling depleted. I crave genuine connections over superficial interactions, so I’m more selective about my social engagements now. I realize I need a balance between social interaction and alone time to stay energized.","I haven’t had many major disagreements in college yet, but I value understanding others’ perspectives.  If a conflict were to arise, my priority would be to listen to the other person before stating my own viewpoint to find common ground. I’m not one to easily back down from what I believe is right, but respectful communication is key.","The pressure of college has been stressful at times. My initial response is usually to withdraw and overthink, but I'm actively trying to manage it by focusing on smaller goals. I find writing helps, allowing me to process my thoughts and anxieties constructively. College has pushed me to develop better coping mechanisms.",n,y,y,n,n
1142,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  The scholarship dinner was probably the closest thing to stepping outside my comfort zone recently, and even then, it felt more like an obligation than a deliberate exploration of something new. I felt awkward and out of place amongst the other high-achievers.  Overall, the experience reinforced my preference for familiar routines.","I struggle with procrastination, as evidenced by my late submission of this assignment. While I set goals, following through consistently is a challenge. I often start multiple tasks simultaneously and rarely apply effective time management techniques. Despite my awareness of this flaw, I haven't implemented strategies for improvement yet. However, I do value completing tasks, ultimately, and find the sense of accomplishment rewarding once I get something done.","Social situations generally leave me feeling drained. The scholarship dinner, while obligatory, showcased this perfectly.  I prefer smaller, intimate gatherings to large, formal events. Being surrounded by so many strangers, especially those who seemed exceptionally accomplished, made me feel self-conscious and overwhelmed. It's not that I dislike people, but extensive interaction is emotionally taxing.","Disagreements make me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid direct confrontation and often prioritize maintaining harmony over expressing my own opinions forcefully.  If conflict arises, I usually try to find common ground or subtly shift the conversation to a less contentious topic. I'm not assertive by nature and tend to avoid potentially tense situations.","I experience a good deal of anxiety.  The essay writing process itself was particularly anxiety-provoking, highlighted by the constant leg-shaking I experience when nervous. My initial response to stress is often self-doubt and worry, though I try to counteract these feelings by reminding myself of my strengths and achievements. While I acknowledge that many stress-reduction techniques, are useful, I don't regularly implement them.",n,y,n,n,n

And afterwards?  It just left me more confused than before.","Goals?  Honestly, I haven't really had any long-term goals. My focus has been almost entirely on Jessica.  My “strategy” was mostly impulsive reactions.  It was definitely challenging, mostly because I wasn’t even sure what I wanted. And rewarding?  Not really, not in the long run.","Social experiences?  Generally draining.  Being around people takes a lot out of me. This whole Jessica thing was…intense, but not in a good way. It confirmed that I am not exactly a social butterfly. I much prefer my own company.","Disagreements? Yeah, constantly with Jessica. I tried to play games to get what I wanted, which wasn't very agreeable. My priority was getting her to pay attention to me, and that didn't involve being particularly nice.","Stressed and anxious?  Almost constantly.  My initial reaction is usually to overthink everything.  To manage it, I just…try to distract myself or get into a power struggle. It rarely works, but it’s something to do.",n,n,n,n,n

I suppose joining the broadcast team for the volleyball game is a step outside my comfort zone, but it’s more about getting involved than trying something wildly different.","Balancing schoolwork and my social life has been a real challenge. My roommate is a great influence, pushing me to attend meetings and stay on top of things.  I do sometimes procrastinate, and worry about my grades, but I try to manage my time by prioritizing assignments and setting deadlines for myself. I’m also trying to be more involved, and the broadcast work might help me to better manage my time.","Going to the frat party tonight is a big decision. I am an extrovert, and I generally enjoy social interactions. However, big parties can be overwhelming sometimes, and depending on the energy of the people there, I can be drained.  I think a good balance is important; close friends are energizing and positive interactions with new people can be fun, but large, loud groups can exhaust me quickly.","I haven't had any major disagreements here yet.  I think that I am generally agreeable, and I try to approach conflict by listening to others' viewpoints and looking for common ground.  My focus is generally to keep things friendly and avoid confrontations.","Starting college has definitely been stressful and anxiety-inducing. I miss my friends and boyfriend from Houston, and the familiar comfort of my old life. I've been feeling overwhelmed and confused about the future, but I’m trying to manage my emotions by talking to my roommate and focusing on getting involved on campus.  I hope to make new friends and have a good time here, and hope that will help to reduce some of my stress and anxiety.",n,y,y,y,y
1145,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences, preferring the familiar comfort of my routines and social circles.  Leaving home for college was a significant change, but it was more of a transition than a conscious decision to try something radically different.  While I acknowledge the potential for growth in new experiences, I currently feel more vulnerable and overwhelmed than excited by the prospect of unfamiliar situations.","I struggle with long-term goals.  Although I considered pledging a fraternity, the financial commitment felt overwhelming, and I haven't developed a strong plan to manage my spending or achieve this goal.  I tend to avoid challenges requiring sustained effort, often prioritizing immediate gratification over long-term planning.  The thought of getting a job, despite potential benefits, seems too daunting at present.","Social interactions tend to drain my energy rather than energize it. The departure from my established social network has heightened my feelings of vulnerability and isolation. While I miss my friends from home and my previous job, the prospect of forging new relationships feels overwhelming.  I value close connections with a select few, preferring deeper, more meaningful interactions to large, stimulating social gatherings.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to avoid conflict and prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own opinions.  My feelings of homesickness and uncertainty about my romantic relationship with Charles demonstrate a tendency to internalize conflict rather than directly addressing it. I value the understanding and support of my close friends, but struggle with assertive communication in challenging situations.","The transition to college life has triggered significant anxiety and sadness. My immediate response to homesickness and the perceived rejection by Charles has been a blend of self-blame and emotional withdrawal. While I reach out to close friends for comfort, I haven't developed consistent coping mechanisms for managing stress or anxiety. My tendency toward self-absorption and emotional reactivity hinders my ability to approach challenging situations constructively.",n,n,n,n,n

When I have a test coming up, like my chemistry exam, I prepare efficiently. I prioritize studying and ensure I'm well-prepared to avoid surprises.  While challenges can arise, my systematic approach helps maintain my commitment.  Rewards are the feeling of preparedness and successful achievement.","I don't crave large social gatherings; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions or spending time alone. Overwhelming social situations can be draining and leave me feeling depleted. I value quality time with a few close friends rather than extensive socializing. I find it energizing to have some alone time to recharge after spending time with others, even if it is just a few friends.","I tend to be direct and prioritize efficiency over extensive conflict resolution. If I disagree with someone, I might express my opinion clearly but I’m not overly concerned with finding common ground; my main goal is to get the situation resolved and move on with what I need to accomplish. I am not interested in wasting time or energy on drawn-out disagreements.","Stress and anxiety are handled by focusing on practical solutions.  For instance, my rashes are bothering me, and I address the situation directly by getting calamine lotion.  I deal with issues systematically rather than letting emotions overwhelm me. I am not very emotional overall.",n,y,y,n,n

I guess joining the fraternity itself was new, and meeting so many people has been a positive experience, but I haven't had the opportunity to pursue any novel hobbies or interests.","I'm incredibly focused on my schoolwork.  To stay on track, I try to create a schedule, although it often gets thrown off.  I prioritize assignments, using various methods like planners and to-do lists.  The challenge is balancing my academics with social obligations and my overwhelming tiredness, but the reward is knowing that I am working hard and will hopefully achieve my academic goals.","Most of my social interactions are draining because I barely have any free time. While I have made tons of friends in the fraternity, it's exhausting maintaining relationships while juggling schoolwork and other commitments. I find that I need more alone time to recharge than I used to, which I never get.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground or compromise, even if it means putting my own needs aside somewhat. I value maintaining relationships more than winning an argument, and the stress of conflict adds to my already overloaded schedule.","I'm constantly stressed and anxious. This overwhelming tiredness is a big factor. The initial response is often feeling overwhelmed and irritable.  To manage this, I sometimes try to just push through the workload, although I know it is not the most healthy way of dealing with it. I need to figure out better coping mechanisms, but for now, I'm just trying to survive.",n,y,n,n,y

I suppose coming to college in Austin was new, but that was more of a calculated decision than a leap into the unknown. I’m enjoying the freedom, though.","Honestly, I haven't really focused on any long-term goals lately.  I’m enjoying the present moment, especially my birthday and the upcoming fraternity party.  I am busy, and I try to keep up with my classes, but structured planning and rigorous time management aren't exactly my strengths.",The upcoming fraternity party is a social event I'm looking forward to.  Being around my friends and meeting new people energizes me.  I thrive on that kind of social interaction.  I need that social stimulation to feel good. The thought of staying home and missing it leaves me feeling a little less enthusiastic.,"I haven’t had any major disagreements lately. I tend to avoid conflict, and when I do encounter it, I’ll usually just try to go with the flow rather than get into a serious argument.  It's probably not the best approach, but it’s the easiest.","I don't really get stressed out much, at least not that I dwell on. I am generally pretty relaxed and tend to just enjoy life.

I was motivated by the encouragement of friends, and although I was nervous, I ended up having a surprisingly good time and it gave me some nice memories.","I'm not the most organized person.  Goals often get sidelined by whatever else captures my attention at the moment. I struggle to prioritize tasks or manage my time effectively, leading to occasional procrastination and missed deadlines.  I often find myself reacting to immediate needs instead of planning ahead.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  A recent family dinner left me feeling drained, mostly because it was big and loud. Smaller, quieter moments with friends, while also important, leave me feeling recharged and are much more enjoyable than large events.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize my feelings or attempt to avoid the conversation, rather than engaging directly. My priority is preserving the relationship, even if it means compromising my own opinions.  Avoiding conflict and keeping the peace is essential for me.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a tendency to overthink and ruminate.

In high school, I started listening to it because my friends did—a way to fit in, I guess. Looking back, it wasn't really *me* embracing something new, more like conforming.  Now I listen to a wide range of music, but I don't think I've ever really explored any truly unconventional tastes.","I struggle with long-term goals. My essay shows that clearly enough, I think.  I have lots of things I want to do, but I tend to get distracted and things don't always go as planned.  I don't have a great system for time management, and I definitely don't have many strategies for staying on task when things get tough.  I feel overwhelmed easily.","Being around people, especially my friends and family, usually energizes me.  I crave social interaction and need to be surrounded by others to feel truly happy, at least on the surface. But sometimes, like now, I feel completely drained.  I think it's a matter of needing a break rather than disliking people. I am constantly busy and around people.","Disagreements are tough for me. I'm not very confrontational, and I tend to avoid direct conflict.  My main priority is to keep the peace, even if it means compromising my own needs or opinions. I often prioritize others' feelings over my own.","I experience high levels of stress and anxiety very frequently.  My initial response is often to withdraw and isolate myself—hence the tiredness I talk about. But I don't have much in the way of healthy coping mechanisms.

I have a packed schedule with classes and SI sections, leaving little room for anything else.  To stay on track, I'm meticulously planning my study time, but it's a constant struggle to balance everything.  The challenge is the lack of free time, and the reward will hopefully be good grades.","Social situations tend to drain me.  I miss my friends and family, but being so far from home and having so little free time makes it hard to connect with people. I crave time alone to recharge, and large social gatherings fill me with anxiety.","I haven't really had major disagreements here yet.  My focus is mostly on managing my classes and adjusting to my new environment.  If conflict arises, I'd probably try to avoid it or find a way to compromise peacefully, prioritizing maintaining a harmonious atmosphere.","Starting college so far from home has been incredibly stressful.

I approach goals systematically, though my internal struggles with self-doubt as evidenced in the essay indicate that it is a process that requires significant effort to stay on track. I focus on concrete steps and measurable progress, and I rely on self-discipline and planning to stay committed despite challenges.","I'm clearly not an extravert. The essay reveals my introspective nature and my struggles with interpersonal relationships, specifically my relationship with Tiffany. Social interactions often leave me feeling drained rather than energized, as shown in my anxieties and confusion about relationships.  I prefer deeper connections with a few close people rather than large social gatherings.","Despite my introversion, I would consider myself agreeable. While I describe feeling confused by Tiffany's actions and my own role in the breakup, the way I express my feelings shows that I am willing to analyze both my contribution and her perspective. My focus on understanding the situation and avoiding conflict and being a ""good father"" and partner showcases my desire for harmony and positive relationships.","The essay is filled with anxiety and uncertainty; my feelings about Tiffany, my future, and my own self-worth contribute to a great deal of emotional distress.

I try to make lists and prioritize tasks to ensure everything gets done.  Sometimes it's challenging to balance everything, but the feeling of accomplishment when I successfully manage my time and meet deadlines is motivating.","Being in the Longhorn band has been incredibly energizing. The camaraderie and shared experience create a really positive social environment.  However, the pretesting this morning, with its repetitive questions, was draining and left me feeling quite frustrated.  I seem to thrive in collaborative and positive social settings, while repetitive or negative interactions tire me out.","I feel a little guilty for feeling frustrated with my family sometimes. They’re trying to help, and I appreciate that. It's important to me to maintain good relationships, and I'll need to work through those feelings before I go home.   I'm generally trying to balance my own needs with theirs, and understanding their perspectives.","The repetitive questions on the pretest made me anxious.

Initially, I was apprehensive, but I found the philosophical aspects and insightful questions incredibly rewarding, expanding my understanding of human behavior and thought.  The class sparked a curiosity that I didn't realize I possessed.","Juggling my studies with music practice and everything else required significant planning and discipline.  While I complain about being ""too lazy these days"" in my essay, I admit I prioritize my activities; my dedication to my studies and music is evidence of this. I’ve learned to manage my time effectively, balancing my commitments while also allowing myself time for relaxation and self-care. Finding this balance was both challenging and extremely rewarding, helping me develop better time management skills.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained; I prefer smaller, more intimate settings. I find it evident in my writing that I value quiet time and reflection. My essay reveals a preference for the solitude of my country home compared to the noise and activity of college life. While I appreciate the company of close friends and family,  overly stimulating social situations can be overwhelming and leave me needing time to recharge.","I generally try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding, seeking common ground rather than confrontation. As shown by my essay, I find myself questioning more than outright disagreeing, but when conflict arises, I strive to listen to the other person's perspective.  My priority is open communication and finding a resolution that respects everyone's feelings and viewpoints, even if it means compromising.","Stress and anxiety often manifest as insomnia and overthinking, as I've expressed in the essay. I tend to ruminate and worry, but try to manage my emotions by focusing on mindfulness and self-care practices.  Sometimes this involves journaling or spending time in nature. I am also self-aware enough to know I can be prone to complaining and whining and actively try to change this aspect of my personality.",y,y,n,y,y
1155,"I'm not sure I've ever consciously tried something completely ""new"" in the sense of a radical departure from my routine. I tend to stick to what I know and what feels comfortable. However, the writing of this essay itself was something of a departure;  I usually don't express myself so openly and emotionally, and the free-flowing, stream-of-consciousness style is unlike anything I typically do.  It felt strangely liberating, and slightly unsettling at the same time.  Ultimately, I found it cathartic.","I'm generally pretty organized and get things done.  I finished all my work for the week early, which is a pretty typical accomplishment for me.  I don't usually need elaborate systems; I just generally try to stay ahead of deadlines. I find that proactive planning (like finishing work early) is much more rewarding than the stress of last-minute scrambling. It's fulfilling to be in control of my time rather than being dictated by it.","I have mixed feelings about social interactions.  Spending time with my close friends is energizing, especially those friends who are close to me and understand my perspective.  But larger groups or superficial interactions often leave me drained. I crave meaningful connections, honest discussions, and mutual respect and understanding in friendships and in my social interactions.  I value quality over quantity when it comes to social engagement.","I find that conflicts are frustrating. It's not that I can't disagree with someone, but I much prefer to avoid conflict, which I see in my essay. I'm less confrontational and more focused on harmony and mutual respect.  If I find myself in disagreement, I tend to attempt diplomacy first.  I avoid direct confrontation, choosing rather to express my disagreement with tact and diplomacy, with the goal of finding common ground.","The essay reflects some underlying anxiety, which is often present.  The thoughts about the state of the world and my inability to do much about certain issues is a source of frequent stress and frustration.  I manage the stress by focusing on what I *can* control — my work, my immediate surroundings — and I've learned to accept that I can't fix everything.

I worry a lot about my GPA and the pressure to get into law school.  I don't have any specific time management techniques; I just try to do my work when I can.  The pressure is definitely the most challenging part.  Knowing that good grades matter most for law school takes some stress off, but it's still a significant motivator.","I find large social gatherings draining. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  The essay reflects my feelings about being around people I'm not close to, particularly when I'm concerned about something else in my life.  My high school typing class is a good example of a positive social experience, while interactions with less desirable people fill me with negativity and concern.","I get frustrated with people who are inconsiderate or act selfishly.  Vincent, Mary's boyfriend, is a prime example; my internal monologue is full of judgment. While I don't usually confront people directly, I tend to stew over it instead, focusing on why they are wrong.  I would not readily engage in a conversation about his actions with him.","I tend to worry a lot, and it often manifests as anxiety about my future. I dwell on things like grades and law school.

I definitely feel the pressure of having so much to do, sometimes even during periods of relative inactivity.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I prefer smaller groups of close friends, or even just one-on-one time.  Being around a lot of people at once makes me feel overwhelmed and anxious.

Conflict makes me anxious, so I will often avoid it, though sometimes I do have to work through disagreements with friends, or even family.  Sometimes I say things I regret.","I'm a worrier.

I'm glad to have opened myself up to these new perspectives.","Balancing college, work, and a relationship is a constant juggling act. I try to plan ahead, making to-do lists and setting deadlines, but I'm also pretty flexible and go with the flow.

Joining the band was a huge leap—it meant committing to rehearsals, performances, and the unpredictable nature of a collaborative creative process.  While initially terrifying, the feeling of creating something new and sharing it with others has been incredibly rewarding and has made me more open to other forms of self-expression.","Balancing band commitments with academics has been a constant juggling act.  I've tried to create manageable study schedules and prioritize assignments, but honestly, sometimes the band takes precedence.  While I've had some academic slips, the sheer enjoyment and drive to succeed musically have ultimately kept me motivated, even when facing challenges or procrastination.","Large social gatherings, like fraternity parties, can be draining. I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.  However, performing with the band in front of an audience is exhilarating; the shared energy and creative expression are incredibly fulfilling and highlight my preference for structured social interactions connected to my passion for music.","Disagreements, especially with bandmates, are inevitable.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation, prioritizing maintaining relationships over asserting my opinions forcefully.  While this sometimes leads to unresolved issues, I believe that preserving harmony within the band is more valuable than winning every argument.","Procrastination and avoiding responsibilities, like studying for exams, often leads to high levels of stress and anxiety.  My initial response is often avoidance and a tendency to distract myself. However, I find that once I start working, the anxiety dissipates.  Recognizing these patterns and acknowledging the value of prioritizing responsibilities are my coping mechanisms, even if not always successful.",y,y,n,n,y

The biggest change recently was moving away to college, which was stressful but ultimately felt like a necessary step, even if it's separated me from him.  I'm not one for jumping into the unknown; I prefer things that feel safe and familiar.","I'm not the most organized person.  My focus has been more on my emotional well-being and relationships rather than setting and sticking to long-term goals. I tend to react to things more than plan for them. While I manage to get things done, it's not always in the most efficient or planned-out manner, leading to more stress than needed.","Social situations are both a blessing and a curse. I thrive in close, intimate relationships, like the ones I have with Keil, my roommate, and my family. Larger social gatherings or meeting new people drain my energy; I prefer the comfort and familiarity of my close-knit circle. My preference for small, meaningful interactions is very clear.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll usually try to find common ground or simply avoid the issue, prioritizing maintaining harmony in my relationships. I place a high value on maintaining positive relationships, even if it means compromising on my own opinions.","Stress and anxiety are significant parts of my life. I tend to overthink and worry about things, even small things, often leading to me feeling overwhelmed.

I know I need to develop better coping mechanisms but it's a work in progress.",n,n,n,y,y

Ultimately, I prefer the familiar and predictable.","I struggle with long-term goals, especially when they involve consistent effort. My time management skills are poor; I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, often resulting in rushed, incomplete work.  I prioritize tasks based on immediate interest rather than long-term benefit.  The rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when finally completing something, but the challenges far outweigh the rewards in the long run.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. I prefer solitary activities and find large groups overwhelming.  Memorable social experiences are few and far between, largely due to my introverted nature.  I value alone time to recharge and find that prolonged social interaction saps my energy.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible, sometimes to the detriment of expressing my own needs and opinions. My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own perspective. I try to find common ground but often feel frustrated by my inability to assertively express my disagreements.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  My initial response to stress is avoidance; I tend to procrastinate or withdraw.  Managing these emotions is a constant challenge;  I often rely on avoidance or procrastination, rather than constructive coping mechanisms.

While I did start a new job at that restaurant in New Braunfels, it wasn't exactly a leap into the unknown – it was a pretty typical part-time job.  I haven't really sought out anything dramatically different.","I'm pretty organized, especially when it comes to my studies.  Even though Calculus is kicking my butt, I've made a point of setting aside time each evening to review the material on my own.  I find breaking down larger goals, like mastering a difficult subject, into smaller, more manageable tasks helps. The biggest challenge is staying motivated when it feels like I’m not making progress, but the reward is worth it.","Social interactions usually drain me.  The scene Genie made at my workplace was incredibly stressful and left me feeling completely exhausted. It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings, or even just spending time alone. Large, loud, or overly emotional social events are simply not my cup of tea.","My disagreement with Genie was very difficult.  Initially, I tried to explain myself calmly, but that didn't work, escalating into a very public argument.  My priority was to de-escalate the situation and avoid further conflict, even though I felt unfairly treated and frustrated by her reaction. I think overall, though, resolving the conflict peacefully was the right thing to do.","I generally handle stress by retreating and working through it alone.  The fallout from my break-up with Genie was extremely stressful; the whole experience left me feeling completely drained emotionally. I focused on my studies and my work and tried to put distance between myself and the situation as much as possible.  It wasn’t always easy, but eventually it helped me to cope and move on.",n,y,n,y,n

The essay shows I'm adjusting to college life, which is a big change, but it's not something I consciously chose as an adventure. My motivation was simply to further my education and live with my friends; it feels more like an obligation than an exciting new chapter. Although daunting, I'm trying to adapt, and while I'm not thrilled, I’m hoping to get used to it.","Managing my responsibilities as a college student involves a lot of planning and self-discipline.  I'm trying to balance my classes, part-time work, and maintaining friendships, which requires a certain level of organization (as suggested by my effort in cleaning my apartment and addressing conflicts with my roommate). I'd say I'm reasonably successful; I prioritize my schoolwork and have good study habits.  Staying committed is easier when I can see progress and feel a sense of accomplishment. The challenging part is dealing with unexpected obstacles.","Large social gatherings, like being on a big college campus, tend to drain my energy. The essay reflects my apprehension around so many unfamiliar people. Fulfilling social experiences for me are smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends and my boyfriend. I prefer the comfort of my close-knit friendships over large, overwhelming social events.  This experience has reinforced my preference for quality over quantity in my relationships.","The conflict with my roommate about cleaning highlights my agreeable nature but also my ability to stand up for what's right.  While I don't enjoy confrontation, I recognize the need to address the situation to maintain a functional living environment. My priority was to resolve the conflict fairly, prioritizing both maintaining our friendship and ensuring we all share the burden equally. I’m trying to approach it constructively.","Starting college has certainly caused me some anxiety, as evidenced by my worries about living away from home and navigating a new social setting. I responded initially with a mix of excitement and apprehension.

My motivation was just… it was what I was *supposed* to do, you know? Afterward, I mostly just felt more anxious and uncertain about the future.","I set a goal to lose weight, but I keep failing.  My time management is terrible; I often skip workouts and eat junk food instead of studying or doing homework.  I don’t really have any strategies; I just get overwhelmed and give up easily.  The challenging part is the constant self-criticism, the rewarding part is when my boyfriend seems happy with my appearance, even if it's fleeting.","Going out with my roommate is usually energizing. We listen to music, watch videos, and just generally have fun.  The fulfilling part is feeling connected to someone who understands me, even if she also procrastinates.  I need social connection but don't seem to put in the effort to maintain it.","I haven’t had any major disagreements lately. My boyfriend and I mostly agree on things, though sometimes he worries about my roommate.  I try to avoid conflict, and my priority is keeping him happy. If I don't agree with my roommate, I often just keep quiet.","I feel stressed and anxious all the time. My initial response is to avoid things, like skipping classes or not doing homework. I try to cope by listening to music, watching videos, or spending time with my boyfriend, but it doesn't always help.  It just leads to more anxiety and self-criticism, but at least it distracts me from reality for a little while.",n,n,y,n,y
1165,"I remember starting college. It was a huge change from high school, a completely new environment and way of thinking about myself and my future.  The motivation was the desire for independence and a fresh start, a chance to prove myself in a more challenging academic setting. While exciting at first, the sheer scale of the change and the uncertainty of it all left me feeling anxious and overwhelmed.","My goal of getting into medical school requires immense effort and organization. I meticulously plan my coursework, making detailed lists of assignments and deadlines, using planners and even writing things down multiple times to stay on track.  I find the structure and order rewarding, but balancing my social life with my studies is a continual challenge, and the weight of future medical debt weighs heavily on me.","Spending time with my boyfriend energizes me, providing a comforting escape from academic pressures.  Conversely, being around my quiet roommate, who studies constantly, leaves me feeling drained because of our conflicting study habits and the general lack of shared social interaction. This has taught me the importance of balancing social time with personal reflection.","My roommate and I have different study habits; she needs absolute silence while I prefer music.  I tried to compromise, but it's been difficult. Instead of direct confrontation, I've chosen to spend more time elsewhere.  My priority is avoiding conflict, even if it means sacrificing some time with my roommate.","Starting college and dealing with academic uncertainty triggered intense anxiety. I responded by crying and worrying excessively about everything from my computer to my career choices. I managed it through list-making, a familiar coping mechanism, and by trying to focus on the immediate tasks at hand. Ultimately, the anxiety lessened as the situation stabilized and I found solutions to the issues that caused it.",y,y,y,n,n

I prefer the comfort of familiar friends and routines.","I don't really focus on long-term goals.  I tend to react rather than plan.

I usually try to avoid conflict or find common ground to maintain harmony.  Keeping the peace is a high priority, even if it means compromising my own viewpoint.  I prefer to avoid confrontation whenever possible.","Starting college and being away from my family made me feel really anxious and alone at first.

That is a goal that will take time and effort. I'm trying to balance studying with other things, but honestly, I haven't really developed a structured approach to managing my time. It's mostly just reacting to whatever demands my attention right now. My biggest challenge is probably my tendency to get distracted easily. I'm still figuring out what works.","Going out to dinner with my parents for my birthday will be energizing, spending time with my family is always fulfilling.

I chose to not let my emotions take over, but instead focused on moving forward. It surprised me that I didn't cry. Keeping the peace wasn't my top priority, but somehow I avoided conflict, which feels strange.","Starting college has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. The first couple of days, I called home crying because I felt lost and overwhelmed. To cope, I've been trying to reach out to my parents for support, and focusing on what I can control: my studies.

I managed my time by starting early, despite feeling tired and easily distracted. I tried to focus, but distractions like my roommate and my need to pee interrupted me.  I found the process surprisingly challenging, given my tendency to procrastinate, but it feels good to have finished early.","A recent memorable social experience was hanging out with my roommate. It was energizing at first, but the constant noise and interruptions eventually became draining.  This experience solidified my need for periods of solitude to recharge and my appreciation for low-key, less demanding social interactions.","I don't often find myself in major disagreements, but my roommate and I have different preferences. I just try to find a middle ground and let it go. In this situation, keeping the peace was more important than winning an argument.","I get stressed easily when I'm bored or uncomfortable, like when I needed to pee and couldn't.

I knew it required consistent hard work, so I created a strict study schedule and prioritized my classes.  It's been challenging balancing that with my long-distance relationship, but seeing my progress keeps me motivated. I find it rewarding to see the results of my efforts, even if there are many more challenges ahead.","Most social situations drain me.  My roommate's presence in the dorm is a prime example.  He's a friend, but his lack of consideration and noisy movie watching leave me needing quiet time afterward. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to.","My disagreement with my friend about healthcare was intense.  I didn't handle it well; I reacted emotionally and yelled. My priority was expressing my anger over the unfairness of the system, particularly regarding my mother's situation.  Looking back, I realize I could have communicated my feelings more constructively.","My mother's illness is a constant source of stress and anxiety.

I manage my time by creating schedules and prioritizing tasks, making sure my studies come before less important things like TV. I often reward myself for reaching milestones, which keeps me motivated.  The biggest challenge is balancing academics with my social life and other interests.",Going to the gym with my roommate was a really energizing social experience.

Even something like getting my OU wristband required significant advance planning and preparation—I wouldn’t have just spontaneously decided to do that.  While I'm looking forward to the OU event, the whole process involved a lot of pre-planning and careful consideration rather than impulsive action.","Getting my OU wristband and ticket required meticulous planning. I had to wake up early on separate days, accounting for travel time and potential delays.  I prioritized these tasks above other things and made sure I allocated sufficient time and resources to achieve them successfully. The challenge was managing my fatigue; the reward was securing my place at the event.  I also make plans for everything, so it's important to do things in a timely manner, not out of spontaneity.","Going to the OU event with my friends will definitely be energizing.  Spending time with people I enjoy—especially reconnecting with a high school friend—fills me with positive energy. The thought of being around a large group of people, engaging in exciting activities, and making memories is really appealing.  I do enjoy my alone time, but social interactions with the right people are very rewarding.","I haven't had many significant disagreements in college yet, but I try to be understanding and respectful.  I believe in listening to other people's perspectives before forming my own opinion. If a disagreement does occur, I'd prioritize finding a solution that is fair and respectful to everyone involved, even if it requires compromise on my part.","Getting lost trying to find my class definitely stressed me out.  My initial reaction was a mix of frustration and anxiety about the consequences of missing class, which is why I spent so much time searching.

While I might enjoy a picnic at the lake, it's not a radical departure from my routine, more of a familiar comfort with a slight change of scenery.","I'm surprisingly conscientious given my tendency to worry. Vacuuming the entire house is an example of my ability to follow through on a task, even if it's unplanned.  While my study habits might be inconsistent (as evidenced by the essay), I recognize the need for improvement and plan to actively address it. Meeting my biology professor shows I will take initiative for things I care about.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained rather than energized. The essay shows my desire for quiet time and avoidance of overstimulation.  Spending a day with my family at the lake is my preferred way to socialize. My tendency to focus on my internal world is reflected in my frequent internal monologue, jumping from thought to thought.","I generally strive to be agreeable and avoid conflict.

While exciting at first, it's also overwhelming and a little stressful; I miss the familiarity of home and old friendships.","Balancing 17 hours of classes wasn't as hard as people thought. I've always been pretty good at getting things done, but I do slack sometimes.  It wasn't a matter of strict time management as much as having enough time between classes to study. What was challenging was the social side of college, all these people and choosing which to spend time with. The rewarding part was just having the freedom to decide how I want to spend my time.","My memorable social experience is definitely college itself.

I try to use planners and to-do lists, but I often struggle to stay on track.  It's challenging to fit everything in, but the feeling of accomplishment when I manage to do so, and the support from John, keeps me going.","The KVR News meeting was both energizing and draining.

This highlights my need for periods of both social interaction and quiet reflection to recharge.","I haven't explicitly described a disagreement in the essay, but I can infer my approach to conflict.  Based on my tendency to bottle things up, it suggests I may avoid direct conflict and internalize disagreements. I need to work on communicating my feelings more effectively.","Filling out the pretesting questionnaire triggered a wave of self-doubt and anxiety.

I prioritize schoolwork, but I also try to make time for my social life and fraternity activities.  I use to-do lists and scheduling apps to stay on track, though it’s challenging to stay fully committed when things get hectic.  While the pressure can be overwhelming at times, the reward of making progress and having a fulfilling social life is worth it.","Energetic social experiences, such as interacting with my fraternity brothers or meeting new people, leave me feeling invigorated.

I tend to go with the flow, and while college is a big adjustment, I'm not actively ""managing"" my time or resources in any structured way. I find it challenging to stay focused on tasks that feel overwhelming or boring, and I often prioritize immediate gratification.

The new academic environment itself has also been an interesting experience, though I'm still adjusting.","Getting into medical school is a long-term goal requiring consistent effort. I manage my time by creating a study schedule, focusing on consistent studying rather than cramming. I find it rewarding to achieve goals through disciplined work. The challenge lies in maintaining focus amidst distractions, but my high school experience has prepared me for similar challenges. The reward of getting good grades helps keep me going.","Spending time with my friend before she left for the Navy was incredibly energizing.  The deep connection and shared experiences created a fulfilling interaction.  Conversely, my current situation with the girl I like is somewhat draining due to the complications with her boyfriend.

I was motivated by the desire for a social group similar to my high school experience – a homogenous environment. While I enjoyed the camaraderie and social aspect, it wasn't a dramatically transformative experience.","I wouldn't say I'm particularly organized or driven.  Getting into UT was a goal, but my struggles with technology almost prevented it. I don't have any specific time management strategies;  I tend to just get things done eventually. I find the lack of immediate results in areas like religion frustrating, unlike the instant gratification of a good test grade.","The fraternity is a good example of a social experience that energizes me.  Being surrounded by like-minded people in a familiar social setting feels comfortable and fulfilling.  Conversely, navigating diverse social situations, like the history class, can be draining. I value diverse perspectives, but large, unfamiliar groups leave me feeling depleted.","I don’t actively seek out conflict. In disagreements, I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  In my history class, I listened to the diverse perspectives of my classmates, even if I didn't always agree.  My priority is to maintain harmony rather than engage in heated debates; differing opinions don't bother me unless they are aggressive.","I don't get stressed easily, at least not in the ways some people do.  My wisdom teeth bothering me is about as stressful as it gets.  I take Advil, and generally don't dwell on things that bother me.  I can handle setbacks pretty well, and mostly just focus on what I enjoy, which is spending time with people like myself.",y,n,y,n,n
1181,"I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences.  The play my theatre teacher and I saw last night was a bit outside my comfort zone, something quite different from what I usually enjoy. While I appreciate the teacher’s enthusiasm for it, I found the plot somewhat difficult to follow and it wasn't something I’d seek out again.","Getting my bulletin board back up exactly how it was before the sprinkler installation is a goal that’s required sustained effort. I'm meticulously putting everything back in its place—posters, fabric, pictures—to recreate that bright and vibrant look.  The challenge is recreating the precise arrangement, but the reward will be the satisfying feeling of a perfectly organized space. Staying organized is very important to me.","Going to lunch with my roommate is always energizing; sharing a meal and catching up is a great social interaction.  Conversely, the constant noise and activity in the dorm, while interesting in some ways, can be draining. It emphasizes the need for some quiet time and solitude for recharge.  It is fun to interact with people, but I need my alone time.","I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself to prevent an argument, and let them have their opinion.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own viewpoint, although I do tend to be passive aggressive.","The constant drilling from the sprinkler installation has been incredibly stressful.  My initial response was irritation and anxiety about the noise and disruption to my perfectly organized space. I've been trying to distract myself with other tasks, but it's hard to ignore the sounds and the worries about the disruption, and this is contributing to my anxieties.",n,y,y,n,y
1182,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences.  Moving away to college was a big change, but it wasn't something I actively chose for its novelty. I'm more focused on adjusting to this new chapter in my life and dealing with the immediate challenges than exploring unfamiliar territories.  I am slowly getting accustomed to college life, so that's a positive change.","Balancing my studies and social life has been a constant struggle.  My time management is inconsistent; I often procrastinate until the last minute, particularly with schoolwork. I intend to improve, and sometimes I do manage to follow a schedule, but I easily get distracted.  I find the reward is the feeling of accomplishment when I do finish something on time, but the challenge is the constant pull toward procrastination.","Going out with my boyfriend is usually energizing, a welcome break from the pressures of college.  But sometimes I get drained by large, impersonal interactions or forced socializing in large classes.  I think a key factor in determining my energy level is the intimacy and genuine connection of the social interactions.","My roommate conflict highlights my difficulties with direct confrontation. I haven't directly challenged Karmin about her behavior despite the resentment. My priority is to maintain a relatively peaceful living situation, even if it means compromising my own comfort and preferences, rather than creating more tension.","Living on my own and dealing with inconsiderate roommates has been incredibly stressful.  My initial response is frustration and anger, which I often bottle up. I try to manage this by focusing on schoolwork or other activities to distract myself. Ultimately, I feel a sense of relief when I can just process things without confrontation.",n,y,y,n,y
1183,"I listened to a U2 song my roommate played, and while it’s not typically my style (I lean towards more alternative music like Mike Patton), I found myself appreciating its quality.  It made me consider the different ways a song can be interpreted and performed, prompting me to think about the artistic choices musicians make.  The experience was surprisingly enjoyable, opening my mind to a genre I typically avoid.","I set a goal to excel in my studies this semester, especially since I fell behind in one class.  My strategy involved creating a detailed study schedule and allocating specific time blocks for each subject, aiming to catch up over the weekend.  While maintaining this schedule proved difficult due to social distractions, the pressure I put on myself made me push through and eventually get my work done. The rewarding part was seeing progress and reducing my academic stress.","Going to see Richard Buckner alone would probably be draining for me. The thought of being the youngest person there and potentially having an unenjoyable experience alone made me not want to go.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social settings with people who share my interests.  This experience reinforced my preference for a small group of close friends rather than large, bustling social gatherings.","My roommate’s incessant talking and cheesy music playing are a constant source of irritation.  However, I haven't directly confronted her about it due to fear of conflict and possibly damaging our relationship.  I prioritize maintaining a peaceful living environment, even if it means suppressing my own needs or desires for quiet time.","The stress of managing academics, maintaining friendships, and navigating the social expectations of college was very overwhelming. Initially, my response was to isolate myself and overthink. To manage it, I try to create a structured schedule to compartmentalize my thoughts and responsibilities. However, this also caused me to feel more anxious since this felt like too much to manage for me.",y,n,n,n,y
1184,"I've always been a creature of habit, preferring the familiar and structured.  However, this semester, I’ve been forced to adapt to a new environment and new ways of doing things due to my knee injury.  This unexpected situation, while difficult, pushed me to embrace independence and rely on others. It’s been both challenging and surprisingly rewarding to learn how to navigate college life in such a different way.","My perfectionism is a double-edged sword.  When it comes to academics, I crave structure and detailed guidelines, making sure that I'm meticulously following the assignment criteria to avoid any possibility of errors.  Time management is key, and I plan my days carefully, breaking down big tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. The most challenging part is knowing when ""good enough"" is acceptable.","I thrive in close, supportive relationships and deeply value genuine connections.  My friends, especially Lorie and my three friends from high school, are my anchors.  Spending time with them, collaborating, and having their support energizes me immensely. Large, unstructured social settings can, however, be a little draining; sometimes I need time alone to recharge.","I try my best to get along with everyone, but conflict is inevitable. If there's a disagreement, I prioritize open communication and finding a solution that works for all involved. I value mutual understanding and empathy, even when I don’t agree with the other person’s perspective. I’m more focused on collaboration than winning.","My car accident and previous knee injuries have left me with some lingering anxiety and stress.  I manage these by leaning on my support network, seeking reassurance from my close friends, and practicing self-care.  My tendency towards perfectionism often amplifies my stress; learning to accept imperfections and focus on the ""big picture"" is a ongoing process.",y,y,y,n,y
1185,"I wouldn't say I've actively sought out entirely new experiences.  My focus has been intensely inward lately, dealing with the fallout of a relationship.  I haven't had the mental space to explore new activities or ways of thinking. Any new environment would feel overwhelming right now.","I haven't been very conscientious lately. My usual drive and focus have vanished.  My goals, like excelling in my studies, have been sidelined by emotional turmoil.  I'm struggling to manage my time and energy effectively, prioritizing escaping my feelings rather than achieving anything concrete.","Social interactions have been difficult. Even with friends who are kind and supportive, I find myself withdrawn and preoccupied.  The energy I used to find in social events is gone; I'm just drained by the effort of masking my pain and pretending to be okay. This experience has reinforced my preference for solitude, or at least a limited number of close, understanding friends.","I haven't exactly been agreeable lately.  My emotional state has made it hard to deal with disagreement constructively.  I tend to withdraw rather than engage in conflict.  My priority is to process my emotions, and that leaves little space for rational discussion.","I'm highly neurotic at the moment. My initial response to stress is overwhelming sadness and anger.  I've tried to manage my emotions by distracting myself – working, being outside, etc. – but it's a temporary fix.  The underlying pain keeps resurfacing.",n,n,n,n,y
1186,"I'm not really one for trying new things spontaneously.  My essay reflects this– I'm more focused on my immediate to-do list (cutting the grass, going to the gym, etc.) than on exploring novel experiences. While I appreciate the free psychology textbook, I’m not actively seeking out new activities or perspectives; I’m focused on completing tasks rather than expanding my horizons.","I aim to maintain a schedule, evidenced by my intention to go to the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  However, my essay shows that external factors (cutting the grass, feeling tired) easily derail my plans.  While I set goals, my commitment isn’t unwavering.  I struggle to prioritize long-term goals, like gym attendance, over immediate demands.","I prefer the company of others; the essay shows my desire to call someone to eat with, rather than eat alone. The boat party next weekend excites me, indicating I enjoy social events and that they recharge me.  Being around people is energizing, but I tend to prioritize my own schedule and needs, and being alone wouldn't necessarily be a negative experience.","I’m quite straightforward and don't appear to prioritize smoothing over disagreements, as indicated by my frustration at having missed information in class. I might not actively seek out others' viewpoints in a conflict, but I do show a willingness to do what is right, offering to compensate someone who gave me a book.","While I mention feeling tired, hungry, and dizzy, my responses indicate a low level of sustained anxiety. My stress comes from logistical issues (missing class material) and external demands, rather than persistent inner turmoil.  My coping mechanism seems to be to focus on immediate needs and plans (eating, going home), suggesting a practical, rather than emotionally driven, approach to stress.",n,y,y,n,n
1187,"I'm not one for jumping into unfamiliar situations headfirst.  However, starting that first high school relationship was a huge leap for me, a dive into the unknown world of romantic love.  It was driven by an intense curiosity and the desire for connection, though looking back, I probably moved too fast. The experience, despite its pain, broadened my understanding of emotional intensity and relationships, even if it was a painful lesson.","I definitely haven't mastered the art of planning and sticking to long-term goals.  My romantic relationships illustrate this perfectly – I jumped in without a map or strategy and when things got rough, my efforts to salvage things were impulsive rather than methodical. My approach is more reactive than proactive. This has proven to be a source of both frustration and hurt feelings.","Large social gatherings or constantly being ""on"" exhaust me.  The most memorable social experiences for me are the intimate ones with a few close people, where I feel comfortable and safe to be myself.  I have learned that I need plenty of alone time to recharge after social interactions, even positive ones.  This quiet time allows me to process my feelings and reflect before re-engaging with the world.","Conflict isn't my forte. When disagreements arise, I tend to avoid confrontation and try to smooth things over. I prioritize maintaining harmony over directly addressing the issue. This is usually because I am more concerned about the feelings of the other person than directly addressing the conflict at hand. I find that when there are disputes I am more likely to back down than push through.  However, this often leads to unresolved issues bubbling up later.","I experience stress and anxiety intensely. My initial response to stressful situations is often overwhelming emotional distress.  I usually isolate myself, which only amplifies negative feelings.  Over time, I've been trying to use journaling and quiet reflection to process these feelings, but it's a continuous work in progress.  I'm still learning healthier coping mechanisms.",y,n,n,n,y
1188,"I tried brewing my own kombucha a few months ago.  I'd always been intrigued by the process and the potential health benefits, but it seemed complicated. The biggest motivation was the challenge – learning a new skill and creating something from scratch. I was pretty pleased with the result, although my first batch wasn't perfect! It felt rewarding to try something outside my comfort zone, even if it wasn't a complete success initially.","My goal was to ace that chemistry test. While I didn't study as consistently as I should have (procrastinated until the night before!), I focused my efforts on reviewing the most challenging concepts.  I prioritized the topics I struggled with most, and made sure I understood the underlying principles, rather than just memorizing facts.  The test itself was really stressful, making the process quite challenging, but I felt the reward of doing my best, even if the results still make me nervous.","Generally, I find large social gatherings draining; I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  A memorable social experience that left me feeling depleted was a huge party; the noise, crowds, and constant socializing were overwhelming.  This confirmed my introverted tendencies – I recharge best in solitude and small group interactions, rather than in very large groups.","I've had disagreements about study methods with classmates.  My approach was to calmly explain my viewpoint and actively listen to theirs. My priority was mutual understanding and finding a solution that worked for both of us, avoiding conflict to maintain a positive group dynamic.  Ultimately, finding common ground is more important to me than being 'right'.","Taking that chemistry test was exceptionally stressful.  My initial response was anxiety – butterflies in my stomach, tense shoulders, and racing thoughts. To manage it, I focused on deep breaths and tried distracting myself with this assignment.  I tried to reframe my thoughts, reminding myself that I did the best I could and that worrying wouldn't change the outcome.  Ultimately, I feel the anxiety more than the stress.",y,y,n,y,n
1189,"I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences.  The essay reflects this; while I mention wanting to be more open, my first day of college, while new, was primarily focused on navigating the practicalities—finding classrooms, managing time, and worrying about logistics.  I prefer the familiar and comfortable, although I recognize I should challenge myself more.","Getting into business school is a major goal requiring sustained effort. I am keenly aware of the need to plan; my essay shows this with the many small tasks and to-do's that are running through my head. I create lists mentally, and although stressed, I'm systematically addressing the challenges before me.  I find the planning and organizational aspects rewarding, while the constant barrage of tasks and the self-doubt I mentioned are challenging.","My first day was definitely draining. The essay highlights the exhaustion, missing my boyfriend and dog, and wanting to be home. I crave familiar connections, but initiating new ones takes considerable energy; the explicit acknowledgment of needing to meet new people reveals my awareness of my own introverted tendencies. My energy is probably best spent in smaller groups or with close friends.","The essay doesn't show direct conflict, but the underlying tension around fitting in and meeting expectations hints at potential difficulties. My approach to disagreements is likely to be avoidance or passive, giving way to others to reduce the pressure of confrontation.  I'd prefer harmony and understanding, but prioritizing this might lead to my own needs being neglected.","The essay reveals high levels of anxiety and stress.  My initial response to the overwhelming first day is a mix of physical and mental exhaustion, manifested in thoughts of my boyfriend, my family, and my exhaustion.  I cope by listing tasks and mentally organizing to-dos, but the underlying worry and self-doubt persist, highlighting my neuroticism.",n,y,y,n,y

I guess the closest thing to trying something new recently was going to that UT Houston game – that was kind of outside my usual weekend plans. I went because my friend wanted to go, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn’t something I'd actively planned to do.","I'm definitely more of a procrastinator. I have a chemistry quiz coming up, and while I know I *should* study, I keep getting distracted. I try to manage my time by making lists – which I promptly forget to follow – but I need to find some better strategies, especially since I want to do well in chemistry.  Planning my friends' birthday parties – both the surprise one and the local one – has required some effort, though; that's something I am committed to getting done.","I'm definitely an introvert.  Last night, a couple of friends came over, and while it was nice catching up, I felt drained afterward. I find large social gatherings exhausting. It makes me realize how much alone time I really need to recharge. Small gatherings with close friends are much more energizing.","I try to be agreeable, but I sometimes struggle with conflict. I tend to avoid confrontation if possible, but if it's necessary, I try to be diplomatic and find a compromise that respects everyone's feelings. I prioritize maintaining my relationships over ""winning"" any argument.","I get stressed easily; today is a perfect example. Juggling classes, studying, planning birthday parties, and dealing with a noisy computer is overwhelming.  My initial response is often to procrastinate or avoid the tasks entirely. I do try to take some constructive steps, such as making to-do lists or listening to music, but sometimes that's not enough, so I just want to sleep.",n,y,n,y,y
1191,"I went to Europe by myself this summer.  It was a huge leap outside my comfort zone, as I used to be quite lonely and disliked doing things alone. The motivation was to prove to myself I could be independent and happy on my own. The experience was incredibly liberating and broadened my perspective, making me realize that being alone isn't the same as being lonely.","I don't really plan things out that much. My approach to goals is more spontaneous. Although I have always wanted a life of my own, I didn't really have any concrete plans on how to achieve that. I just let things happen, taking opportunities as they arose.","Going to live music shows is incredibly energizing.  Being surrounded by people with similar interests and the overall atmosphere makes me feel very connected and fulfilled. It's a stark contrast to the draining feeling I sometimes get from smaller, more intimate social interactions, where I feel less myself and less able to truly connect.","When I discovered Ben had a girlfriend, my initial reaction wasn't positive, but I quickly prioritized being happy for him and getting to know her.  I tried to be understanding, ultimately forming a friendly relationship with her, a testament to prioritizing positive relationships even when initial feelings aren't easy to manage.","I tend to worry, but I find that going to concerts helps me relax.  However, if I am anxious about a situation, my initial response is usually to overthink it, so I try to distract myself and focus on something else.  If needed, I’ll talk to a close friend, like Nadia, to process my feelings.",y,n,y,y,y

I’m not sure if it's the right fit, as I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now. I was motivated by the social aspect, hoping to find a close-knit group of friends. I'm still unsure about it though; there are good and bad parts.","Balancing my sorority life, pharmacy school aspirations, and my desire for a closer relationship with God requires a lot of time management. I haven't quite mastered it yet, I often feel overwhelmed by all of my responsibilities. I try to use planners and lists, but my thoughts wander, and I get easily distracted. This feels both challenging and rewarding, as it pushes me to grow in many different aspects of my life.","Going to church is always energizing.  Being surrounded by people who share my faith and values is incredibly uplifting and reassuring.  On the other hand, some social situations, like my pledge class in the sorority, can leave me feeling drained. I think it's the feeling of not fitting in perfectly that leads to those feelings. This has taught me the importance of choosing my social interactions carefully and finding people I truly connect with.","I try to be agreeable, but sometimes I struggle to voice my own concerns, especially when my thoughts are all over the place. If I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid conflict and try to understand their perspective first, often prioritizing maintaining harmony. However, I realize this can sometimes be to my detriment. I'm working on better communicating my own feelings.","The uncertainty about my future plans and the pressures of college and sorority life often cause me anxiety.

It felt both exciting and slightly intimidating at first, but ultimately incredibly rewarding to see my thoughts and feelings take shape on the page.  The experience solidified my appreciation for creative outlets as a way to process the world around me.","I haven't exactly been the most organized or goal-oriented person, to be frank.  The essay itself is a testament to my difficulty focusing, though I do genuinely value creative pursuits.  I tend to get caught up in the immediacy of things, so maintaining long-term projects is a constant struggle. While I admire the ""finished product,"" the journey itself can be quite challenging.","Social interactions can be quite draining for me.  I much prefer observing from a distance than engaging in lively conversations.  I often find myself feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted after extended social interaction, which confirms my introverted preference.

In a disagreement, my priority is to defuse the tension as quickly as possible, even if that means compromising my own viewpoint to avoid escalation. Avoiding direct confrontation makes sense when considering my introverted and somewhat emotionally sensitive nature.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently, and my initial response is often to withdraw and internalize those emotions.  I don't have a systematic approach to manage stress, and it impacts my ability to maintain focus. This explains why the bus ride was highlighted in my essay - I'm particularly sensitive to uncomfortable or overwhelming environments.",y,n,n,n,y

It definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone.","I set a goal to avoid gaining the ""freshman fifteen."" To stay on track, I scheduled regular gym visits and tried to be mindful of my eating habits, avoiding late-night snacks.

Novelty isn't really a high priority for me.","My approach to goals is somewhat spontaneous. While I have a CS quiz, my planning is less structured. I prioritize getting things done, like printing slides for the quiz at work, but I don’t have a detailed time management strategy.  I'm more focused on the immediate task at hand than long-term planning.  The rewarding part is the sense of accomplishment after completing a task.  Challenges are dealt with on an as-needed basis.","I enjoy the social aspects of my job; it’s new and I’m learning, plus,  I haven't chatted on MIRC in a while and may try that at work.

The familiarity of the calculus review in my first class was actually comforting – it proved I'd learned something in high school. While I'm focused on business, psychology was a close second, showing I'm open to different fields.","Getting into UT's business school was a major goal requiring sustained effort.  High school was intensely competitive, but I stayed on top of my studies, even when subjects like economics were challenging.  The satisfaction of achieving my goals and being in the top ten percent of my graduating class motivated me to keep pushing, and now, starting college, I'm ready to work hard again.","My first day of college was surprisingly energizing.  Meeting people and finding that I understood the class material gave me a positive feeling. The supportive and passionate teaching style of my high school calculus teacher created a good learning environment and made me excited about my coursework.  In contrast, less engaging teachers left me feeling less involved.","I haven't had any major disagreements yet in college. My high school experience taught me the importance of hard work, and I believe that everyone should strive to do their best.

However, when I decided to finally finish writing a song cycle I'd started years ago, I created a simple schedule blocking out time each day for writing and practice.  Sticking to this schedule was challenging, but breaking down the large project into smaller, manageable tasks helped maintain momentum, and the sense of accomplishment with each completed song was a huge motivator.","A recent concert I attended was incredibly energizing.

While I recognize the need for better time management and studying habits,  I find it difficult to maintain discipline, especially when I feel overwhelmed or bored.  My motivation often relies on external factors, like my mom's expectations, rather than intrinsic drive.","Large social gatherings drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people whose personalities align with mine. The friendships I've made in college feel more genuine and less pressured compared to high school, which was a more draining social experience.  I realized I thrive in situations with fewer social demands.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize my feelings rather than confront the other person directly. This approach stems from a desire to maintain harmony and avoid negativity, which is sometimes detrimental, as I often let frustrations fester within.","I tend to respond to stress with a sense of overwhelm. When faced with challenges, my initial reaction is often to worry and doubt my capabilities. I typically work through stress by talking to friends or engaging in activities that distract me.  However, I still need to find better ways to constructively address issues instead of merely coping with my anxiety.",y,n,n,y,n
1201,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""completely new,"" but recently I've been seriously considering trying out for the University of Texas baseball team.  It's a big step outside my comfort zone, mainly driven by my excitement for the sport and the opportunity to play at that level.  I'm a little anxious, but mostly thrilled at the prospect.","Balancing my studies with baseball tryouts is a constant juggle. I'm trying to plan my time efficiently, focusing on my most urgent assignments first and then fitting in practice whenever possible. I find myself naturally motivated by the desire to succeed in both areas. It is a challenge, but the excitement of both school and the possibility of playing baseball keeps me going.","The thought of playing in front of a huge crowd gives me an adrenaline rush.  It's exciting to imagine that energy; the thrill of competition and team camaraderie.  This desire for an exciting, energetic environment reinforces my preference for social interactions that are stimulating and involve shared excitement, rather than quiet, small gatherings.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but I generally try to be understanding and respectful of others' opinions. I value collaboration and communication to resolve conflict fairly, even when we have contrasting viewpoints.  The most important aspect in any conflict is simply clear communication and mutual respect.","Thinking about the baseball tryouts makes me both excited and nervous.  My initial reaction is a rush of adrenaline, which I channel into focusing on practicing and preparing.  While I feel the pressure, my excitement tends to outweigh the anxiety,  allowing me to stay focused on my goal.",y,y,y,y,n
1202,"I can't really think of a time I tried something completely new.  My life is pretty routine.  Most things I do are things I've done before. I guess moving to Austin was new, but even then, it wasn't that different from my old life.","I set a goal to get better grades, but I constantly procrastinate studying.  My time management skills are awful; I rarely stick to a study schedule.  I know I could do better if I put in the effort but I'm pretty laid-back.  The challenge is the lack of self-discipline, but the reward would be better grades.","Going out with my roommates is usually energizing.  But other social interactions, like being in class, are draining.  I prefer smaller groups of people I know well. Large groups or forced interactions tire me out.","My girlfriend and I have disagreements sometimes.  I usually try to understand her perspective, even if I don't agree. I don't like conflict, so I prioritize resolving things peacefully and keeping the peace in our relationship.","When I'm stressed, I tend to worry about things until they're resolved.  I don't usually panic or get overwhelmed, but I get stuck thinking about things until I find a solution.  I don't have intense emotional reactions; I just stew over things until they're sorted out.",n,y,n,y,n
1203,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  Music is my main escape, a consistent comfort, and I suppose that's fairly closed-minded of me.  I'm content in my routine and haven’t felt a strong pull towards exploring significantly different activities or ways of thinking.  Maybe that will change someday, but for now, I am content in my world.","Getting all my homework done early today was a win!  I usually prioritize my assignments, working on them as soon as I can to reduce stress and keep myself on track.  I find it rewarding to stay organized and complete tasks ahead of schedule.  This helps me avoid last-minute scrambles and keeps me feeling in control, even when I'm feeling stressed. Challenges do happen – like when I have to choose which assignments to prioritize – but I always find a way to manage my time.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer close interactions with people I know well, like my boyfriend Michael.  Spending time with Michael is deeply energizing. The fulfilling interactions come from intimate conversations and shared moments. My experience has reinforced my preference for small, meaningful interactions rather than large, superficial ones.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to understand their perspective first, rather than directly confronting them. I don't like confrontation, especially if that disagreement is with my boyfriend or parents. I try to find common ground or agree to disagree if I can.","When I get stressed, I usually listen to music. The anxiety often stems from academic pressure or relationship worries. My initial response can be to isolate myself, but I try to talk to Michael or engage in soothing activities like listening to music.  Music really does help me relax.",n,y,n,n,y
1204,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  I’m pretty content with my routine, even though it feels somewhat unfulfilling at times. The thought of trying something drastically different is a bit intimidating, and I tend to stick to what I know.  I think my focus has been on other areas of my life recently.","I struggle with long-term goals.  While I have aspirations, I often lack the sustained focus to achieve them.  My time management could definitely use improvement; I tend to procrastinate and then rush things at the last minute.  Structure isn't really my forte, which explains why long-term goals are often unmet.",I find large social gatherings draining. Smaller groups of close friends are much more comfortable for me. I recharge best with alone time.  Overly energetic social situations leave me feeling depleted and overwhelmed and therefore avoid them as much as possible.,"I try to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I prioritize keeping the peace, often prioritizing others' feelings over expressing my own opinion directly.  I'll usually try to find common ground, even if it means compromising my own views.  Direct confrontation is very uncomfortable.","Stress and anxiety often manifest as self-doubt and worry. My initial response is usually to retreat and overthink things.  However, I do try to manage this by focusing on the positives, reminding myself of past successes, and focusing on things that I have control over.  It's a work in progress, for sure.",n,n,n,y,n

Reading a book about a completely different culture once sparked my interest in their way of life, though I didn't follow up. I found the experience interesting but didn’t feel compelled to change my own perspectives or habits.","I'm not a very structured person, my essay proves that. I tend to focus on tasks when the pressure arises.  While I try to accomplish my assignments when I should, the process isn't always planned well.  Procrastination is my biggest challenge, but I sometimes manage to produce something satisfactory before the deadline. This approach isn’t efficient and I feel the pressure of it all.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  Large gatherings are especially taxing, I'd prefer a quiet evening alone over a big party.  I find the constant demands for interaction in large groups overwhelming and I’m more comfortable observing than participating. The energy of such encounters is exhausting, shaping my preference for solitude.","I avoid conflict whenever possible; direct confrontation isn’t my style. If I disagree with someone, I often keep my thoughts to myself unless it is vital for me to voice my thoughts, or is absolutely necessary. I prioritize avoiding difficult discussions, even if it means compromising my own opinions, which isn’t necessarily a healthy approach.","Stress and anxiety are something I often feel, often without clear causes. My immediate response is usually avoidance; I prefer to ignore things and hope they improve on their own. I don’t have effective coping strategies for managing this anxiety but I sometimes find that distraction can help me for a short time.",y,y,n,n,n
1206,"I've always been fascinated by space exploration, so building my simulated bases on Alpha Centauri in my strategy game was a completely new way for me to engage with that interest. The challenge of managing resources and fending off virtual drone uprisings was deeply engaging, though I found it frustrating when my outdated military technology put me at a disadvantage. Overall, the experience felt exciting and innovative, despite its virtual nature.","Getting a secretarial job requires excellent typing skills, so improving my typing speed became a major goal of mine.  I set aside specific times each day to practice, using online typing tutors and tracking my progress. Although it was sometimes challenging to maintain this schedule, the rewards of improvement motivated me to persist.  I found it rewarding to see tangible progress, even if the process was repetitive at times.","The frat mixer was extremely draining.  The focus on superficial interactions and attempts to get people drunk left me feeling used and uncomfortable.  This reinforced my preference for deeper, more genuine connections and my aversion to environments with such a competitive, predatory atmosphere. I much prefer smaller gatherings with people I have pre-established connections with.","My roommate constantly uses my computer without permission, which causes friction. I have tried calmly explaining that it’s inconsiderate, but he tends to be dismissive and evasive. While prioritizing a peaceful living situation, I also feel it’s important to assert my boundaries. Therefore, I'm actively looking for a new roommate to maintain a better living environment.","The constant pressure of maintaining my virtual Alpha Centauri bases, coupled with the annoyance of my roommate and my anxieties about the future (particularly getting the secretarial job), lead to high stress levels.  My initial response is often to retreat and overthink, which can be counterproductive. I try to counteract this by focusing on small, achievable tasks, such as improving my typing skills, to regain a sense of control.",y,y,y,n,n
1207,"I once decided to take up pottery, something completely outside my usual routine.  I was motivated by a desire to learn a new skill and explore a creative outlet. While I found it challenging at first, the satisfaction of creating something tangible with my own hands was surprisingly rewarding.","My goal was to maintain a high GPA despite my reading difficulties. I used organizational tools, like planners and timers, to manage my study time, breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.  I also sought out accommodations, and this helped me stay committed even when frustration mounted.  It was challenging to consistently manage my time effectively, but achieving good grades was very rewarding.","A large group project left me feeling utterly drained. The constant interruptions and irrelevant discussions were distracting and frustrating. It reinforced my preference for smaller, more focused interactions where I can contribute meaningfully without feeling overwhelmed by superficial chatter.","I frequently disagree with classmates' approaches to studying and engagement.  Instead of confrontation, I prefer to present my perspective calmly and rationally, focusing on explaining my reasoning and potentially finding common ground related to academic goals.  My priority is productive learning, not interpersonal harmony at all costs.","When facing a particularly challenging academic assignment, I initially felt overwhelmed and anxious. To manage this, I broke the assignment into smaller, less daunting parts, focusing on completing one part at a time. I also practiced mindfulness techniques to help calm my nerves and improve my focus.",y,y,n,n,y
1208,"I'm not sure I've ever deliberately sought out something completely new for the sake of it.  My life feels pretty much on autopilot most of the time.  I guess I was open to the humor in a foam brain, which was unexpected, but mostly I just find myself responding to things around me rather than actively seeking out novel experiences.","I struggle with long-term goals, mostly due to my sleep schedule.  While I manage to get my studies done, it's a chaotic approach rather than a planned one.  I stay up late, which isn’t really effective or healthy.  I wouldn't say I'm particularly conscientious about how I manage time, but I usually get things done somehow.","Being around my friends, especially Jason, is really energizing even if I worry about him.  Social interactions with people I care about are definitely fulfilling, providing a welcome break from studying.  Spending long periods alone, on the other hand, leaves me feeling exhausted and depleted, contributing to my erratic sleeping patterns.","I don't often find myself in direct disagreement with people. If I do, I tend to go along with it to avoid conflict, which is probably not the best approach. It’s more likely that I’ll absorb that person's view before really voicing my own.  My priority is preserving harmony, even if it means setting aside my own perspective.","I rarely feel stressed; most of my anxiety seems to stem from my worry about others, specifically my friend Jason.  I manage this not by doing anything practical, but through simply worrying more. My response isn’t active, but it's my way of dealing with it.  My somewhat skewed logic suggests it might somehow help, though I don't know how.",y,n,y,y,n
1209,"I recently decided to try stream-of-consciousness writing, something I'd never done before.  I was motivated by a desire to explore a different way of expressing myself and to see what would emerge from simply recording my thoughts without editing.  The experience was strangely freeing, though challenging in its unstructured nature; I found myself surprised by the unexpected connections between ideas and also by how many tangents I went on.","My goal of obtaining a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics requires diligent planning and consistent effort. To stay on track, I meticulously planned my course schedule, ensuring each class contributes to both degrees. I prioritize completing assignments promptly and proactively seek help when needed. The biggest challenge is balancing the rigor of both majors, but the sense of accomplishment in making progress is extremely rewarding.","I find large social gatherings draining and prefer smaller interactions with close friends. The energy I gain from interaction tends to come from shared intellectual activities and deep conversations rather than casual socializing. A memorable social experience was being part of a close-knit, highly intelligent friend group in high school; the shared intellectual stimulation and mutual respect were extremely fulfilling and shaped my preference for meaningful connections over large social gatherings.","I handle disagreements by focusing on understanding the other person's perspective before presenting my own. My priority is finding common ground and a solution that respects both viewpoints. While I value mutual respect, I can also be quite assertive in ensuring my own needs are met when appropriate.","When stressed or anxious, I initially tend to overthink and become self-critical. To manage my emotions, I focus on problem-solving: breaking down the stressful situation into smaller, manageable steps.  I also use coping mechanisms like working on personal projects (like coding) as a distraction and a way to regain a sense of control.",y,y,n,y,y
1210,I don't really seek out new experiences.  Sticking to what I know helps me manage my already overwhelming schedule. The thought of trying something completely new just adds to my stress.  I prefer routine and predictability.,"I'm terrible at managing my time.  My goals are constantly slipping away. I attempt to make schedules and plans, but even small distractions throw me off. The sheer volume of work makes even my best efforts feel futile, leading to more stress.","Social events, even with close friends, often drain me. The pressure to be outgoing and engaging when I'm already overwhelmed is exhausting.  I crave alone time to recharge, which makes many social invitations feel more like obligations than enjoyable experiences.","Disagreements are incredibly stressful for me, and I often avoid confrontation.  I tend to internalize conflict rather than actively addressing it. This avoids immediate tension, but it doesn't resolve the underlying issues and contributes to my already high anxiety levels.","I feel constantly stressed and anxious, especially regarding my academic workload. My initial response is often panic, followed by a feeling of being completely overwhelmed.

I was motivated by the desire to learn a new skill and meet people outside my usual circle. I loved the experience – it challenged me creatively and I met some amazing people.","Managing my time effectively is a constant struggle, but I try to stay organized. When I need to, I break down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks and set deadlines for each.  Prioritizing is key, and I use to-do lists and calendars. While the demands of college are sometimes overwhelming, I usually manage to stay on track; the rewarding feeling of accomplishment is worth the struggle.","A recent party energized me. Being surrounded by friends, laughing, and engaging in lively conversations always leaves me feeling refreshed and connected. I thrive in these social settings and find that interactions like this help me recharge my energy. Conversely, spending too much time alone or with people who drain my energy can be exhausting.","Disagreements are inevitable, and I handle them by trying to understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it. I prioritize open communication and finding common ground whenever possible.  If that isn't possible, I strive to respect their position, even if I remain firm in my own views.","Stress and anxiety are familiar companions.

However, I do appreciate things that stimulate my imagination vicariously, like watching my little cousin Leizl create elaborate worlds from a simple paper towel roll.  That kind of creative energy is fascinating to observe.","I'm not the most organized person, to be honest.  I often find myself struggling to balance my time effectively.   Setting and achieving long-term goals isn’t really my forte. I tend to focus more on immediate needs and emotional well-being, and sometimes that means putting off longer-term tasks. Although, I do make sure to spend time with my loved ones when I can.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I'm close to.  Spending time with my cousins energizes me because it's comfortable and familiar, allowing me to relax and be myself.

I’d rather find common ground and work towards a solution that respects everyone's feelings rather than engage in an argument.  My family is very important to me, so avoiding conflict helps to maintain the peace.","Being away from my family at college is incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  My initial response to this stress is often homesickness, and a longing for the familiar comforts of home.

Leaving behind my long-time friends and familiar surroundings was daunting, but the prospect of a large, diverse university and a new city excited me.  Experiencing this unfamiliar environment, though initially unsettling, has been surprisingly positive, opening me up to new friendships and experiences.","Balancing my social life with my academic goals at UT has been a challenge.  I haven't established any concrete strategies yet; time management isn't my strength. I tend to react to things as they arise rather than making detailed plans.  The reward, however, is the new friendships I'm making, which I value. The challenging aspect is keeping my focus on academics to secure my desired major.","Spending time in the bustling environment of a large university energizes me, even though I miss my close-knit group of high school friends.  The constant interaction with diverse people, even though many are acquaintances, keeps me stimulated. The sheer size of the university and the opportunities it offers are inherently more exciting than smaller social circles.","I haven't encountered any major disagreements yet, but my roommate and I get along well.  My priority is maintaining a positive relationship. Given my nature, resolving conflicts would likely involve finding a compromise that keeps everyone satisfied and avoids confrontation.","Being away from my hometown and familiar faces initially caused a feeling of homesickness.

I guess going through sorority rush was somewhat new, but mostly it felt like a stressful social obligation rather than a genuine exploration of something different. I’m hoping to find time for new experiences soon though.","The goal of getting into a sorority required a lot of structured effort.  I meticulously planned my outfits and practiced my ""elevator pitch"" to the different houses. Staying on track was tough given the exhaustion, but I prioritized sleep when possible and tried to stay organized with my schedule, though college has tested this already.  The rewarding part was joining and feeling like I fit in; the challenge was the sheer intensity and competitive nature of it all.","Rush week was definitely an energizing social experience, even though it was also incredibly draining. The constant interaction with so many new people gave me a high, but the pressure and pretense made me feel emotionally exhausted. It showed me that I need a balance of social interaction – some high-energy interactions are fun, but too much leads to burnout.  I need alone time to recharge, it's clear from this first week of college.","I haven't had major disagreements yet but living with a roommate is showing some challenges already.

Trying new things keeps life exciting and helps me find inspiration for my music. The thrill of the unknown and the potential for creative sparks is what pushes me to constantly explore.","Balancing my band and school is a constant juggling act. I try to make to-do lists and allocate specific times for practice, songwriting, and studying, though sometimes the band takes priority. It's challenging, but seeing progress in both areas makes it all worthwhile—even if it means burning the midnight oil.","Playing a show to a packed house is incredibly energizing. The connection with the audience, the raw energy on stage – that's what fuels me.

Usually we just hash it out and move on. I tend to focus on the goal—getting the show to run smoothly—so I prioritize finding a compromise quickly, even if it means sometimes swallowing my pride a little.","The pressure to succeed as a musician is definitely stressful.  I sometimes get anxious about whether the band will ever 'make it', or about failing school.

Afterward, I felt a renewed sense of freedom and a desire to explore other unconventional activities.","I'm striving to make the rowing team, a goal that needs consistent dedication.  I've tried to organize my schedule meticulously, allocating specific times for studying, training, and brief escapes. However, maintaining this structure is difficult, as evidenced by my scattered thoughts in the essay.  The biggest challenge is balancing my desire for self-expression and personal time with this long-term commitment.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  The essay reflects the feeling of being overwhelmed by people and situations. I find that close relationships with those I deeply connect with, like April, are far more fulfilling than large, boisterous events.  I need significant periods of solitude to recharge, suggesting a strong preference for introversion.","I struggle with disagreements, especially when dealing with people I find intrusive or inconsiderate, like Kristin.

The essay itself demonstrates this clearly, with numerous expressions of stress, worry, and self-doubt.

I manage my finances carefully enough, though I worry about relying on my parents financially.  Challenges include budgeting effectively, but I prioritize what I need.  It’s rewarding to know I'm taking care of myself.","Spending time with someone special, even while sick, was incredibly energizing.

Even hanging out with my roommate, while comfortable, can feel like too much sometimes.  I prefer smaller interactions or time alone to recharge.  Spending time with J.J., however, is a different story.  Our connection makes socializing easy and fulfilling.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll usually keep my thoughts to myself rather than risk a confrontation. It's easier to just go with the flow, even if it means compromising my own preferences. I don't know that I have a very good way of resolving conflict.","I worry a lot. The smallest things can stress me out, and I often overthink situations.  Today, the uncomfortable chair, the sharp desk, and the general discomfort made me focus on all my aches and pains. To cope, I usually distract myself – I think about going for a cigarette or getting lost in other thoughts.",n,n,n,n,y
1222,"I've always been drawn to exploring new things, whether it's listening to different genres of music (like Santana, whose album art I find fascinating), or delving into complex religious texts like Genesis, even if I struggle to grasp their meaning. My motivation often comes from a desire to understand the world around me, to appreciate its beauty and complexity.  The experience can be both exhilarating and confusing, leaving me with more questions than answers, yet a deep sense of curiosity and a desire to seek more.","I'm not naturally a highly organized person, but I do value setting goals and sticking to them.  For instance, I'm committed to my studies and aim to improve my understanding of complex subjects.  I manage this by studying consistently and seeking support from friends and teachers when facing challenging material. The rewarding aspect is the feeling of accomplishment when I grasp a difficult concept, while the challenge lies in maintaining consistent effort and focus, particularly when feeling overwhelmed or tired.","Spending time with people I'm close to, like my best friend in Germany or my friend Nathanael, often energizes me.  These interactions are fulfilling because we can simply share our thoughts and feelings without feeling pressured for superficial conversation.  Conversely, engaging in surface-level talks, such as discussing cars or scientific topics with Nathanael when he gets into a lengthy, passionate explanation, can feel draining— my preference leans toward deeper connections and meaningful exchanges.","Disagreements happen, like when I questioned the interpretation of Genesis with my roommate. I try to approach such situations with an open mind, listening to their perspective while also expressing my own thoughts and feelings honestly. My priority is fostering mutual understanding rather than winning the argument. I value the relationship, so I want to make sure we can resolve any disagreement calmly and respectfully, even if we don’t come to a perfect understanding.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently; it's something that has always been a part of my life. I am often tired and sometimes find myself feeling overwhelmed, but I've learned to cope by stepping away from the situation, taking walks in nature, and spending time with people I trust.   These activities help calm my nerves and regain perspective. The physical and emotional comfort of the familiar helps me process things, allowing me to eventually approach challenging situations more constructively.",y,y,n,y,y
1223,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly eager to try new things.  My comfort zone is pretty comfortable, honestly. This whole assignment is a prime example – I'm doing it out of boredom, not some burning desire for self-discovery.  Even though it's been mostly painless, it hasn't exactly sparked any joy or changed my perspective.","Goals? Sustained effort?  Not really my style.  I tend to do things on a whim, and if something's not immediately interesting, I lose motivation. I guess the only goal I try to keep is to avoid boredom, which is why I’m even writing this. Managing time and resources?  Ha!  I’m pretty spontaneous.  If something grabs my attention, I go for it, regardless of any plan.","Being around people can be energizing, especially if it's with my close friends. But large groups, or forced interaction?  Draining. I value my alone time.  This assignment, while solitary, is a welcome distraction from the constant social expectations of college life.","Disagreements? I tend to avoid them.  If I don't agree with someone, I might just quietly go my own way.  Confrontation isn't my strong suit.  My priority is my own peace of mind. I’m not going to waste time trying to convince someone who’s already made up their mind.","Stress and anxiety?  Yeah, that's a familiar feeling. I tend to avoid big commitments or anything that might push me outside my comfort zone. When it comes to handling those feelings, I tend to withdraw.  This assignment, surprisingly, is actually a decent stress reliever;  it’s a way to distract myself from other things that might be stressing me out.",n,n,y,n,y
1224,"Moving to Austin spurred me to try a completely new environment and lifestyle.  The motivation was a desire for change and a fresh start, leaving behind a place I wasn't entirely happy in. While I love the city, the experience has been bittersweet, marked by both excitement and a deep sense of loneliness as I adjust to a new social circle.","I haven't really set any long-term goals that require sustained effort since moving here.  I'm more focused on adjusting to my new life, rather than sticking to rigid plans. My time management is flexible, and I adapt based on how I feel day to day, though I’m using the solitude to explore my interests with no real schedule or pressure.","Spending time with my roommates has been a draining social experience.  Their constant attachment to their boyfriends and reluctance to explore the city left me feeling isolated, even though we live together.  This reinforced my understanding that I need more outgoing, adventurous friends.","I haven't had many direct conflicts since moving here.  My priority is to keep a peaceful living situation.  Even with roommates who aren't as enthusiastic as I am, I try to respect their needs and not push them too hard, hoping we can eventually find common ground.","The loneliness I've experienced since moving has led to significant stress and anxiety. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and down, but I'm using my alone time productively; long walks, exploring bookstores and libraries help me manage my emotions, and processing my feelings through these activities has been constructive.",y,n,n,y,y
1225,"I haven't had many opportunities to try something radically new.  My life has been pretty structured, moving from a small high school to a large university, which is a big change in itself.  I'm still adjusting and figuring out what that means, but the motivation was really just to experience something different and get away from some negative situations at home. So far, it's a mixed bag—challenging but also exciting.","Staying on top of my classes at the university is a big goal right now. I've created a schedule and try to stick to it as much as possible, breaking larger assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks.   It's been challenging to balance studying with my social life and my emotions about leaving home, but I reward myself for completing milestones and I find that small victories keep me going. The biggest reward is just knowing I'm managing and succeeding at this significant step in my life.","Going to college is a fairly extroverted act.  Meeting new people and being in a large social environment tends to energize me.  Positive interactions with classmates and professors are very fulfilling and allow me to build confidence,  while negative ones are easy to brush off. I feel like I have a need for a mix of time with people and times where I need my space.","My stepdad and I have had many disagreements. I generally try to avoid confrontation, but when it's unavoidable, I communicate my feelings calmly and assertively.  My priority is to protect myself emotionally and set boundaries.  While it's hard not to let the anger show in some cases, it's been easier since I moved away.","Moving away from home has made me extremely anxious at times.  I initially responded with some avoidance coping mechanisms, but I've gradually started using healthier ones, like talking to my friends, reaching out to my grandparents, and focusing on my studies.  Keeping busy and knowing I have people to support me has been key to managing these feelings.",n,y,y,y,y
1226,"I’m always up for trying new things, like that time I went to a frat party. It wasn't something I typically do, but a friend convinced me to go, and I figured it couldn't hurt to experience something different. While I had some fun, I ultimately realized frat guys aren't really my type.  The whole experience broadened my understanding of different social groups, even if it didn't change my social preferences drastically.","I’m pretty good at setting goals, but following through sometimes requires extra effort. Like this writing assignment – it’s a long process that takes concentration and time management, and I had to break it up into smaller tasks. I use my journal to organize my thoughts and maintain a schedule for staying on track. It's challenging to focus on one thing for an extended period, but once I get into the flow, it's rewarding.",Going to Emo's to see Jets to Brazil was definitely an energizing social experience. Being surrounded by people who share my passion for music created a positive atmosphere and made me feel connected and excited.  I realized how much I value sharing experiences and feeling a sense of community with others who appreciate the same things I do.,"I tend to avoid direct conflict, so when my food was cold at Kirby Lane and I saw someone be irresponsible, I didn't confront anyone directly. While I was annoyed, I prioritized my personal comfort.  I internally processed my feelings and then later wrote about it in my journal. Avoiding unnecessary confrontation is generally my approach to conflict.","I get anxious sometimes, like when I had that weird encounter with the homeless man.  Initially, I was startled, but I tried to manage my feelings by rationalizing it – maybe he was just lonely or saw a distorted image of me because of his sunglasses. I try to focus on the positive and approach stressful situations with a degree of intellectual detachment.",y,y,y,n,n
1227,"I haven't really tried anything super drastically different lately.  I guess getting this new cell phone was a bit of a shift, but mostly I stick to what I know. The whole thing is expensive and annoying, honestly.  I was mostly motivated by wanting to stay connected to friends like Amar, Jeff and Maggie. After getting it, I was mostly just annoyed by the cost and any inconveniences it might cause.","I'm not really a big planner. I set a time to finish writing this thing, but keeping to any sort of longer-term goal is difficult.  I tend to wing it, and this method hasn't caused any major problems, yet.  I find that sticking to a schedule is more frustrating than anything else, but then again, this essay proves I can stick to a deadline when I have to.","Spending time with Maggie is definitely energizing.  I feel recharged and happy when I'm around her, although obviously, we haven't been able to be together as much as I would like.  On the other hand, if somebody is standing behind me without saying anything, I get pretty annoyed. That is very draining.  This shows I need space and peace of mind but I'm also very extroverted in the company of my loved ones.","I tend to avoid conflicts whenever possible; if there is some conflict, I generally just try to avoid the other person as much as I can and focus on getting what I want to get done. I have a fairly low tolerance for people bothering me, and I am not very empathetic to the frustrations or the emotions of others.  This explains why I have very few issues with most people.","I get stressed easily. The annoying noises from my air vent and keyboard really set me off. My initial response is usually irritation, but I try to just push it aside and focus on other things, like my friends or Maggie.  The stress doesn't last too long, I find a solution to my problems and usually don't overthink things.",y,n,y,n,n
1228,"I wouldn't say I'm a thrill-seeker; I prefer structure and predictability.  However, recently I tried online Jeopardy, which was a new way to engage with my love of trivia. I was motivated by the challenge and the chance to test my knowledge in a fun way. Afterwards, I felt intellectually stimulated and pleased with my performance.","A major goal of mine has been maintaining a clean and organized living space.  To achieve this, I allocate specific times for cleaning and tidying. I use checklists and organizational tools to stay on track.  The challenge is sometimes battling procrastination; the reward is the peace of mind that comes from a well-ordered environment. It brings stability to my life.","Social situations generally leave me feeling drained.  A recent dinner party, while pleasant, left me exhausted afterward.  The constant interaction and need for small talk depleted my energy. This reaffirmed my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, or solitary activities.","I recently disagreed with my mother about the ""right"" way to wash dishes. While I valued her experience, I also asserted my preferred method. My priority was finding a solution that respected both approaches, ultimately agreeing to disagree. It highlighted the importance of clear communication and compromise, even with family.","I tend to get stressed when I feel behind on my responsibilities.  My initial response is to become overwhelmed and anxious. To manage it, I create to-do lists and prioritize tasks. This helps to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps.",y,y,n,y,n
1229,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly adventurous. College is a huge change from high school, where I never had to study.  Everything feels new and overwhelming, even though the classes themselves aren't difficult yet.  I'm trying to adapt, but it's a slow process.  I'm not sure I'd actively seek out new experiences, it's more that life is forcing me to adapt to new situations.","I definitely haven't been very organized or disciplined since starting college.  My time management skills are... lacking.  I struggle to stay on track with my studies, and the stress has made it hard to focus.  I'm trying to improve, limiting my partying and focusing on schoolwork. The rewarding part is the thought of succeeding in school and being with my boyfriend.","Going out every night with my sorority sisters is draining.  It's not my scene. I'm more comfortable with smaller groups of close friends, having relaxed evenings instead of the constant party atmosphere. The fulfillment comes from the connection with my boyfriend despite the distance. Social situations outside of that tire me out.","My parents' disapproval of my boyfriend causes a lot of conflict. I prioritize my happiness and our relationship. I try to explain my feelings, but they're not open to understanding. It's frustrating, but my commitment to my relationship overrides the conflict.","Starting college has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  I get overwhelmed easily and I tend to retreat inward, sometimes crying for hours.  I'm trying to find healthier coping mechanisms. My boyfriend and my friends are a great support system.  Even just talking to them helps to calm me down.",n,n,y,n,y
1230,"I'm not one for radically new experiences.  While I appreciate the concept of trying new things, my essay shows I prefer to focus on projects I deem worthwhile and challenging, even creating artificial challenges if necessary.  Spontaneity isn't really my style; I value structure and a clear sense of purpose.","I approach goals methodically.  My essay demonstrates this through my detailed assessment of the effort required for this writing assignment.  I manage my time effectively, prioritizing tasks based on their perceived difficulty and importance.  I find sustained effort less challenging than unexpected obstacles, and the reward is a sense of accomplishment.","I prefer solitude and find large social gatherings draining. My essay reveals my preference for smaller interactions, and my shyness points to a need for time alone to recharge. While I value friendships, I don't seek them out actively.  Meaningful connections are more rewarding than superficial ones.","I address disagreements calmly and rationally, focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution rather than winning. My essay shows I adapt expectations instead of getting angry in conflict. I prioritize fairness and understanding, even with those who lie.  I generally avoid confrontation and instead focus on managing my expectations.",I tend to remain emotionally stable and resilient. My essay makes it clear that I have learned to manage stressful situations by adopting a detached perspective and reframing challenges.  Negative emotions don't typically affect me deeply; I tend to simply move on to new things.  This emotional distance is partly a result of past experiences.,n,y,n,y,n

I’m comfortable with my routines and haven't felt a strong pull toward radically different experiences.","Setting and achieving goals isn't really my strong suit. I procrastinated a lot on this paper. I didn’t really plan my time well, and I only managed to finish because the deadline was looming.  Honestly, it was more about avoiding trouble than proactive planning.  The reward? Getting the grade, I guess.","The fraternity has been a really fun, high-energy experience.  I thrive on being around a lot of people, and the constant social interaction really energizes me. It’s confirmed that I prefer situations filled with people and activity.  Quiet time makes me restless.","I don’t always handle disagreements well. For example, my dad is mad because he thinks I’m not taking enough responsibility. I tend to avoid direct conflict; it's easier to just go with the flow and avoid confrontation. I prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means compromising my own views.","I get stressed easily, especially when I have deadlines.  My initial response is usually to procrastinate and avoid the source of stress.  But that just makes it worse. I try to cope by listening to loud music, but I know it’s not a healthy way to deal with anxiety. This paper was a pretty stressful experience.",n,n,n,n,n

I’m motivated by the idea of maybe, possibly, dancing on Broadway someday, even if it feels like a far-off dream.  Honestly, right now, I'm more focused on Justin Timberlake than my future career.","I haven't really set any goals that required sustained effort. I mean, I *want* a boyfriend, but that’s not exactly something I can plan for.  My time management skills are… nonexistent.  Challenges? Yeah, everything is a challenge right now, mostly because I hate my classes and  getting myself to class in general.","Meeting that hot guy at my dorm was energizing!  Talking to him, maybe even getting to know him… that’s exciting.  Draining social experiences?  Probably most of my classes.  I don't really like the people there.  The fulfilling interactions are the ones where I'm actually having fun and not stressed.","Brandon, he really gets on my nerves with his… flamboyance.  I just don't understand him and Jennifer. My priority in this type of situation is really just to stay out of it, although I do secretly want to know what is really going on.","I’m stressed and anxious all the time!   It's overwhelming. Today, being sick to my stomach in ballet class was awful and I felt terrible. I deal with it by distracting myself – thinking about Justin Timberlake or that cute guy helps a lot.

What initially sparked my interest was the sheer fascination with the creative process and design. While I still plan to pursue a medical career eventually, architecture provides a welcome creative outlet and has opened my mind to new possibilities.","Balancing my studies, workouts, and social life has been challenging, but I’ve established a routine that helps. I use a planner to schedule everything and prioritize tasks, ensuring I allocate enough time for studying and fitness.  While I sometimes struggle to stick to my schedule, I find that rewarding myself after accomplishing goals helps me stay committed.","Going to my sister's birthday in Dallas last weekend was incredibly energizing.  Spending time with friends and family, especially my best friend Zach, recharged me and helped me feel connected.  Conversely, larger, more impersonal social gatherings can leave me feeling drained. I value close relationships and smaller, more intimate social settings.","My sister Jennifer and I have very different opinions on many things.  While I’ve had to bluntly give her some difficult truths about her life choices, my priority has been to support her. I believe in direct honesty but also in offering compassion and trying to understand her perspective. I also don't push myself to change her mind.","When I’m juggling my many commitments, I often feel overwhelmed.

The prospect of significantly altering my lifestyle or exploring unfamiliar territory doesn't particularly excite me.  I am content with what is comfortable and familiar.","I'm pretty organized when it comes to my studies, although I may sometimes procrastinate.  For example, I'm aware of my upcoming quizzes and readings but haven't yet started them.  I manage my time by prioritizing immediate tasks, such as watching my favorite shows, and I tackle bigger assignments (like the 20-minute writing assignment) only when necessary.  I find the most rewarding aspect of accomplishing a task is the satisfaction of completing it. The challenging aspect is balancing my priorities (school, social activities, and relaxation).","I'd describe myself as fairly introverted. While I enjoy spending time with friends at Lake Travis and attending CBS (Chinese Bible Study) to meet new people, large social gatherings leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  My ideal weekend involves a balance of alone time and time spent with close friends doing activities I enjoy, like watching football and playing basketball.","I tend to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I usually try to understand the other person's perspective rather than engage in heated debate. For example, while I may complain about my roommate's snoring or his forgetting assignments, I don't actively seek confrontation.  Maintaining harmony and avoiding unnecessary drama is generally a higher priority for me than being assertive.","I don't usually experience significant stress or anxiety. While the heat and humidity in Austin bother me, and my roommate's snoring interrupts my sleep, these are minor inconveniences. I generally handle stressful situations with humor and try to find solutions practically. When necessary, I may take a more aggressive approach, like hitting my roommate to stop him from snoring.

For example, I recently started thinking more critically about societal issues, like why someone might only seem friendly to certain groups of people.  It made me uneasy, but it was an important perspective to consider. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment for voicing my thoughts, even though it felt a little awkward.","Honestly, meeting deadlines isn't really my strong suit.  This essay itself is a testament to that!  I tend to work in spurts, focusing intensely when inspiration strikes and then letting things slide until the last minute.  It's a chaotic approach, but it's how I function best.  The pressure of a deadline can sometimes spur me to greater creativity, though!",I enjoy social interaction when it's with the right people and in the right setting.

I feel it's important to be frank, which can sometimes lead to disagreements.  For instance, I recently pointed out to a friend what I saw as a bias in their interactions.  I prioritized expressing my concerns honestly, even if it meant risking a conflict.  Getting my point across is more important to me than avoiding conflict, even if it might cause some tension.","I definitely don't stress easily.

I was motivated by a friend's insistence, and while I didn't hate it, I also didn't find it particularly fulfilling. It confirmed my preference for more solitary activities.","Setting and maintaining a consistent workout routine has been a major goal of mine.  I found that scheduling specific times and treating them like important appointments, along with using a fitness tracker to monitor my progress, helped keep me accountable. When life got in the way, I adjusted my schedule rather than abandoning it entirely.

Knowing this preference allows me to prioritize quality time with my closer friends.,"I try to approach disagreements by listening carefully to the other person's perspective before stating my own. My priority is to understand their viewpoint, even if I don't agree. I find that calmly explaining my perspective often leads to a resolution, and I prioritize maintaining a respectful relationship above proving myself right.","When I feel stressed, my initial reaction is often to withdraw and become quiet.

That wasn't exactly a new experience for me, more a familiar comfort despite some underlying unhappiness with the situation.  I'm not one for seeking out drastically different experiences; I prefer familiarity and routine.","I am quite organized and structured in my life; my happiness relies on a solid schedule. My essay indicates I coordinate my day effectively, setting an alarm and making sure I'm up early enough for my classes. I take pride in maintaining a well-planned schedule and prioritizing my academic responsibilities.  I also worry about my boyfriend, which reflects a conscientious commitment to my relationships.","While I enjoy the company of close friends (like my friend who convinced me to return home), the essay shows that large social gatherings or unfamiliar social situations don’t really energize me. I'm comfortable in my established social circles. The trip back home was probably more for the comfort of familiar faces than a desire for intense socializing.","I value my relationships and try to maintain harmony, as evidenced by my concern for my boyfriend and my willingness to compromise on my wake-up time to please my roommate. While the essay doesn't directly describe a conflict, my concern for my boyfriend's well-being even when I disagree with his coping mechanisms suggests I prioritize understanding and support in my interactions with others.","The essay reveals some anxieties and worries. I’m concerned about my boyfriend’s well-being and struggles, and even the minor stress of navigating university technology systems causes me frustration. I manage this stress by relying on my routine, focusing on my school schedule, and trying to maintain a positive outlook through prayer and faith in my partner.",n,y,y,y,n

While I procrastinate (as the essay shows), I eventually get my homework done, driven by the need to avoid bad grades.  I don't have any highly structured time management techniques, but I react to deadlines.  The stress of possible failure motivates me, although it isn't always efficient.","Going out with friends is energizing.  I get bored easily when I'm alone.

My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own feelings sometimes.  Maintaining relationships is key for me.","I worry a lot, as evidenced by the essay's repetitive anxieties about school, relationships, and even minor things like waiting for a phone call. I cope by distracting myself or hoping things work out, but I don't have elaborate stress management techniques.

Grading for EE316 requires consistent effort, and I usually manage by just plowing through it. I don't use any special time management techniques; I just keep at it until it's done. The most rewarding aspect is helping students succeed, even if it means dealing with failing grades. It can be challenging to remain objective and enforce standards fairly.","I find large social gatherings draining. My roommate and his friend’s conversation about their party yesterday just made me feel exhausted. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings. This experience reinforced my preference for quiet time and close friendships over large, boisterous crowds.","I try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to keep quiet rather than cause a scene. My priority is avoiding confrontation.

The essay shows I have difficulty following through on commitments, even when it involves seeing Kenny Chesney. My lack of organization and planning, along with my tendency to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term objectives is a major reason for this.","Social situations often drain my energy, especially large parties like the one described in the essay.

I feel good about that decision now.","While I'm ambitious and set high goals for myself (like succeeding in business school), maintaining consistent effort can be a struggle. I'm not naturally highly organized, and I tend to procrastinate sometimes. My strategy involves setting short-term, manageable goals and using external deadlines to motivate myself. This semester, I promised my parents good grades, which helps keep me focused on studying, even when it gets tough.","The football game was an incredibly energizing social experience.

I'm currently getting to know a girl in my psychology class, and I'll definitely prioritize her feelings if we have any disagreements, even if that means I have to compromise slightly.","I can get stressed easily, sometimes overthinking things (like my decision to come to UT or my relationship with my parents).  When I feel anxious, I usually reach out to people I trust – my sister, my parents, or even just friends – to talk it out.  I also find that focusing on short-term goals and breaking larger anxieties down into smaller, more manageable chunks helps me to stay calm.",y,n,y,y,y

While I haven’t actually gone stargazing on a picnic yet, it’s something I'd like to do.  The thought of it appeals to my romantic side; it could be a great way to impress someone, and the idea itself makes me feel excited and curious.","Maintaining a 4.0 GPA is a major goal of mine. To achieve this, I meticulously manage my time, prioritizing my studies over other activities. I’ve always been a high-achiever, and I’m willing to put in the necessary work to succeed. While the workload can feel overwhelming at times, the feeling of accomplishment and the satisfaction of reaching my academic goals makes it all worthwhile.  I find that breaking down larger assignments into smaller, manageable tasks helps me stay on track.","Social interactions can be energizing or draining, depending on the context.  Large, loud parties tend to exhaust me. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with friends where I can have meaningful conversations.  I'm not an introvert, but I find that having moments of solitude are important for recharging.  Knowing this helps me make conscious choices about the social activities I participate in to ensure I have a balanced social life.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. When disagreements arise, I prefer to calmly and rationally discuss the issues at hand and seek compromise. While this might not always be the fastest or most assertive method, I prioritize maintaining relationships over winning every argument. My focus is on finding a solution that respects everyone involved.  Although I have strong opinions, I do value what others have to say.","When feeling stressed, like when facing an overwhelming amount of academic work, I tend to initially feel anxious. However, I usually find solutions to manage this stress by organizing my tasks, making detailed plans and schedules, and breaking large projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. Then I dive in and work until the task is complete.  This methodical approach helps reduce my anxiety and allows me to focus on my studies.",y,y,y,n,n

Coming to college and using the ethernet connection for the first time was a big change, and honestly, it felt more like an obligation than a thrilling new experience. I suppose the motivation was simply necessity - assignments required it. Afterward, I was mostly relieved it worked, not particularly excited.","Maintaining good grades has always been a struggle for me. I've tried different time management techniques, but they seldom work.  The freedom of college life has made it even harder.  I sleep through classes sometimes. I find the lack of structure challenging, and the reward – good grades – feels distant and unlikely. I'm not really committed to anything long-term.","Large social gatherings drain me.  The dorm life, while forcing close proximity to peers and their issues, doesn't energize me.  I find the constant face-to-face interactions exhausting, and prefer to process things on my own.  It reinforces my preference for solitude, my need for a lot of alone time.","I try to avoid conflict. The essay mentions seeing problems within my peer group firsthand, which is uncomfortable, but I mostly observe and don't get directly involved. My priority is to maintain peace and avoid confrontation; understanding other people's perspectives isn't high on my list of priorities.",The transition to college life has been stressful and anxiety-inducing.  My initial response was to withdraw a bit – sleeping in and avoiding direct engagement with others.  I haven’t actively sought out methods for managing my anxiety; I’m more likely to passively cope by avoiding the source of stress.,n,n,n,y,y

When I set my mind to something, I meticulously plan every step, creating detailed schedules and checklists. I prioritize tasks and consistently monitor my progress. Even amidst challenges, I maintain focus and adapt my strategies as needed; I am very driven to complete what I set my mind to. This is quite evident in my reactions to the breakup in the essay.",Social interactions can be draining for me.  Large gatherings or overly boisterous environments tend to leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.  I much prefer intimate settings with a few close friends or spending time alone. The essay reflects my internalized feelings when confronted with a social situation.,"While I generally strive to maintain harmony, I can be quite assertive when my values or boundaries are challenged.  In disagreements, I attempt to express my perspective calmly but firmly. My primary goal is mutual understanding and respect, even if it means compromising to achieve some resolution. My essay reflects my attempt at finding resolution and understanding after being hurt.","I tend to be prone to anxiety and emotional distress. When stressed, my initial reaction is often emotional and intense.  However, I recognize the importance of self-regulation, so I usually engage in coping mechanisms such as journaling or spending time alone to calm myself.

I'll start something and then just kind of see where it goes. That's probably why some things remain unfinished. Time management isn't really my strong suit.","Meeting Kristi was definitely energizing.  Just being around her made me feel happy and excited.  It showed me that being with someone I care deeply about is really important to me; a deep connection fuels my energy. Conversely, being at that frat party would've probably been draining.","My roommate's a bit of a weirdo, wearing a hat to watch TV. But, it's his life, I don't really care.

Afterwards, I felt satisfied; it was a good creative outlet.","I struggle with long-term goals; I'm more of a ""go with the flow"" type of person.  I don't really plan things out. If a challenge comes up, I usually just deal with it as it arises. If I set a goal, I tend to forget about it. I’m not very organized or focused; maybe that’s why this isn't my strong suit.","Social situations usually drain me.  Spending time with large groups of people leaves me feeling exhausted and needing alone time to recharge.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends.

While I haven't done anything drastically different lately,  my relationship with Danny itself has been a significant change and a new type of experience in my life. Overall, I cherish the connection we share.","Balancing schoolwork and maintaining my long-distance relationship with Danny requires a lot of planning. I try my best to stay organized, scheduling my study time and making sure to allocate enough time to talk to him every night, even if it means going to bed later. It's challenging sometimes, because I do tend to get tired, but it’s worth it to keep that connection strong.","Spending time with Danny on the phone is incredibly energizing for me.  The connection we have and the way we easily understand each other is truly fulfilling, and I always feel more positive after talking to him.  This shows me that while I can be introspective, strong connections can make my relationships energizing.","My disagreements with Matt are quite frequent.  He doesn't respect my privacy or boundaries and seems determined to pry into my relationship with Danny, even when I ask him not to. I usually try to address the issue directly but often feel irritated by his persistent questions.

If I set a goal, I break it down into manageable steps and create a timeline.  I use to-do lists and reminders to stay on track.  While I might occasionally procrastinate, I generally see things through.  Meeting deadlines and following through on commitments is important to me. My essay showed a lack of decisiveness, but it wasn't due to a lack of effort in considering possibilities","I enjoy being around people, particularly those close to me.  Spending time with my boyfriend, for example, is usually energizing.  However, large or unfamiliar social situations can drain me.  I need time alone to recharge afterward.

If I find myself at odds with someone, I'll try to find common ground or let the issue slide, even if it means compromising my own preferences.  I value harmony and smooth interactions more than winning an argument.

Moving away from home and attending UT Austin, a huge university with a vibrant campus, completely changed my perspective.

I'm eager to explore all the opportunities this new environment offers.","Balancing pledgeship, the business honors program, and maintaining a high GPA is my current major challenge, requiring intense time management.

I ended up getting the tickets later, which was rewarding.","Getting my new apartment organized after a month of homelessness was a huge goal that demanded a lot of effort.  I prioritized getting things done (dentist appointment, bills paid, etc.) methodically throughout the day, breaking it down into manageable tasks.

The anticipation, the shared excitement, and the collective energy of the concert are all huge parts of this.  I thrive in social situations with my close friends, finding it fulfilling and reaffirming.","The essay doesn't show any major conflict, but my tendency to prioritize my own plans and goals suggests I might have difficulty prioritizing others' needs in conflict.  I may need to work on that area of my life.","The stress of homelessness and the pressure of getting everything done is a prime example.

Overall, I tend to stick to what I know.","Saving for a down payment on a new car is a major goal requiring sustained effort.  I'm trying to balance work, school, and saving, but I’m struggling.  Time management is a weakness; I procrastinate on studying, prioritizing immediate needs like sleep and work. Although I recognize the need for good grades to get financial assistance for the car, my inconsistent effort highlights my struggle with prioritization and self-discipline.  The reward would be a new car, but the challenge is managing everything else.","Working the Matchbox 20 concert is a social experience, but it's more of a job than a purely social event. The interaction is draining because I'm exhausted. I am energized by close relationships but large crowds, especially when I'm tired, are not my thing. I need my alone time to recharge.  This reinforces my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings.","I haven't had many explicit disagreements in the essay; however, the general tone reflects a low agreeableness. My complaints about 6th Street and my lack of effort in school suggest a resistance to compromise and external expectations.  I prioritize my immediate needs and desires over external pressures, suggesting a less agreeable approach to conflict.","My essay is full of stress and anxiety.  The blisters, the work schedule, the concert, and even the laundry all contribute to my feeling overwhelmed.

The energy of the college experience has pushed me to explore new social situations, meet a ton of people (even if I can't always remember their names!), and navigate a demanding academic schedule.","Balancing everything in college has been a real challenge.  I’ve had to develop strategies to manage my time effectively—primarily by fitting in studying between classes and social events. I don't really have a strict schedule but I do manage to get everything done, somehow.  I'm learning to prioritize, but it's definitely a work in progress.

I really enjoy going out and meeting new people, even though remembering everyone’s name is a struggle!  However, sometimes this social whirlwind can be draining, and I crave alone time to recharge.

1261,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  The essay shows I'm more focused on familiar comforts (chocolate!), and I'm not one for radical changes in thinking or environment. However, starting college was a new environment and, although daunting, the excitement of meeting new people and having new opportunities pushed me to embrace the challenge. Afterwards, I felt a mix of exhilaration and anxiety, which the essay clearly reflects.","I struggle with sustained effort toward long-term goals, as evidenced by my procrastination and lack of consistent exercise despite wanting to lose weight.  My time management isn't great; I let assignments pile up and spend a lot of time sleeping or avoiding tasks. When challenges arise, I often avoid them, which makes me feel guilty and further reinforces this negative pattern.  Rewarding aspects are nonexistent due to lack of effort.","Energetic social experiences are my forte.  The essay hints at my enjoyment of being around friends (Si Nae Kim) and the excitement of a new college social scene.  Meeting my ex-boyfriend was an unexpected and somewhat draining social experience, highlighting my need for stimulating, positive interactions and an aversion to potentially negative encounters that bring about unwanted emotions. I thrive in positive, upbeat social settings.","I generally try to avoid conflict. The essay doesn't show any examples of major disagreements, and I can presume from my overall personality I would prioritize maintaining harmony in relationships when faced with a disagreement. My approach might involve trying to find common ground or agreeing to disagree, rather than engaging in a direct confrontation.","Stress and anxiety are significant recurring themes in the essay. My initial response to stress is often avoidance (procrastination, indulging in chocolate) and overthinking.  I worry about academics, weight, and social situations.  I seem to manage my emotions mainly by distracting myself, as seen in my jumping from one thought to the next, but I lack concrete coping mechanisms for longer-term stress relief.",n,n,y,y,y
1262,"I've always been fascinated by the unknown, and that curiosity led me to attend a rave.  While I didn't partake in the drug use, the sheer energy and intensity of the experience were unlike anything I’d ever encountered before.  It pushed me outside my comfort zone and, although it wasn't entirely my scene, it definitely broadened my perspective on different subcultures and social events. Afterward, I felt a mixture of exhilaration and a little bit of exhaustion, but it was a unique and memorable experience.","I'm not the most organized person.  Honestly, I struggle with long-term goals, and I often find myself procrastinating.  For example, I haven't made much of an effort to learn about the long-term effects of ecstasy, despite my interest. I tend to react to situations rather than proactively planning for them. This impulsive nature is a challenge, but it also leads to exciting experiences.  Ultimately, I wish I was more proactive.","The rave was a truly memorable social experience. Surrounded by hundreds of people, many of whom were high on ecstasy, the energy was palpable. Although the overwhelming amount of activity and dancing did invigorate me to some degree,  I also found myself craving alone time afterward. The experience confirmed my need for balance between social interaction and solitude; I realized I thrive on the energy of social events, but too much of it can be overstimulating.","I haven't had many significant disagreements with others recently. The situation with J is more of a complicated dynamic than a direct conflict. Because I am scared to ask him about our relationship status, I haven't done anything to actively resolve the problem. It leaves me feeling anxious, but also a bit excited about the possibility of something developing.","The whole situation with J and my anxieties about my friends' ecstasy use are pretty stressful.  My immediate reaction is often worry and overthinking. However, I attempt to manage my emotions by talking to friends and journaling, focusing on the positives (like my feelings for J). This approach helps me approach these situations constructively.",y,n,y,n,y
1263,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The whole college experience is new enough for me!  I guess moving away from home and going to UT was a big change, but it was more about escaping a situation than seeking out novelty. I'm mostly focused on figuring out this new environment and adjusting to the freedom, rather than actively experimenting with different things.","Honestly, I haven't really set any long-term goals for myself yet. I'm more focused on enjoying the freedom and figuring out college life. My time management is, well, still a work in progress!  I'm trying to make the most of this new independence, even if it means a less structured approach. The reward is definitely the freedom, though the challenge is getting used to all this responsibility and making sure I don't get into too much trouble!","Going out clubbing sounds fun, but organizing it stresses me out. I love meeting people and having fun, but being around large groups for extended periods drains me. I value my close friends and smaller social circles more. I feel really energized by smaller, more intimate interactions with those I'm close to, where I don't feel the pressure to constantly socialize.","I've had some disagreements with people here already over club choices and who’s driving. My priority is usually to avoid confrontation, but sometimes I do need to assert my preferences. I might go along with things to keep the peace, but I try to find a balance of maintaining my own preferences and avoiding conflict. I don't like causing issues.","The thought of my parents finding out if I get in trouble is incredibly stressful.  I generally try to avoid risky situations to prevent causing worry for them.  When I'm stressed, I tend to focus on what I can control, figuring out logistics for getting around and avoiding any problems that would bring extra attention.  I usually handle it by focusing on the immediate problem to avoid getting overwhelmed.",n,n,y,n,n
1264,"I recently decided to try stand-up paddleboarding.  I'd always enjoyed being on the water, and the idea of a peaceful, active pursuit intrigued me. The experience was surprisingly enjoyable; I felt a sense of accomplishment and found it to be a relaxing way to appreciate nature. The whole thing was a lot of fun.","My goal of graduating with honors required diligent planning and time management. I created a detailed schedule, prioritized tasks, and utilized various productivity techniques, such as the Pomodoro method.  While there were times I felt overwhelmed, breaking down large assignments into smaller, manageable steps and rewarding myself for milestones kept me motivated. The satisfaction of achieving that goal was very rewarding.","A memorable social experience that left me feeling drained was a large, crowded party. The noise and constant social interaction proved overwhelming, making it hard to have meaningful conversations. I prefer smaller gatherings where I can connect with people on a deeper level, this solidified that. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings.","I once disagreed with a friend about a political issue.  Rather than engaging in an argument, I focused on understanding their perspective and highlighting our common ground.  My priority was maintaining our friendship, which is more valuable than winning the argument. I was able to express my disagreement respectfully, showing them that we can have different opinions without it affecting our friendship.","During a particularly stressful exam period, I initially felt anxious and overwhelmed.  To manage this, I implemented stress-reducing techniques such as exercise, meditation, and spending time with loved ones.  Breaking the workload into smaller portions and focusing on one task at a time proved beneficial. By taking these constructive actions, I was able to approach the exams with a clearer head and better manage my anxiety.",y,y,n,y,n
1265,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they make me feel a little uneasy.  Recently, I decided to try rock climbing, something completely outside my comfort zone.  The motivation was a desire to challenge myself and push past my anxieties. While initially terrifying, the feeling of accomplishment afterward was incredible.  It reinforced the idea that stepping outside my usual routine can be surprisingly rewarding.","Setting and maintaining goals isn't really my forte.  I tend to be more spontaneous, and structured plans often feel restrictive.  When I do commit to something, it's usually because of a strong personal connection, not rigid scheduling. I've learned that being flexible and forgiving of myself is more effective for me than trying to force myself to stick to a strict plan.  The most rewarding part is achieving something that felt impossible at the start.","Large social gatherings can be extremely draining.  I find myself retreating afterward, needing time to recharge.  The most energizing interactions are with a close circle of people where I feel comfortable being myself.  It’s made me appreciate the importance of intimacy and quality interactions over large-scale social events; intense socializing depletes my energy stores far more than I’d prefer.","Disagreements often leave me feeling unsettled and needing to process the conflict for a considerable period of time. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, preferring to first thoroughly process my thoughts and feelings before addressing any issues.  My priority isn't always ""winning"" the argument but rather finding a solution that respects both perspectives, even if it means compromising or leaving the issue unresolved.  The process of reaching a decision can take far longer than others are comfortable waiting for, resulting in them finding it difficult to understand my approach.","Anxiety and stress are familiar companions.  My initial response is often to withdraw and overthink, leading to a downward spiral.  However, I've learned that getting outside and changing my environment – even for a short time – helps immensely. Talking to someone I trust also provides crucial support. Ultimately, I've found that while there are many ways to cope with these difficult experiences, self-reflection and finding healthy outlets are essential for me to improve my responses and improve my mental health.",y,n,y,n,y
1266,"I wouldn't say I'm one for wildly new experiences.  My life is pretty structured right now, focused on getting into nursing school.  I guess the biggest change recently was breaking up with my boyfriend and finding a new social circle, though even that felt more like shedding something old than embracing something radically new. It definitely feels like a change for the better, though.","Getting into nursing school is my huge goal right now. To stay on track, I'm meticulously managing my time –  making detailed schedules and prioritizing my studies.  It's challenging balancing everything – school, bills, family responsibilities – but staying organized and focused is key.  The reward will be worth the effort.","Large, boisterous social gatherings totally drain me.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  My recent breakup has reinforced this;  I find much more energy and fulfillment in spending quiet time alone or with my family, rather than being around a big group of people.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I often try to find common ground or simply let things go, unless it significantly impacts me. My priorities are usually maintaining peace and avoiding conflict, even if it means compromising my own perspective.","Today, I’m feeling incredibly stressed about school and finances. My initial reaction is anxiety, but I try to manage it by making lists, planning my day, and reminding myself of my goals.  Focusing on my progress and trusting in God helps me move forward more constructively.",n,y,y,n,y
1267,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person when it comes to radically new experiences.  While I enjoy familiar things like listening to Simon & Garfunkel and cheering at football games, I'm generally more comfortable sticking to what I know. The essay reflects this preference for routine and familiar activities.  Trying something completely new doesn't really figure into my current priorities.","Getting a 4.0 GPA this semester is a major goal. To achieve this, I focus on efficient time management – staying on campus between classes to avoid wasted travel time and prioritizing my studies. I meticulously track my schedule to ensure I keep up with coursework, even adjusting my clock to match my computer. Challenges include moments of procrastination, like the night I goofed off instead of studying, but my commitment to academic success overrides these distractions.","The Delta Pledge party was a memorable social experience that energized me. It was a welcome break from my usual routine of studying and provided a much-needed change of pace.  The positive energy of the party fulfilled my social needs, however,  most of my time is spent with myself or a few close friends. The essay does suggest a preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings, rather than large or very frequent social situations.","I haven't described any major conflicts in the essay, but I would say my approach is to focus on keeping the peace and maintaining positive relationships. It's certainly not my preference to be in conflict with anyone.   The essay reflects a positive and unconflicted attitude overall, even in situations requiring adjustments (like getting a book receipt).","While I mention feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork and tired at the end of a long day, I don't express significant anxiety or stress.  My response to stress is largely practical:  I adjust my schedule, try to stay on top of things, and generally maintain a positive attitude, which is reflected in the positive outlook of the essay. The essay demonstrates an ability to cope with daily stressors without expressing excessive worry or negativity.",n,y,y,y,n
1268,"Trying a completely new activity is something I do fairly often. Starting college has been a whirlwind of new experiences, new people, and new ways of thinking.  I was motivated by the desire for excitement and the thrill of the unknown, embracing the freedom and fun of being a freshman. Overall, it's been overwhelmingly positive, although sometimes I do miss the familiarity of my old life and the deep connections I had before.","Balancing academics, social life, and a long-distance relationship isn't always easy.  I haven't had much success in creating a strict schedule that helps me stay organized.  The thrill of college and the new friends I make tends to take precedent over my studying and homework.  While I know I should prioritize my schoolwork, I often prioritize enjoying my new life.","A memorable social experience was the first time meeting my new college friends. The energy of our conversations, laughing, and making plans was exhilarating. I feel energized by social interaction, and it shapes my understanding of my need for connection and social stimulation.","I recently had a disagreement with my boyfriend about our relationship and the distance between us. While we both want what is best for each other, we are facing challenges due to our circumstances. To resolve this, I prioritized open and honest communication, valuing both of our feelings. While I disagree with his decision to go to the Naval Academy, I understand that it's his life and choice.","Feeling stressed and anxious about my relationship and my adjustment to college life is common. I initially respond with a desire to talk it out with my boyfriend or friends and to try and get some distraction. When I need to solve problems, though, I make sure to do so calmly and rationally.",y,n,y,y,y
1269,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a little unconventional.  Last year, I took a literature class that required a stream-of-consciousness writing assignment—something completely outside my comfort zone.  The motivation was mostly the assignment itself, but the experience was surprisingly freeing, a way to explore my thoughts without the usual constraints of structure and editing.  Afterwards, I felt a little exposed, but also strangely satisfied.","While I aim to do well,  I don't necessarily approach goals with meticulous planning. My essay shows I'm more reactive than proactive. For instance,  I started college, not really thinking much about the transition or strategizing ahead of time. I found that the beginning-of-the-year drive for good grades was very unsustainable, not a plan I could count on.  It was more ""crazy initiative"" than steady effort. I prefer adapting and finding my way organically, rather than having a rigid strategy.","Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer smaller interactions. The essay reflects my feelings about the ""buzzing"" behavior of college kids.  It's more of an annoyance than anything else. My energy is better spent alone or with a small group of close friends. I find large parties overwhelming and prefer quieter, more intimate settings.","Disagreements are uncomfortable. I tend to avoid direct confrontation. I am practical, my essay demonstrates that. My priority is often maintaining peace, even if it means compromising my own views.  I might not always be assertive in expressing my opinion, preferring to find common ground rather than engage in a protracted conflict.","Stress and anxiety manifest as avoidance and self-reflection, as shown in my essay. For example, the prospect of speaking Spanish worries me.  My initial response is often to internalize my feelings; however, I recognize that's not always constructive,  so I use writing as a way to process these feelings and gain perspective. I am trying to work on this, as my essay reveals.",y,n,n,n,y
1270,"I recently decided against joining a fraternity, a path I'd always envisioned for myself.  This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision; I'd been internally wrestling with the commitment and its potential clash with my academic goals.  Ultimately, choosing a different path felt liberating, even though I miss some social aspects.  It reinforced my need to prioritize personal values over social expectations.","My goal to excel academically requires consistent effort.  I manage my time by creating schedules and prioritizing tasks, though I sometimes struggle to stick to them perfectly.  My biggest challenge is balancing academic work with social activities.  It's rewarding to see progress in my studies but frustrating when distractions derail my plans. The reward is the satisfaction of seeing my efforts pay off.","Spending a night watching a movie with a girl I used to date was a fairly draining experience.  I value quiet time, and while I can enjoy social interactions, overly stimulating ones often leave me feeling depleted.  This experience confirmed my preference for smaller, more intimate social gatherings. My inclination is towards introspection.","I often avoid direct conflict. The essay mentions my annoyance at my friend's computer not working properly, which I kept to myself, rather than expressing my annoyance directly. I value avoiding confrontations and maintaining pleasant relationships, however I do not see myself as lacking in asserting my own desires and needs.","The heat in the room is stressing me out, making it difficult to focus. I try to manage it by taking breaks and focusing on the things I'm looking forward to, such as the Dave Matthews concert. Ultimately, I cope with my discomfort through such coping mechanisms, and by refocusing my attention elsewhere.",y,y,n,n,n

My focus has been entirely on navigating this new and overwhelming environment, and dealing with my relationship issues.  Frankly, I haven't had the mental space to consider anything beyond my immediate problems.","I’m incredibly focused on academics. Juggling classes, making new friends, and dealing with the emotional fallout of my relationship is quite the balancing act. I'm keeping track of my assignments, but I'm struggling to feel in control amidst all the change. I am definitely not used to this much change and I think that if I can keep my head above water, I will be successful!","Social interactions have been largely draining. Rush week was particularly difficult, ending in rejection which only added to my existing stress.  My interactions are largely limited to my new roommates, who aren't really my type of people.  I prefer deeper, more meaningful connections, rather than the superficial interactions that I have been experiencing.","My disagreement with Matt is consuming me. I feel deeply hurt and misunderstood.  I haven’t been able to effectively communicate my feelings to him, because the distance has created an insurmountable barrier.  I'm prioritizing my emotional well-being, and allowing myself to grieve this relationship.","My first week of college has been overwhelmingly stressful. The combination of relationship problems, sorority rejection, and the general anxieties of a new environment have left me feeling incredibly vulnerable and anxious. I’m trying to cope by venting to my friends and distracting myself with whatever I can manage.",n,y,n,n,n
1272,"I haven't actively sought out dramatically new experiences; my comfort zone is pretty well-defined.  However, moving to a new country has, by necessity, exposed me to new cultures and ways of life.  While initially intimidating, the experience has prompted me to question some of my deeply held beliefs and consider alternative perspectives, even if I haven't fully embraced them yet. The whole process has been more unsettling than exciting.","I struggle with long-term goals.  I often start with good intentions but find it difficult to maintain consistent effort.  I lack the discipline for detailed planning or resource management; I tend to operate more reactively than proactively.  While I occasionally experience the satisfaction of achieving a short-term goal, sustained effort towards larger objectives remains a persistent challenge.","Social interactions are generally draining for me.  Large groups, particularly those with strangers, leave me feeling overwhelmed and anxious.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I know well, where I feel comfortable and less pressured to participate extensively.  My preference for solitude reflects a need for introspection and time to recharge.","When disagreeing with someone, I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  I prioritize maintaining harmony and avoiding conflict.  However, this approach sometimes leads to unresolved issues or unspoken resentments.  Finding a balance between respecting others' opinions and expressing my own remains a work in progress.","Stress and anxiety manifest as self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy.

1273,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new since arriving in America.  My life has mostly revolved around adapting to this new environment and academic system. While I'm curious about new experiences, I tend to prefer familiarity and predictability, which is probably why I haven't actively sought out completely novel situations.  Even writing this essay is a bit of a departure from my routine, and it's left me feeling somewhat flustered.","I set a goal of maintaining a decent GPA, despite the challenges of this new education system and my tendency to procrastinate.  My strategy involves prioritizing assignments due on Thursdays, when I have only one class. However, this clearly isn't sustainable; as I constantly end up delaying work until the very last minute, which is stressful. This has taught me the value of better time management and a less haphazard approach to studying.","Large classrooms and a lack of one-to-one interaction drain my energy.  I value my close relationships with my friends back home; that kind of close, personal interaction is really fulfilling, but the large and impersonal American school environment isn't. I miss the personal connections I had before coming here, and it makes me crave more intimate social settings.","I haven't had any major disagreements since arriving here, but I'd probably avoid conflict whenever possible.  I wouldn't want to rock the boat or upset anybody, particularly my professors.  I suppose maintaining good relationships with my teachers takes priority, even if it means occasionally swallowing my opinions or concerns.","I feel stressed easily.  The uncertainty of this new environment, along with the fear of forgetting assignments or annoying my professors, causes me anxiety.  When feeling overwhelmed, I tend to put things off, which only exacerbates the stress. I deal with this stress by daydreaming of simpler times, like the comfort of my home in India, and fantasizing about getting a sports car.

I haven't developed effective time management strategies, often leaving tasks until the deadline looms.  I find the lack of organization challenging, and while the pressure can be stressful, the eventual completion provides a sense of relief.","Eating alone is something I've come to accept, though I do sometimes feel a pang of loneliness when surrounded by socializing groups.  This social interaction can be both energizing and draining, depending on the dynamics and my emotional state that day.  It has highlighted the need for balance between my preference for solitude and the desire for connection.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out, and I tend to avoid direct confrontation.

Although challenging, it's incredibly rewarding to see progress.","Spending time with my boyfriend is always energizing.  The shared laughter, intimate conversations, and simple acts of affection fill me with happiness.  Conversely, periods of separation leave me feeling drained and longing for connection. This experience has highlighted my need for strong, supportive relationships.","Disagreements haven't really come up with my boyfriend, but I always aim for open communication. My priority is understanding his perspective, even if it differs from mine.

I prefer routine and predictability.","I struggle with staying focused on long-term goals. My time management could definitely use improvement; I often get sidetracked, especially when feeling anxious. The stress of this class is a perfect example. While I know I should be dedicating time to it, I find myself procrastinating.  I get easily overwhelmed when things aren’t going as planned.","Social interaction leaves me feeling drained rather than energized.  Even simple conversations can feel exhausting. My roommate’s mother calling him every night is much more interaction than I'm comfortable with.  The essay shows how little I've spoken to my own family, highlighting my preference for solitude. I generally avoid large gatherings and prefer the company of my dog, whom I miss deeply.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, partly because it increases my anxiety.  My lack of communication with my parents reveals how difficult it is for me to address conflict.

To stay on track, I broke the task into smaller, manageable pieces and prioritized them based on deadlines. While dealing with a sore throat and other issues made it challenging, I managed to get it done on time. The satisfaction of completing the assignment despite obstacles was very rewarding.","Social situations can be either energizing or draining, depending on the people involved and the setting.

I’m curious to see what else might surprise me.","I definitely struggle with staying on top of things.  While I set goals, like keeping up with my Sunday routine for my mom, I often fall short due to exhaustion, socializing, or simply not having the motivation.

This inconsistency is something I'm working on, but it's challenging.","Social situations can be a mixed bag for me.  While I enjoy going out and meeting new people –  and the prospect of someone having to carry me home from a night out excites me –  I can also feel drained after interactions, especially if I haven't gotten enough sleep or if the conversation is forced, like with those Christians on Campus.

I haven't explicitly addressed a disagreement in this essay, but based on my feelings about my ex-girlfriend and my desire for a casual relationship, I prefer harmony but will do what I need to feel better, even if it's not a considerate choice.","I experience stress and anxiety, especially when I'm broke or overwhelmed with school and work.

The quality of the interaction, rather than quantity, is crucial for me.","I tend to avoid direct conflict, but I'm willing to discuss disagreements.  While the essay mentions my skepticism towards some men's behavior, I generally try to understand different perspectives. My priority is to maintain positive relationships.  Rather than forcing my views, I aim for mutual respect and understanding.","I experience anxiety occasionally, especially regarding significant decisions like marriage proposals. I manage my stress by relying on my supportive relationship with my girlfriend.  Spending time with her, doing things we both enjoy, calms my nerves and helps me approach challenges with a clearer mind.  I am more comfortable with self-reflection and seeking resolutions to anxiety rather than suppressing it.",y,y,n,n,n
1281,"I'm not one for radically new experiences.  My life is pretty structured, and I prefer the familiar. While I haven't tried anything drastically different,  the prospect of college at UT, though a big change, feels more like a natural progression than a leap into the unknown. My motivation is primarily the next step in my life plan and the excitement of the future.","Balancing school, my faith, and relationships requires careful planning. I create to-do lists and try to prioritize tasks, though sometimes my mind wanders! I find that connecting with my best friend Kristen is a crucial part of my emotional well-being, which, in turn, helps me stay focused on goals.  The challenge is maintaining discipline amid distractions, yet the reward is the sense of accomplishment when I meet my goals.","Being around my best friend Kristen always energizes me; her presence provides comfort and understanding. I thrive in close, supportive relationships, rather than large, boisterous gatherings.  Conversely, interactions with people who are negative or draining leave me feeling depleted and in need of quiet time to recharge. My social needs center on deep connection over broad socialization.","I am more focused on maintaining my relationships with those who bring positivity. Conflict avoidance is often my approach, but I don't necessarily shy away from confrontation if the situation calls for it. My priority in resolving conflict is preserving harmony and maintaining meaningful connections.  My faith guides me in how I should act and react with those who I may not agree with.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a racing mind, jumping from worry to worry. To manage these feelings, I turn to prayer and conversation with Kristen or other supportive friends.  Maintaining a balance of faith and focusing on my relationship with Christ helps me return to emotional balance and a constructive outlook.",n,y,y,n,n
1282,"I wouldn't say I've ever actively sought out something completely new, at least not intentionally. It seems like change is thrust upon me more than I choose it.  Being in college, away from home, is certainly a new environment, but I wouldn't call it something I actively *chose*. It’s more of an obligation, something that's happened *to* me. It's stressful and overwhelming, but I suppose in some ways, it has been a kind of learning experience, albeit unintentionally.","Setting goals isn't really my strong suit; things tend to fall apart if they aren't already scheduled or extremely structured. I really struggle to manage my time and resources efficiently. I often feel like I'm falling behind, which makes me feel even more anxious and disorganized. I know I *should* plan better, but the very thought of organizing my life feels incredibly daunting and overwhelming. Even simple tasks feel like insurmountable mountains sometimes.","Social interactions are generally draining. I don't have much energy to give, and large social events leave me feeling completely exhausted, even when surrounded by people I care about. This is especially true if there's a lot of pressure to perform, to be funny, or otherwise engage in ways that feel inauthentic. Smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends are less tiring but even those have their limits. I crave alone time to recharge.","Disagreements are stressful. I tend to avoid direct confrontation if at all possible. If I can't completely evade a conflict, I try to express my feelings as calmly as I can, usually focusing on finding a compromise to smooth things over as quickly as possible. Direct conflict is just too upsetting.  Prioritizing my own emotional well-being comes first in these situations.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions for me.  I often react initially by becoming overwhelmed, which usually leads to procrastination or avoidance. Getting my emotions under control takes conscious effort. Usually, listening to music or journaling helps me to feel a bit better. Yet, some anxiety always seems to linger.",n,n,n,n,y
1283,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person.  Most new experiences are things I’m pushed into rather than actively seeking out.  For example, college itself was a huge change that I initially resisted, but I eventually found myself adapting to the necessity of interacting with so many new people. While I don't particularly enjoy the experience, I acknowledge that it's been unavoidable and somewhat beneficial in a way.","I'm generally a pretty organized person, though not always in a way that others might see as efficient. I always make a point of prioritizing my responsibilities in a way that gets things done, whether it’s setting deadlines for myself or using planners to stay on top of things. While I can be quite effective, the pressure to succeed sometimes fuels my stress and anxiety.  The rewarding aspect is that I do generally get things completed, though sometimes it takes a toll on my emotional well being.","Social situations tend to leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  Large gatherings or extended conversations exhaust me.  Even with close friends, extended interactions can overwhelm me. I think this is just my nature, and I’ve come to accept it. While I value my friendships, I need time alone to recharge.  College has forced me to interact more than I’d prefer, but it hasn’t altered my fundamental preference for quieter settings.","Disagreements aren't easy for me; I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible.  I usually try to find a compromise, even if it means sacrificing my own preferences. This isn't always ideal, as I sometimes end up feeling resentful. My priority is maintaining a peaceful relationship, even if it means not fully expressing my own opinions.  I need to work on being more assertive in the future.","Stress is a constant companion for me; the last couple of years of college have been particularly challenging in this regard.  I respond to stress by becoming tense, moody, and losing my appetite. I've tried to manage it by keeping organized and prioritizing tasks, but it isn't always effective. My anxiety often stems from indecision and feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of having to make the right choice. I recognize this is a problem and hope to improve it, but change is hard.",n,y,n,n,y
1284,"I don’t really like trying new things.  This whole essay-writing thing is a prime example; it feels forced and unnatural.  I'd much rather stick to what I know and am comfortable with. I suppose the motivation was the assignment, but I definitely wasn't thrilled with the experience.","I don't really set goals, and I'm not someone who's naturally organized.  If something needs to get done, I'll usually get it done eventually, but I don't plan things out meticulously or set deadlines.  I don't find that kind of approach particularly rewarding. The challenge is more that I don't even see the need to put in sustained effort.","Large social gatherings drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to. The essay shows that; I mentioned wanting to see my friend Chela on Friday, rather than being a social butterfly.  Overwhelming social situations are exhausting, and I’d much rather have quiet time alone.","I try to avoid conflict as much as possible. If there's a disagreement, I’ll generally try to find some common ground, even if it means compromising on my own preferences. It's easier that way.  My priority is to keep things peaceful and avoid upsetting others.","I'm not usually stressed. If I do get stressed, I tend to withdraw a bit, focus on things I like (like painting my nails), and just wait for it to pass. I don't overthink situations or dwell on negative emotions, finding that an easy enough way to manage any potential anxiety.",n,n,n,y,n

The whole college experience feels different from what I expected, and I'm not sure if that's because of me or the environment.  Honestly, I'm questioning if this is even the right place for me.","Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't something I excel at.  My plans for college are pretty vague, and I haven't really developed any concrete strategies to navigate it.  I'm struggling to find a sense of direction, and even simple tasks feel overwhelming at times. The uncertainty makes focusing on anything very difficult.","Social situations, especially large ones, often leave me feeling drained. I came here hoping to connect with others but finding those genuine connections has been difficult.  Even when I meet new people, it doesn't feel like I can really get close to them.  I think I need more introverted time to recharge.","Disagreements are tough for me. I tend to avoid conflict and often keep my opinions to myself, especially when I'm surrounded by unfamiliar people.  The different social dynamics here at UT are causing some friction, but I'm not entirely sure how to address it without causing more issues. I want to find harmony, but that is hard.","I worry a lot.  The uncertainty of college life, being away from my friends, and the overall feeling of not fitting in have made me very anxious.  I overthink everything, and my anxieties often spiral out of control.  I know that worrying isn't productive, but it's a difficult habit to break.

1286,"I don't often seek out radically new experiences; I'm more comfortable with the familiar.  However, in high school, I took a psychology class that was quite different from my other subjects. While initially hesitant, the teacher's enthusiasm was infectious and made the subject engaging.  I found the material interesting, though I don't actively seek out new experiences beyond what's already presented to me.","I struggle with long-term goals.  My ROTC obligations, and the many other tasks I have, often mean that I procrastinate and leave things to the last minute. I have a very difficult time maintaining time and resource management, and end up rushing through tasks without much planning. I find it particularly challenging to balance competing demands on my time, as evidenced by my current writing situation.","Large social gatherings leave me drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  The ROTC ceremony is a prime example of a situation that exhausts me.  I find it challenging to engage in extended periods of social interaction. This essay demonstrates this with my constant references to time constraints and my desire to move on to the next activity.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict.  If a disagreement arises, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself rather than engage in a lengthy discussion. My priority is efficiency and getting tasks done quickly, so prolonged conflict is something that I try to avoid at all costs, resulting in a lack of thorough exploration of different perspectives.","Deadlines and a busy schedule stress me out. My immediate response is to rush to finish tasks, often leading to poor quality of work, as seen in this assignment. My strategy for managing this is to just power through it.  Ultimately, this leads to further stress and a sense of being overwhelmed.",y,n,n,y,n

While it's challenging, the small victories I experience each day are surprisingly rewarding.","I've been working on improving my time management skills. I use a planner to schedule my day, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.  Sticking to this schedule has been challenging; there are always distractions, but the sense of accomplishment I feel when I complete my planned tasks makes the effort worthwhile.  The biggest challenge is dealing with unexpected events that disrupt my carefully planned schedule.",Spending time with Saurin was energizing.  His humor and easygoing nature made the interaction enjoyable. It reinforced my need for social interaction with people who share similar senses of humor and energy.  I feel drained in environments with little stimulation or too much negativity.,"I try to approach disagreements with an understanding of where other people are coming from.  If I'm wrong, I am readily willing to admit it. My priority is to reach a mutual understanding, even if we don't entirely agree, and to maintain the relationship.","Feeling tired and overwhelmed is a common experience for me. When this happens, I try to take a break, listen to music, or spend time with friends to alleviate the stress and anxiety. It is a constant struggle to find the right balance, but these steps help me approach my tasks with a clearer head.",y,y,y,y,n
1288,"I recently decided to try stream-of-consciousness writing, which was completely new to me.  I was motivated by a desire to just express myself freely and without editing.  Afterwards, I felt surprisingly good; it was cathartic to let my thoughts flow uninhibited.","I struggle with procrastination, as my essay reveals.  For instance, I didn't respond to an email from Annie for two weeks. I often lack effective time management strategies, relying on spur-of-the-moment inspiration rather than structured planning.  I find the lack of discipline frustrating, but the occasional bursts of productivity are rewarding.","My interactions with Natalie (Salina) and Amy are energizing. These are friendships based on mutual appreciation. The connections I make with people I admire and find attractive give me energy, while interactions with people I dislike drain me. This tells me that I thrive in positive, appreciative social environments and need to limit interactions with those who don't share that energy.","My attitude toward Jared and Dom is certainly not agreeable. I harbor resentment due to past experiences.  Instead of addressing conflicts directly, I tend to distance myself and let time heal things. My priority is self-preservation and maintaining my emotional well-being.","The stress of irregular sleep and academic pressures clearly affects me, but it's managed through writing and venting my thoughts.

My motivation stemmed from a desire to challenge myself creatively and physically, and it proved to be a remarkably fulfilling experience;  I discovered a hidden passion, a form of self-expression I hadn't realized I possessed. It’s also helped me escape the anxieties I’ve been feeling lately.","Preparing for the Olympics has required intense dedication and rigorous training.  I've implemented a strict schedule, prioritizing training and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  While there have been moments of doubt and fatigue, setting smaller, attainable goals has kept me focused and helped me celebrate small victories along the way.  The most challenging aspect was balancing training with the emotional turmoil of my family situation, but seeing how much progress I’ve made keeps me going.","Participating in dance competitions are often extremely energizing social experiences.  The collaborative energy, shared passion, and supportive atmosphere created by fellow dancers lifts my spirits and provides a wonderful sense of community.  Conversely, large social gatherings outside of dance, can leave me feeling drained; I find smaller, more intimate interactions are more fulfilling. This understanding has taught me to prioritize quality over quantity in my social life.","I find that my overly kind heart, as I described, often leads to conflicts because I struggle to assert my needs. In disagreements, I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective before expressing my own. This sometimes makes resolving conflicts challenging.  I'm still learning to find a balance between empathy and self-advocacy.","The recent divorce of my parents has been incredibly stressful.  Initially, I suppressed my emotions, focusing on being strong for my family. However, I recognized that suppressing them was not effective; writing has become a constructive outlet for my anxieties.  It allows me to process my feelings without overwhelming myself.",y,y,y,y,n

It was a spontaneous decision, driven by curiosity and a desire to break free from the monotony of my life.  The experience was intense and left me feeling reflective and a little disoriented for some time, but ultimately helped to calm down that wild madness I was experiencing.","I haven't exactly been the most organized individual, but I do value consistent effort in certain aspects of my life. My academic performance consistently shows a certain amount of conscientiousness, and despite the general chaos of my life, I do manage to maintain a certain level of academic success. I'm not always successful in sticking to goals, and while I often procrastinate, it's not for lack of awareness of the importance of consistency. My life is mostly dictated by the ebbs and flows of events, but I do aim to maintain a certain level of academic achievement.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining.  Spending time with my close friends, like Elizabeth, is always revitalizing, creating positive memories like the one at the Doubletree last Christmas.  On the other hand, my encounter with Sue ended up being incredibly draining and emotionally taxing, highlighting my need for more careful selection of my romantic partners.","Disagreements can be challenging. My relationship with Sue demonstrated this, as I prioritized my immediate desires over her feelings, resulting in a regrettable situation.  I’m not exactly known for being agreeable, and often I prioritize my own needs and desires over those of others.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently.

It used to be normal, but now that I've been sharing a room for just three weeks, it feels a little unusual and unsettling.","I'm not the most organized person.  I completely missed my philosophy discussion today because I didn't plan my time well, prioritizing going out the night before over my responsibilities.  I'm working on improving this; my roommate's reminder was a wake-up call.  But I am dedicated to my friends and will do my best to make sure I get everything done on time for them, including attending the OU game with my friend.","Going out with my friends the night before my discussion group is definitely energizing.  Being around people I enjoy being around and having fun together always gives me a burst of energy. However, spending a weekend alone will be a challenge, given my current social habits. I'm beginning to understand that I need a good balance between social interaction and alone time, even if I haven't figured it out completely yet.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but I am concerned about my friend rejoining his fraternity.  I respected his decision to leave, and his going back makes me uneasy.  I’ll probably just observe the situation and voice my concerns if he seems unhappy with his decision, but I would not want to interfere too much in his personal life.","Waking up with a swollen eye stressed me out this morning.  It’s not painful, but the constant discomfort is annoying and unsettling.

The biggest ""new thing"" recently was undergoing surgery and extensive treatment—that was certainly unexpected and forced upon me, not something I actively sought out.  While it was terrifying, it also led to some personal growth, which is a surprising silver lining.","Staying on top of my medication regimen has been a huge goal for me. It requires taking 17 pills a day, remembering appointments, and tracking my symptoms. I use pill organizers and set reminders on my phone to stay on schedule.  It's been incredibly challenging and exhausting, but rewarding because it's vital to my health and well-being. The constant effort, however, is definitely draining.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.  I get overwhelmed easily in big crowds, and I feel the need to withdraw and recharge afterward. My ideal social experience involves meaningful conversations with a few trusted friends or loved ones.

I usually try to express my feelings directly, but my attempts at open communication often go unreturned.  My priority is understanding his perspective, and I often feel like I'm battling against the lack of communication on his side, rather than resolving a conflict through mutual discussion.  It's frustrating and makes me question the relationship.","I experience stress and anxiety often, particularly regarding my health and my relationship.  My initial response is often frustration and worry, but I try to cope by praying, leaning on my support system, and focusing on the positive aspects of my life.  The uncertainty surrounding my health and my boyfriend's feelings are huge contributors to my anxiety.  I am trying to use constructive coping mechanisms but it is often difficult.",n,y,y,n,y

My current focus is on simply getting through the initial adjustment period to college rather than setting and achieving large, long-term goals. The challenge right now is managing this overwhelming feeling of homesickness and adjusting to this new life.","Going out to eat with my mom and sisters was energizing, a welcome break from the stress of adjusting to college.

My priority is to maintain positive relationships and to approach any conflicts with a calm and patient manner.  I avoid confrontation, preferring to find common ground.","The intense homesickness I've been experiencing has been incredibly stressful. My initial response was to cry and miss my family.

I learned a lot about quick thinking and formulating arguments, and it boosted my confidence.","I'm a pretty organized person, and I like to plan ahead.  When I decided I wanted to get a certain grade in a particular class, I mapped out a schedule for completing assignments and studying.  I set aside specific times for reading and homework, and used apps to help me stay on top of deadlines. This was a challenge because I'm used to having some flexibility, but the routine helped me achieve my goal. It was rewarding to see the results of my hard work, and I learned a lot about self-discipline.","I thrive in social situations, but college has presented a new challenge. While I am naturally outgoing, the large size and somewhat intimidating nature of college crowds left me feeling a bit drained and less energized than expected.  I'm used to smaller groups where I know everyone. The unapproachable demeanor of some students made it hard to connect and made my social interactions less fulfilling than usual.","I generally try to get along with people, but that doesn't mean I avoid disagreements.  I remember a conflict I had with a classmate over a group project.  Instead of getting angry, I tried to understand their perspective, and explained my own point of view calmly and respectfully. While we didn’t completely agree, we found common ground, and worked together to get the project done. My priority was to collaborate effectively, even if that meant compromising.","College has been a source of anxiety for me.  The sheer scale of everything, the new people, the fear of not fitting in – it all made me incredibly nervous.

I'm more likely to avoid conflict altogether, but if confronted with an opposing viewpoint, I'll politely attempt to find common ground or at least find a way to agree to disagree.  Maintaining harmony is a priority over forcefully expressing my disagreements.","When stressed, I tend to become withdrawn and quiet.

I use a planner to schedule my time and try to prioritize tasks, but I'm not always perfect.

I struggle with balancing social life and academics.","A recent Friday night spent at the gym with a friend was incredibly energizing. Unlike others who were out partying, we focused on our fitness. This experience showed me that I need balance; while I enjoy socializing, I also need periods of solitude and self-care to recharge.  My preference is to make time for both types of activities.","Disagreements happen; my strategy is to listen carefully and try to understand the other person's perspective before stating my own, even if there is strong emotion involved. For me, a respectful exchange is important, even when we don't see eye to eye. I think open communication is vital in resolving conflict.","Starting college has been stressful at times, especially being away from home.

The experience was unlike anything I'd ever encountered; the music felt magical and profoundly moving, opening up a new plane of consciousness.  It was the potential for transformative experiences that motivated me to go, and afterward I felt invigorated and inspired to continue seeking out such unique opportunities.","While I haven’t explicitly laid out a structured goal with specific timelines, my life is driven by a persistent desire to explore and experience as much as possible. I manage this by prioritizing experiences over rigid planning, allowing spontaneity and prioritizing intense, transformative encounters.

The rewarding aspect is the constant discovery and growth; the challenge lies in avoiding self-destruction and balancing risk with responsibility.","My social experiences are largely self-selected;  I gravitate towards smaller, more intimate interactions with like-minded individuals who appreciate the same depth and intensity of experience. Large, superficial gatherings tend to leave me feeling drained. My preference is for quality over quantity when it comes to connection.","I don't often find myself in direct disagreements with others.  My focus is generally on personal growth and pushing boundaries rather than engaging in direct conflict. If disagreement does arise, I tend to prioritize understanding the other person's perspective; though I might not alter my actions to suit others, I respect their right to their own view.","While the essay touches on the ever-present challenge of avoiding self-destruction, I don’t experience debilitating anxiety.

I'm not sure I'd call myself artistically inclined, but I'm certainly open to exploring new passions.","I'm a fairly organized person, especially when it comes to fulfilling my commitments.  Sending Edwin those pictures from our trip to San Antonio was a priority for me, so I made sure to set aside time to do that and handle the mailing. I am also very committed to keeping up with my online posts, though sometimes other things like catching up on emails and other commitments make it difficult.  Meeting deadlines, even small ones like this essay prompt, keeps me feeling on track and accomplished.","While I value my close relationships and cherish the time I spend with people like Edwin and Jon, large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I prefer deeper connections with a smaller number of people.  The joy I found in my reconnection with Edwin, after ten years, was deeply fulfilling because of the intimacy and shared history, which is what I truly appreciate in social interactions.","I strive to be understanding and avoid conflict, but sometimes it's unavoidable.  The essay shows my frustration with the endless questions in the newsgroup, but rather than confront those individuals directly, I chose to manage the situation by minimizing my participation.  Maintaining my peace of mind and avoiding unnecessary arguments are important to me.","I generally have a calm demeanor, but sometimes stress does creep in. This happened after the experience of meeting Edwin again. Feeling stressed about meeting deadlines can easily happen. I usually manage it by focusing on the task at hand, like this essay, and reminding myself of my goals which brings me some peace.  Finding healthy ways to release tension is important to me; writing and the prospect of my mom's cooking have been helpful outlets.",y,y,n,y,n

Looking back, it was definitely a positive experience.","Honestly, time management hasn't been my strong suit.  My goal of getting good grades in college has been a bit of a struggle;  I haven’t developed any specific strategies yet, and  procrastination is a recurring problem.  The freedom of college life, while appealing, has made it harder to maintain a strict study schedule.  Learning to prioritize and manage my time effectively is a work in progress.  The rewarding part is the sense of accomplishment when I do manage to stay on track, although that is rare.","I find large social gatherings draining. The first week of college, being surrounded by strangers and feeling isolated, left me pretty depleted. It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  I'm learning to balance my need for quiet time with the desire to connect with others.

While my initial response might be to avoid direct confrontation, I recognize the importance of voicing my concerns and working toward a mutually acceptable outcome. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, but it's sometimes challenging for me to stand my ground in a disagreement.","The transition to college life was a significant source of stress and anxiety.  Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the independence and responsibility, leading to some anxious moments. To cope, I relied on talking to new friends I'd made, finding some small comforts in things like familiar foods, and using exercise as a stress reliever.

1300,"I don't really think about trying new things.  Winning the football game was great, but it wasn't exactly a ""new"" experience.  I'm pretty comfortable with what I know and what I like. I guess school is new, but it's mostly just more of the same.","I don't really plan things out that much. I mean, I'm in school, and I show up to football practice, but I'm not big on setting long-term goals.  The football season was a goal, but even then, we didn't really plan strategies.  I prefer to just go with the flow and see what happens.","Winning the football game was a really energizing social experience.  Being part of a team and celebrating a win with my teammates is really great; it's fulfilling to share that with people.  I feel drained when I'm around people who don't put in effort, like some of my high school teammates did when our team started losing.","I don't really like conflict.  I mean, I’m not the type to cause it, but I don't really worry too much about resolving it if it arises. If someone is bothering me, I mostly just avoid them.  It's not worth the effort to get into a fight.","I get pretty stressed when things don't go my way, like when my high school team lost, or when Texas lost the football game.  I usually just get frustrated.  I don't really have strategies for dealing with it; I kind of just let it happen until it passes. Then I just get back to what I was doing.",n,n,n,n,n
