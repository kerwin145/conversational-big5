1301,"I’m not really one for trying new things; I prefer the familiar and comfortable.  The essay doesn't show many examples of trying something new. I value my individuality, but that doesn't mean I’m always seeking out novel experiences.","I'm pretty organized and focused on my goals.  For example, I mentioned needing to read for my theater class tomorrow, showcasing a level of planning. While I don't explicitly detail my strategies,  the essay implies a degree of planning and prioritizing responsibilities.","I enjoy social interactions, as evidenced by my concern about others passing out near me and my desire to call Jessie. I am energized by positive social experiences with people I care about, like the girl who helped me when I fainted. Negative interactions or large social gatherings aren't something I specifically addressed.","I believe in being considerate of others' feelings;  I was bothered by someone saying something hurtful to another person, suggesting empathy and a desire for respectful communication. I believe in knowing the whole story before judging someone.","While I get anxious—the essay notes stress about my computer and upcoming class—I don't dwell on it. I handle stress by focusing on my priorities, like reading for class and managing my appearance (the comments on scratches). My responses to stress aren't intensely emotional or prolonged.",n,y,y,y,n
1302,"I’m always looking for new experiences.  Taking a psychology class was completely outside my usual realm, and while initially daunting, the insights I'm gaining about myself are surprisingly helpful.  I’m motivated by self-improvement and the potential to understand myself better.  So far, it's been a positive experience.","Getting into architecture school is my biggest goal, and it requires intense focus and hard work. I manage my time by prioritizing and creating study schedules, while using the support of my friends and professors to stay on track.  The challenge is balancing the immense pressure with my social life, but knowing how much it means to my parents keeps me motivated.  The rewarding aspect is seeing my progress and the possibility of a future career in architecture.","Meeting new people can be draining, especially if it involves small talk or forced interactions.  However,  when I'm with good friends, like my roommate, I feel energized.  The difference is genuine connection rather than superficial interactions. It's reinforced my need for meaningful relationships over large, superficial social circles.","I avoid direct conflict, but sometimes find myself disagreeing with someone.  Rather than confrontation, I try to understand their perspective, sometimes by listening to their viewpoint first.  My priority is finding common ground and maintaining a positive relationship.  Sometimes, it might require compromising but I try to do so in a way that feels respectful to all sides.","The pressure of getting into architecture school causes me significant stress and anxiety, which sometimes leads to late nights filled with worry.  I cope by studying hard, keeping myself busy, and using my positive outlook to focus on my goals.  Talking to my close friends helps, reminding me to stay focused on my goals and to prioritize my personal well-being.",y,y,y,n,n
1303,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to radically new experiences; I prefer things that are familiar and comfortable.  However, learning to slalom ski was definitely outside my comfort zone. I was motivated by the challenge and the fun of being out on the lake with friends.  Though I ended up with a broken nose and other injuries, it was an ultimately rewarding experience, proving to myself that I could tackle something difficult.","Setting and achieving the goal of learning to slalom ski demonstrates my conscientious nature.  I dedicated two days to the task, even though it resulted in some painful setbacks. My strategies were simply persistent practice and a refusal to give up easily. The challenging aspect was the physical pain, but the rewarding part was the sense of accomplishment, and mastery.","The social experience at Lake Georgetown was mixed. While I enjoyed the company of my friends, the arguments between Crystal and Carl, and later the need to mediate, were draining. I prefer calm and harmonious interactions, and conflict requires a lot of energy from me, highlighting my introverted nature.  The experience reinforced my preference for smaller, close-knit groups of people with whom I share a strong bond.","The conflict between Crystal and Carl required me to act as a mediator. My priority was to help them understand each other and improve their communication.  I approached the situation calmly, listened to both sides without judgment, and focused on facilitating a resolution.  Maintaining positive relationships and harmony is extremely important to me, so finding a common ground for them was my main focus.","The weekend of slalom skiing left me with multiple injuries and some significant physical discomfort. My initial response was pain, and fatigue. The next day I was unable to even get out of bed, but I focused on the positive aspects of the overall experience and my ability to get better and I was able to return to my daily routine after a period of rest and recovery. I focused on taking it easy and allowed myself to heal.",n,y,n,y,n
1304,"I haven't really tried anything radically new lately.  My life feels pretty routine.  I enjoy familiar things like watching ""Friends"" and taking walks in nature.  New experiences often seem more trouble than they're worth, and I tend to stick to what I know.","I'm aiming to do well in my premed and business classes, which requires consistent studying and time management. I create schedules, but I don't always stick to them perfectly.  Procrastination is a weakness, and even though I get frustrated with myself, I don’t typically use specific strategies.  The challenge is balancing coursework with social time and my desire to simply relax, which is often rewarding in itself.","Most social interactions drain me.  Even lunch with my suite mate, while pleasant enough, left me feeling tired afterwards.  I prefer smaller groups, and I find one-on-one interactions even more challenging. I guess I'm more introverted than I'd realized; I value alone time and find large social gatherings overwhelming.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid conflict and often just agree to avoid upsetting people, even if I disagree internally. While it may seem agreeable on the surface, it's more about wanting to avoid unpleasantness than a genuine desire for harmony. My priority is maintaining a calm and peaceful environment, even if it means compromising my own opinion.","I get stressed easily. The pressure of pre-med and the uncertainty about the future cause anxiety. My initial response is often worry and self-doubt. To cope, I usually take walks, watch TV, or just try to distract myself.  It's not a very proactive approach, but it helps momentarily.",n,y,n,n,y
1305,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  My focus has been on my relationship and adjusting to college life in Austin, which feels pretty overwhelming.  I guess dyeing my hair five times trying to get the right color was a bit adventurous, but mostly I'm sticking to what's familiar and comfortable.","I’m definitely not the most organized person.  My goal of finishing my readings and homework is constantly thwarted by distractions like TV. I’ll start with good intentions, but I often end up watching a movie instead. I know I need to develop better study habits, but I struggle with procrastination.","Being with my boyfriend is energizing for me; he's my safe space.  Other social situations, like making friends in college, leave me feeling drained.  I tend to avoid large groups and prefer close, intimate relationships. I think I’m probably more introverted than I realize.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually keep my opinions to myself or try to find common ground.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if that means compromising my own views.  The essay shows I am close to my sister and don’t fight with her which highlights this agreeableness.","I get stressed easily.  School, my relationship, and adjusting to a new city are all contributing factors. My initial response to stress is often avoidance; I'll put things off, watch TV, or eat too much.  Writing this essay has been a bit therapeutic, though, and helps me process my feelings.",n,n,n,n,y
1306,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they make me a little anxious.  For instance,  starting this essay felt completely alien, yet I plunged in, focusing on my immediate sensory experiences rather than planning it out.  Afterwards, I felt a strange mix of relief and exhaustion, but also a sense of accomplishment at confronting something unfamiliar.  This whole exercise felt oddly liberating.","I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning. I did set a goal of finishing this essay, though, and I surprised myself by sticking to the time limit despite distractions and physical discomfort.  My main strategy was simply pushing through the discomfort and ignoring my inclination to procrastinate.  While rewarding in the sense of completing the task, the physical strain and lack of planning were definitely challenging.","Social interactions tend to drain me. The phone call was a perfect example; the interruption broke my concentration and even the answering machine message added to the anxiety. I prefer solitude and quiet contemplation—and I suspect that reflects a strong introverted nature, though I’m not entirely sure.","I generally avoid conflict. While I might have opinions, I rarely voice them aggressively. I tend to internalize disagreements and find strategies to avoid direct confrontation, preferring to focus on my own thoughts and feelings rather than resolve the issue externally.","This essay writing exercise was intensely stressful. The itching, the noise, the pressure to produce something coherent — it all triggered a surge of anxiety. Initially, I tried to ignore it,  but then I channeled that anxiety into the writing itself, observing and noting every physical sensation. It was a strange way to cope, but it worked.",y,y,n,n,y
1307,"I’m not one for drastically new experiences, preferring familiarity and things I already know I enjoy.  However, moving to Texas for school was a step outside my comfort zone. While initially apprehensive, the positive experience of meeting diverse people and enjoying my classes has been a pleasant surprise, expanding my horizons in a way I didn't expect.  The diversity of the student body, something I initially viewed with some trepidation, is now something I actively appreciate.","I wouldn't say I'm particularly organized or driven when it comes to long-term goals. I didn't have a rigid plan to manage my time for this move, relying more on adapting as I go.  While I might not meticulously plan each step,  the positive reception to my arrival in Texas and my enjoyment of my classes have acted as intrinsic motivation to keep me engaged in my studies.  The rewarding aspect is simply the ease and enjoyment of my new surroundings, which makes sticking to my studies effortless, in a sense.",Attending the Dave Matthews Band concert in Houston was incredibly energizing. Being surrounded by people who shared my enthusiasm for the music created a positive and uplifting atmosphere. The shared experience of enjoying the music and the band's performance fueled my energy and left me feeling connected and invigorated.  It confirmed my preference for social situations that revolve around shared interests and positive emotional connections.,"I haven't had many significant disagreements since moving to Texas. My focus is on enjoying my classes and the new environment. I would describe myself as being pretty easy-going when it comes to handling any slight disagreements, avoiding conflict rather than actively pursuing resolution, unless something directly impacts my personal enjoyment or well-being.","I wasn't particularly stressed or anxious about moving to Texas, even though I had initial reservations.  My approach was more of a relaxed acceptance of the potential difficulties, trusting that things would work out. If anything, the surprising ease of transition and the enjoyment of my new life here has been the dominant emotion,  affirming that my relatively low levels of anxiety and stress are accurate.",n,n,y,n,n
1308,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven to try new things.  My experiences tend to be more focused on familiar comforts. For example, I stick to foods I know I like, and I’m not one for traveling to unfamiliar places.  I’m perfectly content with my routines, although sometimes I do wish I was more open to different perspectives.","I don't really set long-term goals; I tend to go with the flow more than anything else.  If I need to complete a task, I'll usually get it done eventually, but I don't meticulously plan or prioritize. Time management isn't really my strong suit. I find it challenging to stay focused and often get distracted by random thoughts.","Social interactions tend to drain my energy. I prefer spending time alone or with a select few close friends rather than large groups. Energetic, boisterous social gatherings leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. I value quiet time to recharge.  I avoid large gatherings unless absolutely necessary.","I generally try to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I tend to accommodate the other person's perspective to maintain harmony, even if I don't entirely agree.  Maintaining peaceful relationships is more important to me than necessarily winning an argument. My priorities are focused on the comfort of those around me and myself.","I tend to overthink things and worry excessively, especially about inconsequential things.  When feeling stressed, my initial response is often to retreat and dwell on my anxieties.  Managing these feelings is difficult, and I don’t have specific strategies I utilize to constructively tackle those feelings.",n,n,n,y,y
1309,"I haven't really tried anything *completely* new lately,  mostly because I'm overwhelmed with getting settled and organized in this new place.  However, going to Barnes & Noble to study with Amy might count; it's a different study environment than my distracting room. I'm hoping it'll be a positive experience and help me focus.","My biggest goal right now is getting organized—unpacking, decorating, and managing my schoolwork. It's been challenging to stay on track because of procrastination and distractions.  I've tried making lists of daily, weekly, and monthly goals, but I often find myself getting sidetracked.  The reward will be a much more comfortable and functional living space, and the reduced stress from being more organized.","A recent social experience that energized me was going out with my friends.  Being around people I enjoy being around and sharing fun experiences is really uplifting. The draining experiences often involve large social gatherings that involve people I don't know well, especially situations with frat guys I find superficial and judgmental. This has reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings with close friends.","I’ve had disagreements with my roommate about noise levels—the incessant beeping of the smoke detector drives me crazy, while she seems unaffected. I’ve tried to communicate my concerns calmly, prioritizing finding a solution that works for both of us, such as getting new batteries for the smoke detector. Ideally, we can find a middle ground to ensure we are both comfortable.","I get really stressed when things feel chaotic and disorganized, like right now with unpacking and managing all my responsibilities.  Initially, I tend to procrastinate and avoid tackling the issues. To cope, I try to break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps and find a quiet place to study, like Barnes & Noble. This helps me to feel less overwhelmed and gain a sense of accomplishment.",n,n,y,y,n
1310,"I recently decided to try learning advanced calculus, something completely outside my usual business coursework.  I was motivated by a growing fascination with the logical structure and problem-solving aspects of mathematics.  The experience has been challenging but ultimately rewarding, confirming my interest in a potential career change.","Balancing schoolwork, my social life, and my passion for hockey has demanded significant organization.  I use a planner and regularly review my assignments to allocate time efficiently. While I've occasionally fallen behind, these setbacks have highlighted the importance of consistent effort and proactive planning.  The rewarding aspect is seeing my progress in both academics and athletics.","Large social gatherings tend to leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends, where genuine connections can be formed.  This realization has led me to value quality over quantity when it comes to social engagements, prioritizing deeper relationships.","When disagreements arise, I prioritize respectful communication and understanding the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree. My goal is to find common ground and reach a resolution that is mutually acceptable. I believe in compromise and actively seek to understand different viewpoints.","My stress levels have been quite high lately, primarily due to the academic pressures of college and personal uncertainties. Initially, I react with anxiety, but I channel this energy into hockey, which serves as a healthy outlet.  I recognize the importance of prioritizing self-care and seeking support when needed to manage my emotions constructively.",y,y,n,y,n
1311,"I’m always up for trying new things, even if it's just a new coffee shop. I tend to be spontaneous and enjoy exploring new ideas and experiences, even if they're a bit out of my comfort zone. For example, last semester I decided to take a pottery class on a whim. It was challenging but also very rewarding and helped me develop a new skill. I’m always looking for new and different things, but I don't always follow through with them.","I'm fairly organized and goal-oriented. Although I sometimes struggle with procrastination, I generally manage to stay on top of my responsibilities. A recent goal was to improve my fitness. I’ve been working hard at going to the gym more regularly even though I haven’t been able to keep up with it as I want. I sometimes struggle with staying motivated when life gets busy, but I usually manage to push through. The rewards are definitely worth the struggle.","I enjoy social interaction, but I’m also very comfortable spending time alone. I tend to be more introverted than extraverted overall. Large, loud social gatherings can be draining; I often find myself seeking out quieter, more intimate settings. A few weeks ago I went to a party and found myself feeling exhausted afterwards, while a small dinner with close friends was far more revitalizing. I’m learning that quality time with a few friends is better for me than a large group outing.","I am generally pretty agreeable. However, when I strongly disagree with someone, I try to express my opinion clearly and respectfully, while prioritizing maintaining a positive relationship.  My main priority is always to ensure open communication and understanding and that there is mutual respect throughout the conflict. For example, there was a disagreement with my roommate about cleaning but we eventually came to an understanding through a calm discussion.","I can be prone to anxiety and stress. I get overwhelmed easily, especially if my schedule is too demanding. I get tense pretty easily. If I am stressed, I usually take steps to manage my emotions. I try to address these issues by identifying the stressors, working towards solutions, and using relaxation techniques. It is very important for me to take care of myself, both mentally and physically, and to avoid overworking myself.",y,y,y,n,y
1312,"My trip to Nepal was a profound experience in openness.  Hiking for a month in the Himalayas, far from my usual fast-paced life, pushed me completely outside my comfort zone.  The motivation stemmed from a deep desire for solitude and self-discovery, a yearning to escape the constant stimulation of modern life and reconnect with nature's simplicity. Afterward, I felt a sense of expansive freedom and clarity, a newfound appreciation for the beauty and power of the natural world and a deepened sense of self.","While my Nepal trip was spontaneous in some ways, the planning leading up to it was quite meticulous. I researched extensively, secured necessary permits and vaccinations, meticulously packed my gear, and budgeted carefully.  Once there, my daily routines involved consistent self-care, mindful engagement with activities and adapting to unpredictable situations while sticking to my goals of completing the trek. This required flexibility and attention to detail, but the reward was an exceptional journey despite unforeseen challenges.","The crowded classroom at UT initially felt overwhelming, a stark contrast to the solitude of the mountains. However, the quiet moments of meditation during the trip allowed me to return to the campus and appreciate the energy of the bustling environment and social interactions, even with 50,000 people. My social interactions during my trip, particularly with Ramesh and the Nepali men, were deeply fulfilling; they showed me the power of human connection across language and cultural barriers.","The challenges on the trip involved interactions with many people; some westerners' frustrations with delays were a source of conflict. However, I prioritized maintaining calm and empathy, understanding that everyone was dealing with the stress of travel delays. My focus was on finding solutions and demonstrating compassion, rather than engaging in unproductive arguments. It’s part of my nature to foster harmony and understanding.","The unpredictability of travel in Nepal, the monsoon rains, and delays in transportation all significantly challenged my sense of control. Initially, I felt anxious, but I focused on the present, and practicing Buddhist meditation was crucial.  My response was to remain calm, flexible, and focus on my ability to adapt. I accepted things as they unfolded.  The overall experience taught me the value of resilience and adapting to change.",y,y,y,y,y
1313,"I recently decided to try rock climbing, something completely outside my usual comfort zone.  The motivation was a desire to challenge myself physically and mentally, and to experience something new and exciting. While I was initially terrified, the feeling of accomplishment after conquering a challenging route was incredibly rewarding, and I'm eager to continue.","I haven't been the best at setting and sticking to long-term goals in the past.  I tend to get overwhelmed and sidetracked easily, and often struggle to prioritize tasks effectively.  I'm trying to improve, but it's a work in progress. My current approach involves breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable steps, but it still requires significant effort and focus.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I already know well.  The energy required to participate fully in loud, crowded events can be exhausting, making me value quiet time and reflective solitude afterward.","I find disagreements challenging and try to avoid direct confrontation whenever possible.  My priority in resolving conflict is to maintain a peaceful environment.  I am not afraid to express my opinion, but I also value mutual respect and understanding.","Starting university has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.  My initial response is to feel overwhelmed and a bit panicked. I've found that talking to friends and family, engaging in physical activity, and allowing myself some downtime are helpful strategies for managing my feelings.",y,n,n,n,y
1314,"I'm not exactly someone who seeks out new experiences for the thrill of it.  My comfort zone is pretty well-defined. However, my friend pushed me to open up, and that was a new experience in its own way, leading to a surprising sense of relief and a deeper connection with her. That said, I still prefer the familiar.","I'm not always the most organized person, but when it comes to the people I care about, I’m incredibly dedicated.  My focus is intensely on maintaining those relationships, even when life throws curveballs.  I prioritize maintaining contact and offering support, even if I have to juggle other responsibilities, demonstrating my commitment.  It can be exhausting, but it’s entirely rewarding to know that I’m there for them.","I find large social gatherings draining.  The noise and the constant interaction leave me feeling overwhelmed.  I recharge best in smaller, more intimate settings with close friends, like my one true friend.  The interactions are less demanding and allow for deeper connections, which really energize me.  Being with her helps me feel understood.","Disagreements are difficult for me; I tend to internalize conflict rather than directly confronting it.  Prioritizing harmony and avoiding confrontation is my go-to, even if it means compromising my own needs.  Sometimes this leads to resentment, but I'd rather keep the peace.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard. I tend to withdraw into myself when feeling overwhelmed, leading to overthinking and negativity. My emotions often feel intense and uncontrollable. Finding ways to soothe myself, like talking to my close friend, and managing my thoughts is key to regaining my composure.",n,y,y,n,y
1315,"While I wouldn't say I'm a thrill-seeker, I do enjoy delving into subjects that initially seem daunting. For example, tackling the complexities of the kinetic theory of matter in my essay was a challenge I embraced.  The motivation stemmed from a desire to understand a fundamental concept, and the satisfaction of mastering it was incredibly rewarding. The process felt like solving a puzzle, which I found inherently engaging.","I'm not one for strict schedules; my approach tends to be more spontaneous.  My essay's detailed experimental procedure, however, showcases a surprising level of methodical approach.  The need for accurate data recording forced a degree of conscientiousness—the fear of flawed results was my driving force, and the sense of accomplishment following the experiment's completion was immensely satisfying, even if my overall approach to life may lack typical conscientiousness.","Large social gatherings generally leave me feeling depleted rather than energized. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can engage in deeper, less superficial conversations. For instance, discussing scientific concepts with a colleague would likely invigorate me, whereas a large party would drain my energy.  This has taught me the importance of choosing my social engagements carefully and recognizing my introverted nature.","I'm generally willing to entertain different perspectives, even if I disagree. During group projects, even if I have a different approach, I would prioritize finding a collaborative solution that incorporates everyone's ideas.  Rather than forcing my opinion, I value a compromise that allows everyone to feel heard and respected, even if the final product might not perfectly match my initial vision.","I am prone to anxiety, especially when facing unfamiliar or challenging tasks. The thought of conducting the experiment and potentially failing or obtaining inaccurate data caused considerable stress. But I found that meticulously planning every step and breaking down the experiment into manageable chunks helped alleviate my worries. It’s about managing that anxiety, not eliminating it entirely.",y,n,n,y,y
1316,"Restarting figure skating after a long break was a completely new experience for me, not because of the activity itself, but because of the context.  Returning to the rink felt like reclaiming a significant part of my identity that had been dormant. The motivation stemmed from a deep-seated passion for the sport and a desire to regain a sense of self and refuge, and it was incredibly rewarding to rediscover that.","Balancing my desire to fully embrace college life with the need to maintain academic success presented a significant challenge. While I signed up for additional dance and skating classes – actions driven by personal passion – I didn't explicitly outline a detailed plan to manage my time. My approach was more spontaneous, focusing on enjoying the present moment and trusting my ability to adapt as needed.  The rewarding aspect was the excitement of trying new things, and the challenge was to maintain a balance, something I’m still figuring out.","Meeting Kristen and Claire at the ice skating rink was a very energizing social experience.  Their kindness, in offering rides, created a supportive and welcoming atmosphere that contrasted sharply with the occasional social anxiety I feel.  This interaction reinforced my preference for genuine connections over large, overwhelming social gatherings.  It showed me the power of small, meaningful interactions in fostering a sense of belonging.","My conflict with Judy stemmed from her judgmental and self-righteous behavior, which I found hurtful and disrespectful.  My priority was to express my feelings clearly and directly, though not necessarily immediately. I value open communication but I am not afraid of setting boundaries and prioritizing my own well-being; avoiding direct interaction for a while is part of that. It's more about protecting myself from negativity than avoiding conflict entirely.","While I generally maintain a positive outlook, my anger towards Judy highlights a vulnerability to feelings of hurt and frustration. My initial response was anger, which was surprisingly strong given my usual temperament.  My coping mechanism involved distancing myself to prevent further escalation. While it's not a proactive strategy, it’s effective for me in the short term, offering emotional protection until I can process the situation calmly.",y,n,n,y,n
1317,"I'm not exactly one for trying new things.  Most of my time is spent online, which is familiar and comfortable.  The only new thing I can think of was watching *Survivor*; it was okay, I guess, a temporary distraction from the usual routine.  Mostly I prefer things that I already know I enjoy.",I don't exactly excel at long-term goals.  My approach to studying is pretty reactive – I cram before quizzes and tests.  Time management isn't really my strong suit; procrastination is more my style. The challenge is definitely staying motivated; the reward is avoiding failing grades.,"Social interactions generally drain me.  I much prefer the company of my computer to people. The essay itself is a testament to my introverted nature.  Meaningful connections require effort, and honestly, that effort feels like too much work.","Disagreements are avoided whenever possible. If confronted, I likely keep to myself or avoid the conflict. My priorities are in maintaining peace for myself, not necessarily engaging in conflict resolution or understanding the other person's point of view.","Stress and anxiety are familiar feelings. My initial response is usually avoidance; I distract myself, often with the internet.  Ultimately, I muddle through, but constructive coping mechanisms aren't really part of my repertoire.",y,n,n,n,y
1318,"I decided to try out for the novice rowing team, something completely outside my comfort zone.  What motivated me was the challenge—pushing myself physically and proving to myself I could do it. While the early morning workouts are brutal, I find the whole experience exciting. The feeling of accomplishment and camaraderie will be worth it if I make the team.","Making the rowing team requires immense dedication. I maintain a strict workout schedule, prioritizing training even when other things come up.  To stay organized, I use planners and set daily goals. While balancing school, work, and rowing is challenging, the payoff of reaching my fitness goals makes the effort worthwhile.","Going to get my meningitis shot with Liz was energizing.  It felt good to hang out with someone supportive and friendly.  Conversely, dealing with Julie when she seemed to be upset with me drained me; I prefer interacting with people who are generally positive and easygoing.","I had a disagreement with my roommate about her snoring. I expressed my feelings calmly and honestly, prioritizing finding a compromise so we can coexist peacefully. We worked out a system of earplugs which resolved the issue, and it strengthened our friendship.","The pressure of getting into UT and maintaining a high GPA, coupled with the demands of my rowing training, produces a lot of stress and anxiety. I deal with this through exercise and focusing on my goals— reminding myself that I can handle the pressure, and that the stress is temporary.  If I focus on the present and what I can control, I feel less overwhelmed.",y,y,y,n,y
1319,"Trying something new isn't really my thing.  I've never been one for big adventures or radically different experiences.  The thought of it makes me a bit anxious, actually. I’d rather stick with what I know and what's comfortable. That said, watching *ER* last night was kinda new for me—I don't usually watch hospital dramas, but it sparked my imagination of becoming an ER doctor.","I'm not the most organized person.  I tend to get overwhelmed when I have a big goal. If I have to manage my time and resources carefully for anything, it often doesn't go as planned. It's more about spurts of intense effort than sustained, consistent work. Though if I’m truly invested in something,  like becoming a doctor, I'll usually find a way to get it done, even if it takes a while.","Large social gatherings totally drain me.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well, like my brother Eric. Spending time with a big group of people is overwhelming and stressful, leaving me irritable. I get much more energy from quiet time to myself or from spending time with one or two close friends.","Disagreements are uncomfortable.  I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. If a conflict does arise, my priority is resolving the situation as quickly and smoothly as possible, even if it means compromising on some of my own views or preferences. I also tend to avoid confronting people directly, as seen in the essay where I subtly comment on someone's behavior, instead of directly calling them out.","I get stressed easily. Little things like a slow computer or a persistent wrong number can send my anxiety through the roof.  My initial response is usually irritation and frustration. To manage it, I try to remove myself from the stressful situation, like turning off the TV. I usually don't proactively manage my emotions, but rather just wait for the feeling to pass.",y,y,y,n,n
1320,"I'm always open to new experiences.  Taking astronomy, philosophy, and being in the Longhorn Marching Band are all examples of that.  The sheer variety of subjects and activities excites me; it helps me see the world from different perspectives, which I find enriching. The feeling afterward is always one of intellectual stimulation and a sense of personal growth.","While I’m in the marching band, my time management could be better.  Juggling school and band is a challenge but I try to create a schedule and stick to it.  There are times I’m less effective, but I keep trying to improve my organization and focus.  What I find rewarding is that feeling of accomplishment of doing well in band and succeeding in my classes.","Being in the marching band is definitely an energizing social experience.  The camaraderie and shared activity create a positive and uplifting environment.  I appreciate the community, it’s fulfilling. However, sometimes the sheer intensity of the social interaction can be draining, and it’s helpful to have some alone time to recharge and reflect.","I haven't encountered any major disagreements so far, but I believe in open communication and understanding. I'd strive to actively listen to the other person's perspective and try to find common ground, prioritizing mutual respect and resolving conflict through discussion.  Even if we don’t agree, I value maintaining a civil relationship.","I find moments of stress when balancing academics and band practice. I usually respond by taking a deep breath, prioritizing my tasks, and maybe having a quiet moment alone. This helps me manage the situation constructively and maintain a level head. While I believe in the beauty of chaos, excessive stress is not something I enjoy.",y,y,y,y,n
1321,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows my focus is on my familiar relationships and routine, and I haven't really described venturing outside of my comfort zone in any significant way.  College itself is new, but I'm already feeling overwhelmed by it, suggesting I'm not embracing change easily.","I struggle with staying organized and on track, as evidenced by my worries about falling behind in my classes and my lack of a regular study schedule. The essay highlights my difficulty in managing my time effectively and my procrastination, which has led to stress and anxiety.  I have goals (a high GPA), but my actions don't reflect consistent effort toward achieving them.","Social interactions drain me. The essay reveals my strong preference for close relationships with a small group of friends, as opposed to broader social engagement. The simple act of writing this essay feels like a chore, further reinforcing my introverted nature and aversion to prolonged social situations.  Spending time with people I cherish gives me energy but interacting extensively with large or unfamiliar groups leaves me exhausted.","I don't directly address conflict in the essay, but my focus on missing my friends and longing for their company suggests I value harmony and close connections.  While I don't describe confronting disagreements, my overall tone hints at a preference for avoiding conflict rather than engaging in direct confrontation. My homesickness reflects a need for supportive relationships.","I experience significant anxiety and stress related to college, my academic performance, and my social life.  My essay overflows with worries about grades, keeping up with assignments, maintaining relationships, and my weight.  These anxieties lead to negative self-talk, as seen in my concern about gaining weight and not being able to maintain a study schedule, indicating a predisposition towards worrying and experiencing negative emotions.",n,n,n,n,y
1322,"I don't actively seek out novel experiences;  my focus is usually on completing tasks and managing my commitments.  The essay reflects this; while I mention wanting a break, it's driven by stress rather than a desire for exploration.  Trying something entirely new isn't a high priority for me.","My essay reveals a high level of conscientiousness. I'm juggling multiple responsibilities—scholarship, website, tutoring—and I'm clearly concerned about meeting deadlines.  My strategies for staying on track likely involve detailed to-do lists and a relentless focus on completing tasks, though I am feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work. The rewarding aspect is successfully completing each task; the challenge is the sheer volume.","While I value social connection, the breakup with Adrian highlights my tendency to become overwhelmed by social interactions.  The essay suggests I need solitude to recharge; large social events are likely draining for me. I prefer deep, meaningful connections over large, superficial ones.  I'd rather spend time alone processing thoughts than participate in many social engagements.","I don't explicitly discuss conflict in the essay, but the overall tone suggests a tendency to internalize stress rather than confront others directly.  In disagreements, I might prioritize maintaining a peaceful façade, even if it means neglecting my own needs or opinions. I'm not one for confrontation.","The essay strongly reflects high neuroticism. My anxieties about school, work, and relationships dominate my thoughts. My initial response to stress is likely worry and internalizing feelings, as expressed throughout the essay. I wish for escape – sleep, vacation – suggesting my coping mechanisms may need work; perhaps I'm too focused on escape as opposed to dealing with the situation.",n,y,y,n,y
1323,"I'm drawn to exploring new ideas, even if it means straying from a traditional path.  The essay reveals my interest in various social sciences and math, even though I haven't chosen a major that directly relates to these interests. I find the exposure to diverse subjects stimulating and enjoy learning simply for the sake of knowledge. This desire to explore new ideas and broaden my awareness fuels my academic pursuits.","I haven't always been the most organized person; my essay mentions my procrastination and lack of a clear academic plan.  Balancing my relationship and other obligations proves challenging. While I create lists of tasks (like finding a job, cleaning my room), my focus frequently shifts to thoughts of my boyfriend, demonstrating a less-than-meticulous approach to planning and task management. My priorities, at this moment, seem centered on my emotional life, overshadowing other duties.","My essay clearly shows I value deep connections over large social groups.  The strong feelings I have for my boyfriend illustrate a preference for close, intimate relationships rather than a wide circle of acquaintances.  While I am independent and don't seek out constant social interaction, my description of the profound companionship I feel with him highlights the energy and fulfillment I derive from such deep connections. Group work and large social gatherings aren't my cup of tea.","I describe my relationship as having “never had a real fight,” suggesting a willingness to avoid conflict and maintain harmony.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean I always readily compromise or readily accommodate others' viewpoints.  My tendency to imitate my boyfriend's behavior might indicate a willingness to align myself with someone else, even if it comes at the expense of my own preferences. This also isn’t indicative of strong assertive or uncompromising tendencies.","The constant intrusion of thoughts about my boyfriend and the resulting procrastination highlight a susceptibility to worry and distraction.  The essay demonstrates an internal struggle between responsibilities and intense emotional preoccupation. While I haven't explicitly described overwhelming anxiety, the preoccupation suggests that my emotional state significantly impacts my focus and ability to manage my day-to-day tasks effectively.",y,n,y,n,n
1324,"I’m not one for trying new things, honestly.  I stick to what I know.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone is generally unsettling.  Even small changes can feel overwhelming, so I tend to avoid them altogether.","I struggle with long-term goals.  My time management skills are… lacking, to put it mildly.  I get easily distracted and often find myself procrastinating.  It takes a lot for me to stay on task.  The rewarding part is the rare sense of accomplishment when I actually finish something.","Social situations exhaust me.  Large gatherings or even just extended conversations with people I don't know well leave me drained and irritable. I find quiet time essential to recharge.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm close to.","Disagreements are difficult.  I tend to avoid confrontation, often prioritizing harmony over expressing my own opinions strongly.  I might try to find common ground or simply agree to disagree, even if I'm not entirely comfortable with the other person's perspective.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  I often overthink and worry excessively, leading to sleepless nights and a general sense of unease.  Sometimes I retreat, but I do try to find constructive ways to manage it—like this writing exercise.  It helps to get my thoughts out.",n,n,n,y,y
1325,"I haven't really sought out many brand new experiences lately. My life has been pretty focused on school and maintaining my friendships from high school.  While I haven't actively pushed myself outside my comfort zone, the move to Austin and college has been a fairly significant change in environment, even if it wasn't something I consciously decided to try.  Honestly, I've been pretty preoccupied with other things to really explore the new things available to me.","Balancing school, homework, and my social life has definitely required consistent effort. I usually prioritize my assignments based on deadlines, and generally stick to a schedule. However, I'll admit that some days, especially when I'm tired like today, I struggle to keep up.  But the reward of a good grade or a fun night out keeps me motivated.  Finding time for everything while maintaining a degree of spontaneity is something I'm still working on.","Most of my memorable social experiences lately involve hanging out with my high school friends in Austin. Those nights are usually energizing; being with familiar faces and having a good time makes me feel at ease. When I try to branch out and meet new people, I often feel a little drained, especially if they don't have a common ground of shared experiences. I'm perfectly happy with my current social circles, but I know I need to actively work at expanding those circles.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, like with my economics professor's teaching style, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself unless it significantly impacts my learning. My priority is maintaining a harmonious relationship, even if it means compromising my own preferences. I think that's largely why I haven't moved on from my high school girlfriend, even though I know things are complicated.","Lack of sleep really gets to me. This morning, I woke up feeling anxious and overwhelmed, just thinking about the day ahead. I usually combat this by forcing myself to get out of bed and get moving, even if it's just to walk outside. The fresh air and sunlight always helps.  Sometimes I'll put on some music or do something mindless that takes my mind off things.  I try to avoid letting my anxiety spiral.",n,y,n,y,n
1326,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to trying radically new things.  My focus tends to be on my established routines and goals, like getting into pharmacy school.  While I might occasionally deviate slightly from the plan (like trying a new study method), major departures from my usual way of doing things aren’t really my style. I prefer structure and predictability.","My essay shows that I’m highly organized and detail-oriented when it comes to managing my schedule and goals.  I meticulously plan my time, noting deadlines (like homework, tests, and appointments), and strategize about how to meet them—often starting early or finding study partners.  While I can get stressed by the pressure, I generally stay committed and find satisfaction in accomplishing tasks.","I find large social gatherings draining.  The essay reveals I'm quite introverted; my social interactions are largely focused on smaller groups of close friends or family.  Large events like football games seem overwhelming and stressful to me, making me avoid them if possible. My ideal social experience is intimate and involves a few close people.","Disagreements aren't something I readily seek out. The essay reflects that while I have opinions and concerns (like about my apartment management and UT Austin's policies), I don't necessarily voice them confrontationally.  My priority is usually to maintain peace and move on to other tasks.  I'd likely try to find common ground or quietly adapt to different perspectives rather than engage in direct conflict.","I tend to experience stress and anxiety when facing significant challenges, like the pressures of school, moving, and upcoming exams.  The essay highlights my concerns about various things. My initial response is often worry and planning for all contingencies—and while I'm quite organized, this worry can be overwhelming.  My coping strategy is making detailed plans and trying to stay on top of everything.",n,y,n,n,y
1327,"I'm fascinated by exploring new ideas and concepts, even if they challenge my existing beliefs.  Reading about different perspectives, like the experiences of autistic individuals in that essay, really sparks my curiosity.  I enjoy learning new words and expanding my vocabulary, something I find stimulating and enriching.","I tend to be more spontaneous and less focused on long-term planning. While I have aspirations, like establishing a scholarship someday, I don't always rigorously plan how to achieve them.  I'm more likely to be driven by immediate interests and exciting opportunities,  which sometimes leads to a less structured approach.","I definitely thrive in social situations; engaging in conversations with roommates, my kickboxing instructor, or even a cab driver energizes me.  Interesting personalities and lively discussions are truly fulfilling.  The essay reveals my enjoyment of shared laughter and playful banter with friends.","I generally try to be empathetic and understanding in disagreements.  While I can be passionate about my beliefs, as shown in my strong reaction to suicide in the essay, I try to approach conflict with compassion, even if it is expressed somewhat strongly. I value honesty and clear communication, even when it means expressing strong opinions.","I generally manage stress fairly well. Although the essay reflects some strong opinions and emotional reactions to certain topics, like suicide, I don't tend to dwell on negativity. I channel my energy into productive activities and positive interactions, which helps me to stay grounded and optimistic.",y,n,y,y,n
1328,"I guess trying college was pretty new.  It's different than what I'm used to, and I miss my old friends and my old life. I was motivated by the idea of independence and no rules, but it hasn't been exactly what I expected.  I'm not sure if I feel good or bad about it—it’s complicated.","Honestly, I haven't been the most on-top-of-things lately.  I don't have a good system for managing my time or resources, which is why I’m behind on this assignment.  I've never really been great at planning things long-term. I find it really challenging to stay committed to anything when I'm feeling down.","Going to concerts with my friends was always energizing.  Being around people who understand me and appreciate my humor is really important to me.  But lately, I haven't been enjoying social situations as much, as shown by the fact that my friend's cancellation made me really sad.","I generally avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet to avoid a confrontation, which is probably why the concert cancellation bothered me. This assignment is making me even less agreeable.  I don't like feeling sad and alone.",I get stressed out easily.  The concert cancellation sent me into a downward spiral. I just felt overwhelmed and sad.  I started by trying to distract myself but it just made me feel worse. I am not really sure what to do.,y,n,y,n,y

This stream-of-consciousness writing exercise was new, and while I found it kind of fun at first, it mostly made me aware of how tired I am and how many thoughts are racing through my head.  It wasn't exactly a thrilling adventure.","I definitely procrastinated on this assignment. I know I should have started earlier, and I feel bad about waiting until the last minute.  My time management isn't my strong suit, but I try to prioritize what absolutely needs to be done (like this!) and then I can relax.  Honestly, the reward is getting it done and getting to relax.","A memorable social experience? Going to dinner with my roommate would be exhausting today, but typically social events energize me.  Being with friends and my boyfriend is where I feel most myself. It's the feeling of connection and shared laughter that makes it so fulfilling; being alone when I'm tired feels quite draining.","Disagreements are tricky. I try to listen to the other person’s perspective and calmly explain my own. While I value my relationships, I also need to be honest about my feelings. I suppose my priority is finding a solution that respects everyone involved, even if that means compromising.","When I’m stressed or anxious, my first response is usually to feel overwhelmed and tired. I find that focusing on relaxing activities like watching a movie or taking a nap is helpful. It helps to calm my thoughts and gain a little perspective.  I know that stressing more about things usually doesn't make them better.",n,y,y,y,n
1330,"The Animal Farm campaign in my junior English class was a completely new experience.  Mrs. Johnson's unorthodox teaching methods, pushing us to create elaborate campaign materials, motivated me to participate despite my initial apprehension.  While chaotic, the experience was ultimately rewarding, showcasing the power of creative expression and collaborative work.  It opened my eyes to a different approach to learning and showed me the fun that could be had in an academic setting.","While I enjoy creative endeavors, sustained effort towards long-term goals isn't my forte.  My approach to assignments often involves a last-minute rush, even though I know this isn't ideal.  I'm better at short bursts of intense focus than consistently applied effort.  Mrs. Johnson's class assignments, while sometimes stressful, instilled in me the understanding that even under pressure, I can still deliver quality work, though I sometimes wish I had developed better long-term planning skills.","Large social gatherings drain me.  The concert experience I describe was enjoyable, but the idea of being in a mosh pit highlights my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions.  I enjoy connecting with a few close friends rather than large, energetic crowds.  This preference reflects my need for quieter, more meaningful interactions rather than highly stimulating social experiences.","Disagreements are usually avoided, not confronted. I tend to keep my negative opinions to myself rather than voicing my objections directly.  While I don't actively seek conflict, the underlying sarcasm in my writing shows how I passively express my criticisms, which perhaps isn't the most agreeable approach.  I'd prefer to avoid confrontation, even if it means silently harboring my discontent.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a need to escape my current situation. The concert I attended, albeit without a companion, served as a necessary outlet to alleviate stress.  I find that immersing myself in activities I enjoy is more helpful than structured coping mechanisms.  While this avoidance might not be the most constructive approach, it temporarily relieves the pressure.",y,n,n,n,y

While I had romantic notions beforehand, the reality of experiencing life in Italy, France, and Germany challenged those preconceptions.  The unexpected beauty of Germany, and the overall experience of navigating unfamiliar cultures and environments, expanded my perspective and broadened my understanding of the world.  It definitely sparked a desire for more such experiences.","Balancing my coursework and social life at UT requires consistent planning and effort. I prioritize tasks using a planner and to-do lists, and I break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps. While procrastination sometimes tempts me, I use rewards and accountability to stay committed.  The rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment that comes with completing goals, while the challenging aspect is balancing my desire for exploration and learning with the need for structured work.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. I prefer smaller, intimate settings with close friends. The one-on-one interactions or small group settings allow me to truly connect with people and feel energized from genuine conversation.  Larger events can feel overwhelming and superficial, emphasizing the importance of quality over quantity in my friendships.","Disagreements are handled through calm, rational discussion. My priority is understanding the other person’s perspective, even if I don't agree with it. I believe that open communication and respectful dialogue are crucial for conflict resolution and maintaining healthy relationships. Finding common ground and compromise are more important to me than ""winning"" an argument.",Feeling overwhelmed in college initially resulted in feelings of anxiety. My response was to organize my thoughts and develop a manageable plan of action. Talking to my friends and utilizing campus resources helped me immensely.  I try to manage stress through mindfulness and prioritizing self-care. I understand the importance of seeking support when needed.,n,y,n,y,n
1332,"I'm drawn to observing the details around me—the sounds of shoes, the beeping machine, even the color of the floor.  While I wouldn't necessarily call it a ""new"" experience,  the act of paying such close attention to these sensory details is something I often find myself doing. It's a way of exploring the world around me and discovering unexpected connections and patterns. Afterward, I feel a sense of quiet satisfaction from this detailed observation, although sometimes I do wish I could tune some things out.","I haven't explicitly set a major goal as defined as others may, but I am generally focused on the task at hand, like writing this essay.  While I don’t employ strict time management techniques, I tend to be naturally persistent in my focus until a task is complete. This essay writing, though, has been a bit different with the many distractions pulling my attention. The challenge is to balance this attention to detail with the task at hand; the reward is the detail and insights I gain.","Being around a lot of people can be both energizing and draining, depending on how much quiet time I have afterward. I feel energized by observing the wide variety of personalities and interactions, but the constant stream of stimulation can be tiring. This essay writing, for example, is a social experience through my observations, but one that also demands a certain degree of solitude to process my thoughts.  So, I suppose I need a balance.",I generally try to approach disagreements with curiosity. I focus on understanding the other person's perspective and finding common ground. I find more fulfillment in learning than in winning an argument.  Disagreements are valuable opportunities to learn something new. I prefer peaceful resolutions.,"The beeping sound is a source of stress—it's loud and repetitive and completely steals my attention. Initially, I become fixated, obsessing about it. My coping mechanism is to observe the other details around me, this kind of hyper-focus helps to distract from the intrusive noise and the stress it creates.  Eventually, I become more accepting of the unavoidable sounds in my surroundings.",y,y,y,y,n
1333,"I'm not one for radically new experiences. I prefer the familiar and comfortable. However, starting college at UT was a huge change, going from a small town to a massive university. While I wouldn't call it ""trying something new"" in the traditional sense, it pushed me out of my comfort zone and forced me to adapt to a new environment and social scene. It was overwhelming at first, but ultimately rewarding as I made new friends and discovered new aspects of myself.","Balancing college and quitting my job required significant time management.  I prioritized my classes, creating a schedule and sticking to it as much as possible.  Although I initially worried about managing without a job's income, I saw this as essential for my academic success.  The challenge was the abrupt shift in routine, but the reward of academic focus and the reduced stress from juggling both were well worth it.",I feel energized by social interactions with my new friends at UT.  The welcoming environment and opportunities for socializing have been great.  It's different than the small-town dynamics I was used to. It's invigorating to be in a place where everyone is starting fresh and building connections rather than being stuck in pre-existing social hierarchies. Meeting new people and making friends there has been a very fulfilling experience.,"I haven't had major disagreements yet, but I'm fairly agreeable by nature. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, and I believe that open communication and compromise are important in resolving conflicts. I'm sure conflicts will arise, but I would hope to approach them with a calm and understanding attitude, focusing on finding solutions that work for everyone involved.","The stress of starting college, coupled with the pressure to succeed and concerns about my future, caused some anxiety.

I felt energized and happy afterward.","I've been trying to stick to a regular yoga practice, but honestly, I've been slacking.  My time management is inconsistent; I tend to get sidetracked easily. While I set goals, like finishing a book or finding out about a retreat, following through consistently is a challenge.  My motivation fluctuates, but the rewarding aspects of yoga outweigh the difficulty of sticking to a schedule.","Going to that party where Donald Glaude was DJing was incredibly energizing at first. The music was amazing and the atmosphere was electric. However, it drained me afterward – maybe it was the late night or the energy of the crowd. It taught me to be more mindful of how social interactions affect my energy levels, and to balance intense outings with quieter downtime.","I haven't explicitly described a disagreement in the essay. However, I am a friendly and easy-going person. If I were to encounter disagreement, I would probably try to understand the other person's point of view before presenting my own, aiming for a compromise or resolution that works for everyone.","The essay reveals moments of stress, like worrying about deadlines and bills.

While I always looked forward to college, the reality of being in a new city, new environment, and surrounded by strangers was initially overwhelming.

The rewarding aspect is the prospect of making lasting friendships and achieving academic success.","A memorable social experience that left me drained was attending a large party. The sheer number of people and the competitive atmosphere felt overwhelming, not energizing as I had anticipated.

I’ll often start with good intentions, making schedules, but life gets in the way—loud neighbors, sleep deprivation, and general discontent— leading me to fall behind. Any attempts at organization usually fall apart.  The challenge is maintaining momentum; the reward, if I manage it, is the relief of not being behind.","Going to parties leaves me feeling drained.

I need a balance of social interaction and independent time.","I generally prioritize harmony and understanding in disagreements, often prioritizing others' feelings.  I approach conflicts by trying to see things from their perspective. However, I'm learning to assert my own needs more confidently, particularly as I strive for greater independence in college.","Getting sick alone in college triggered significant anxiety. My initial response was panic.  To manage it, I focused on structuring my day, reaching out to friends and family for support, and reminding myself that this challenge is temporary.

The essay highlights my desire for quiet time and avoidance of social interaction (the desire to go home and clean instead of interacting with others). The thought of engaging with others, even close friends, often feels more stressful than fulfilling.   I definitely prefer solitude.","I generally try to avoid conflict, as reflected in my essay’s somewhat apathetic tone and lack of strong opinions.  If I disagree with someone, I'm more likely to internalize it rather than confront them. This likely contributes to my overall feeling of being overwhelmed, as I don’t like confrontation.","I get stressed easily, which is heavily emphasized throughout the essay.  My internal dialogue reveals my tendency towards worry and self-criticism.   Overthinking and frustration are common reactions for me, which tend to lead to procrastination instead of productive action.

While I wasn't naturally gifted, the experience was surprisingly enjoyable; I found a strange sense of calm in the process, and I'm proud of the wonky vase I made.","I set a goal to finish reading a hefty novel I'd been putting off for months. To stay on track, I dedicated specific times each day to reading, even if it was only for fifteen minutes.  I found that breaking down the task into smaller, manageable chunks made it feel less overwhelming.  The reward was immense; finishing that book was a huge sense of accomplishment and the start of a new, consistent reading habit.","A large party left me feeling completely drained. The constant noise and need for small talk, while enjoyable for a time, was mentally exhausting.  This reinforced my preference for smaller gatherings with close friends, where genuine connection feels more possible.","I recently disagreed with a friend about a political issue. I tried to listen to their perspective empathetically, even though I found it difficult, which is important because despite my feelings otherwise, I try to find common ground, focusing on our shared values to avoid the debate becoming personal. Ultimately, we agreed to respectfully disagree.","When facing a particularly stressful deadline, I initially felt overwhelmed and anxious.

When I had to finish a big research paper, I broke it down into manageable chunks, setting daily deadlines for each section.  I used a planner and set reminders to ensure I stayed on track. The challenge was maintaining focus, especially when I felt overwhelmed, but sticking to my schedule gave me a sense of control.  It was rewarding to see the final product, knowing how much work I put into it.","Social situations tend to drain me.  For example, a large party where I felt forced to constantly engage in small talk left me completely exhausted.  I prefer deeper connections with a few close friends rather than superficial interactions with many people.  That experience confirmed my introverted nature. I need quiet time to recharge after any social engagement, even with close friends.","I value harmony but will speak up if I feel strongly about something. For example, I had a disagreement with a friend about how to plan a shared project. I calmly explained my perspective, actively listened to theirs, and we eventually compromised by integrating aspects of both plans.  My priority was maintaining our friendship while achieving a mutually satisfactory outcome.","When my roommate, Susan, disappeared, I was incredibly stressed and anxious. My initial reaction was panic, I felt overwhelmed and helpless.  To manage this, I made a list of things I needed to do: contact her friends, notify her family, and call the police.

I've planned workout times and try to stick to a balanced diet, though I do struggle with impulsive snacking.  Challenges include adjusting to a new environment and managing time between classes and exercise.  The reward is feeling healthier and more in control, which gives me a sense of accomplishment.","Large lectures drain my energy. The impersonal setting and the sheer number of people make me feel overwhelmed and anxious.  Smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends, like our recent hangout, are much more fulfilling. They remind me that, despite all the college chaos, I still have those familiar connections, which I value greatly.","I tend to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I often internalize my feelings rather than confronting the person directly.  My priority is to maintain harmony, even if it means compromising my own preferences.

I felt depressed and overwhelmed by the new environment and lack of my closest friends.

My focus has been on adjusting to this huge change – a new city, new people, a new university – and that's taken up most of my energy.  I did attend a class on birth control, which was outside of my comfort zone, mainly driven by a fear of pregnancy rather than a desire for exploration.  It was informative, but not exactly the thrilling new adventure I would normally associate with pushing my boundaries.","Successfully moving out and starting college required a lot of self-discipline.  I managed my time by prioritizing classes and assignments, even though my initial set up took longer than expected. I’m generally responsible, making sure I get my work done and attend classes.  The biggest challenge has been managing the emotional aspects of this transition, which required a different approach than I am accustomed to; the rewarding part is that I'm managing it and slowly adjusting.","Most of my social interactions lately have left me feeling drained. The sheer size of the university and the constant stream of new faces is overwhelming.  Even connecting with my high school friends is difficult; the distance and the changes in our lives make it feel less close and easy than it used to. This experience has reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social circles.","I haven't had any major disagreements, but I have noticed some differences in opinions, particularly when discussing birth control with friends. I have a tendency to get quite concerned with others’ well-being, even if it isn't asked of me. It is challenging to not worry about them.  I prioritize safety and caution, which can lead to discussions that might not be welcomed; and the concern for others is probably what I feel is most important.","Moving away from home and starting college has been incredibly stressful.  Getting my laptop connected and the general adjustment to my new surroundings really hit me hard. I experienced physical illness and have been dealing with this wave of anxiety.

I used planners and to-do lists to manage my time, prioritizing tasks and breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable steps. While procrastination was a challenge, the satisfaction of completing goals and improving my knowledge kept me motivated.  The rewarding aspect outweighed the difficulties.","A memorable social experience was attending a philosophy club meeting.  The intellectual discussions and shared interest energized me, fostering a sense of community.  This reinforced my preference for stimulating conversations with like-minded individuals, highlighting the need for meaningful connection, not just superficial interactions.","In a disagreement with a friend over political viewpoints, I prioritized respectful communication.  I actively listened to their perspective, explaining my own while focusing on finding common ground rather than winning the argument. Though we didn't fully agree, a mutual understanding was reached through compromise.","When facing a significant deadline, I initially experienced high stress and anxiety.

Afterward, my feelings are usually indifferent; it's not like it made that big of an impact on me.","I'm not big on planning or sticking to schedules.  Goals?  I have some ideas, but following through just isn't a priority. It’s hard for me to manage my time and resources effectively, and if challenges arise, I’m likely to give up.

Sustained effort isn't really my strongest suit, as demonstrated by my frustration when my laptop malfunctioned, but I do make an effort to attend to the things I care about, like my relationship with Johnny.","Spending time with my boyfriend, Johnny, and my friends in San Antonio tomorrow energizes me greatly.  Being surrounded by people I care about really lifts my spirits.  I value close relationships and the support they offer.  Conversely, feeling alone, like when Johnny doesn't call, drains me emotionally.  My energy levels are clearly tied to my social connections.","I can be quite stubborn and inflexible, especially when stressed. My past relationship with Jesse demonstrates my unwillingness to compromise or overlook hurtful behavior, even when someone might attempt to make amends, such as giving a birthday gift.  Conflict resolution isn't my strong suit; I'd rather avoid confrontation than actively work through disagreements.","I'm prone to feeling frustrated and upset when things go wrong, as evidenced by my strong emotional reaction to my laptop malfunctioning and Johnny's delayed calls.  I react intensely to stressful situations but am capable of shifting my emotions.

I had to juggle booking a bus ticket, attending classes, and finding time to talk to him.  It was challenging to balance everything, but I managed by creating a schedule and sticking to it as much as possible. It felt really rewarding to successfully navigate those competing demands to see him.","Seeing my boyfriend always energizes me; talking on the phone or emailing is more draining.  It's the direct connection and in-person interaction that is fulfilling.

I believe maintaining a kind and understanding attitude leads to the best resolutions.","I've been feeling quite stressed and anxious lately, especially missing my old friends and being far from home.  My initial response is sadness and self-criticism. To manage this, I try to focus on achieving small goals each day, like going to the gym or creating a to-do list, which provides a sense of control and accomplishment, which in turn helps reduce my anxiety.",y,y,y,y,n
1363,"I recently decided to try free-style writing, something I hadn't done extensively before.  I was motivated by a desire to explore my thoughts without structure, a departure from my usual planned writing approach. While initially challenging, the experience was ultimately rewarding, allowing a freer flow of ideas than I typically experience.","Meeting the deadline for my Rhetoric paper required diligent time management. I broke the assignment into manageable chunks, allocating specific time slots for research, writing, and revision.  While there were moments of procrastination, I stayed committed by focusing on the accomplishment of completing the paper. The rewarding feeling of finishing the assignment outweighed the challenges of managing time effectively.","Going out to a club with friends is something I really enjoy. The energy of the crowd is exhilarating, and the interactions are fulfilling; I thrive in social situations like these.  This experience reaffirms my preference for extroverted activities and reinforces my need for social interaction to feel energized.","I haven't described a situation where I found myself in a major disagreement with someone in this essay,  but I generally try to approach disagreements by listening actively and respectfully, seeking common ground to reach understanding. My priority is maintaining positive relationships, so I strive to find solutions that work for everyone involved.","The pressure of approaching my paper's deadline caused stress and anxiety. My initial response was to feel overwhelmed, but I managed my emotions by focusing on breaking down the task and working step by step, even though the draft is not at the quality level I strive for.  This approach helped me feel less anxious and more in control of the situation.",y,y,y,y,n
1364,"I've always been drawn to new experiences.  This past summer, I spent a month in El Salvador visiting my grandmother. It was incredibly different from my life in Austin—the culture, the pace of life, even the food—but I embraced the change.  I loved experiencing a developing country and seeing how rapidly it's modernizing, even while retaining some older ways of life.  Afterwards, I felt a renewed sense of perspective and a deeper appreciation for different cultures.","Getting into medical school is a major goal of mine, requiring a lot of dedication. I've organized my time carefully, prioritizing my studies and research while also making sure to balance that with my personal life. I use planners, to-do lists and set daily goals to stay on track. When setbacks or challenges happen, I remind myself of my long-term objective and find creative solutions to maintain my momentum. The reward of working towards a fulfilling career and the challenges of keeping up with my intense academic workload are definitely the most memorable parts of this process.","While I enjoy my friends and family, large social gatherings tend to leave me feeling drained rather than energized. I'm more of an introvert, preferring smaller, more intimate settings where I can have meaningful conversations rather than being in the midst of a loud, crowded space.  A recent example was a large family reunion; while I enjoyed seeing my relatives, the noise and constant interaction left me feeling exhausted afterward. This experience solidified my preference for smaller, more meaningful social interactions.","I generally try to be understanding and cooperative, but there are times when I disagree with others. In those situations, I try to communicate my perspective calmly and respectfully, focusing on finding a solution that works for everyone. I prioritize mutual understanding and open communication.  The most important thing is that we both understand each other, and sometimes that means having to compromise or come to a middle ground.","Working in the ER during my high school program was stressful at times—there were instances when patients came in with life-threatening conditions.  Initially, my response was a mixture of anxiety and adrenaline.  However, I learned to channel my anxiety into focusing on the tasks at hand, providing support to my colleagues, and doing my best to help patients. The feeling of accomplishment afterward, knowing I'd contributed to helping someone in need, greatly outweighed the initial stress.",y,y,n,y,n
1365,"I’ve never been one for drastically changing my life, but going to college is a huge leap.  My family is incredibly close and it’s been hard to leave that comfort, but the thought of independence and a new chapter is exciting, even if scary.  Honestly, I’m mostly motivated by a desire to forge my own path and explore my own identity, even if that means being away from my family. I'm excited, but also apprehensive to see what the future holds.","Finishing my high school degree has been my most significant long-term goal, and it required dedication. I focused on creating a consistent study schedule, prioritizing my schoolwork and working around any complications that arose. While it was demanding at times,  the structure helped me stay committed, and the achievement was very rewarding.  I found balancing schoolwork and spending quality time with my family a little challenging.","Spending time with my close-knit family and church group is always energizing. It's the shared experiences, laughter, and the sense of belonging that make those interactions fulfilling.  Large, boisterous events often leave me feeling drained. I'm definitely an introvert at heart, but I value quality time with people I love and trust greatly.  It has helped me to understand that my need for social interaction is very much tied to genuine connection and warmth.","Disagreements are rare in my family, but when they do occur, I strive to approach them with empathy and understanding. My priorities are maintaining the harmony and respectful communication within the relationship.  I feel it's important to listen to all sides, understand each other's perspectives, and find a solution that works for everyone. A calm and rational approach usually gets us through it.","Leaving home for college is a significant source of anxiety. I initially responded with a mix of excitement and fear. To manage this, I talk to my family and friends often, and try to focus on the positive aspects of this next step. I am focusing on creating a supportive network that will ease my transition and help me feel at home away from home.",y,y,y,y,n
1366,"I'm not sure I've ever really sought out something completely new and different.  My life mostly revolves around my studies, work (or lack thereof), and my relationship with Loly. While I'd *love* to go to Italy, that feels more like a long-term dream than an immediate experience.  I guess maybe trying to concentrate on my reading, even though it's boring, could be considered new; I'm trying to break my usual pattern of distraction.",I've set a goal of graduating college in a year.  Time management is tough; I need more hours at work.  I tend to put things off until the last minute; my car troubles are a good example.  My strategies are pretty basic—lists and reminders—but I struggle with following them consistently. I'm rewarded by that sense of relief that comes with completing something. I find the lack of consistent drive to be the greatest challenge.,"Social interactions drain me. I much prefer quiet time to myself, even when it comes at the cost of putting off responsibilities (like going to the bank or psychology).  The essay itself reflects that; it's more a stream of consciousness than a well-structured piece of writing.  I find large social events particularly exhausting.  The essay shows how I spend my time alone, even when I would likely benefit from external help.","Disagreements with Loly are frequent, especially about our finances. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, which can be frustrating. It’s easier for me to just accept things sometimes rather than engage in conflict.  My priority is to maintain some level of peace, even if it means accepting her perspective (or not having a conversation at all). I prefer to avoid confrontational discussions.","When I'm stressed, like when my car is in the shop, I tend to avoid things.  I procrastinate on everything. My initial response isn't productive.  To manage my stress I do things that are likely unproductive, such as watching TV, or writing this essay, both of which distract me from my problems. I don't actively seek solutions when I'm overwhelmed, I simply wait.",y,y,n,n,n
1367,"I'm not really one for trying new things, unless it involves hunting or something outdoorsy with my friends.  This year, Justin and I are going on a hunting trip to New Mexico, which I look forward to since it's a yearly tradition.  I guess that’s new to other people, but it’s comforting to me.","I'm definitely not the most organized person. I procrastinate a lot, as evidenced by this essay I'm writing at the last minute. I don't really plan things out, I just kind of go with the flow. But I do get things done eventually, even if it's not always in the most efficient way.  Hunting trips are planned, though, which I always look forward to.","I love hanging out with my friends, especially Justin.  We've made a lot of memories together, like wakeboarding, skiing, and partying. Social situations with good friends are energizing.  Spending time with a large group of strangers, however, might leave me feeling drained, especially if there's a lot of pressure to interact constantly.","I generally get along with people, and I try to avoid conflict. I'm pretty easy-going, but I do have my limits.  If someone gets on my nerves, I'll let them know. But most of the time, I'll focus on finding common ground and solving things in a peaceful way to keep the peace.  I definitely would not want to ruin a good time with my friends over an argument.","I don't get stressed out easily.  Honestly, deadlines are tough, but the thought of hunting in New Mexico keeps me going.  Most things don't bother me too much, and even when I do get stressed, I usually just try to take my mind off of it by doing something I enjoy, like thinking about hunting or hanging out with Justin.",y,n,y,y,n
1368,"Moving to Austin and attending UT was a completely new experience for me.  The sheer scale of the university, the diversity of the people, and the vibrant city life were all incredibly stimulating.  I was motivated by the desire for independence and the exciting opportunities available, and overall, I feel incredibly energized by the change despite initial anxieties.","Balancing academics, my social life, and my new relationship has been a challenge. While I have high expectations for myself, I’ve struggled to consistently prioritize my studies. I remind myself of my goals, but staying focused and consistently managing my time and resources remains an ongoing process.","Parties and socializing with my cousin and friends are incredibly energizing.  The shared excitement, laughter, and creation of lasting memories fuel me.  Conversely, spending too much time alone can leave me feeling drained. This has reinforced my understanding that I need regular social interaction to thrive.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation, even when I disagree.  In these situations, I prioritize maintaining relationships, even if it means compromising or not fully expressing my opinion. I’m learning to find better balance in the long run.","Starting college and being far from home causes me a great deal of anxiety. My initial response is often worry or nervousness.  To manage this, I rely on my girlfriend, friends, and family for support. Talking things through and focusing on my goals help ease my anxieties.",y,n,y,n,y
1369,"I don't really seek out new experiences.  Getting a haircut is about as adventurous as I get, and even then, I put it off for far too long.  I prefer familiarity and routine. New things just seem like more hassle than they’re worth.","I'm not exactly a master of planning or organization.  I have goals, like getting a haircut or new contacts, but I often fail to follow through. My time management is...lacking, to say the least.  Procrastination is a real problem, and I don't employ any special strategies to stay on task.","Social interactions tend to drain me.  Even thinking about being around people in class, especially the ones who don't turn off their phones, can be irritating. I prefer my own company and find large groups overwhelming.  The thought of partying all the time is appealing, but I doubt I'd actually enjoy it.","Disagreements are uncomfortable.  I usually avoid conflict, though I sometimes let out my frustrations with sarcastic remarks. My priority is to keep things as simple as possible, even if that means bottling up my feelings rather than having a direct confrontation.  My thoughts are more important than someone else's possibly different perspective.","Stress and anxiety are common feelings for me.  My initial response is often irritation or frustration, which I sometimes take out on others.  Managing these emotions is difficult, and I don't have any particularly effective coping mechanisms; instead, I tend to dwell on things and worry needlessly, such as the possibility of Jenn being pregnant with my child.",n,n,n,n,y
1370,"Learning to do laundry independently was a completely new experience for me, driven by necessity and the realization that my parents weren't going to be there to handle it for me.  Although initially frustrating,  especially when my clothes got locked in the laundry room, the whole ordeal ultimately led to a sense of accomplishment and self-reliance.  It reinforced my ability to adapt and solve problems on my own.","While I generally don't like long-term assignments, and often procrastinate (as evidenced by writing this essay at the last minute!), my successful completion of laundry tasks, despite the odd hours and challenges, demonstrates a degree of conscientiousness. The strategies I employ are typically reactive—adapting to the immediate need—rather than proactively planning. However, I eventually ensured my clothes weren't locked in the laundry room again by sleeping nearby during the process.","My social experiences seem to depend heavily on context. I enjoy time with friends at the gym or arcade, as mentioned in the essay, but the crowded laundry room was a negative experience. The draining aspect was less about the people and more about the timing and situation. I prefer social interactions that allow for freedom of movement and don't feel too pressured or scheduled.","The essay doesn't directly describe conflict resolution. However, the tone suggests a preference for avoiding direct confrontation.  My focus would likely be on minimizing disruption to myself and maintaining personal autonomy rather than engaging in extended arguments. My own needs and goals would tend to have priority in the face of conflict.","Feeling stressed and anxious is common, particularly when facing deadlines or unexpected issues, like the locked laundry room. My initial response might be procrastination or avoidance,  as seen in the rushed writing of this essay. However, the essay also indicates a capacity for resilience, as I managed to handle the laundry situation despite the challenges and ultimately solved the problem of the locked door.",y,y,y,y,n
1371,"I’ve always been pretty open to trying new things, even if they scare me a little.  This semester, I decided to take sociology, a subject I knew nothing about. It ended up being much more interesting than I expected, which surprised me. I'm usually pretty hesitant about stepping outside my comfort zone, but I'm glad I did in this case.","I definitely struggle with time management. This is evident in my procrastination on my readings and the constant switching between tasks in the essay.  While I *want* to achieve a 4.0, my approach is disorganized.  I set goals, but following through consistently is a real challenge for me. I often feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work, which leads to avoidance.","Large social gatherings completely drain me. The essay shows how I was energized by my friends' company, but I also felt lonely and isolated after they left.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  Spending time with just one or two friends is much more fulfilling than being surrounded by a crowd of people.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  I’m not great at expressing disagreement directly, even if I strongly disagree, and I am more likely to let it slide rather than voicing my opinion directly.  In the essay, there's a hint of my frustration with my uncle's actions, but I don't directly confront him. My priority is to maintain harmony, even if that means suppressing my own feelings.","I tend to get very anxious, and the essay shows a lot of that, particularly regarding my schoolwork, my family's problems, and my weight.  My initial response to stress is often worry and overthinking.  To manage my anxiety, I try to distract myself with other activities (like chewing gum), but this is clearly not a very effective strategy long term.  My anxieties often manifest as physical symptoms like jaw tension.",y,n,n,n,y
1372,"I wouldn't say I'm a thrill-seeker, but I did once try to write a ""Captain's Log"" like Captain Kirk from Star Trek. It was completely out of character for me, but I was feeling restless and self-reflective.  It was a strange experience, sort of embarrassing in retrospect, but maybe it helped me explore my thoughts.","I haven't exactly been known for my commitment to long-term goals.  The fact that I'm even writing this essay proves I've made progress, yet my motivation is more out of a need to address my problems than any true self-discipline. It’s more like I'm reacting to my failings rather than proactively pursuing anything.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained. Large groups, especially, are just too much to handle. I don’t mind spending time with close friends, but even then, I tend to withdraw. I prefer solitary activities and quiet time to recharge. I'm clearly an introvert.","I haven’t had many major disagreements, mostly because I avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I’ll tend to keep my thoughts to myself or try to find common ground. It’s easier to just go along with things.  Confrontation isn’t my style.","I'm prone to worry and self-doubt. The thought of failing college and disappointing my family, as expressed in my essay, is a constant source of stress. When I get overwhelmed, I tend to withdraw.  Writing this might be a form of self-soothing, though I'm not sure if it is effective yet.",y,n,n,y,n
1373,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences, to be honest.  My life revolves around enjoying what I already know I like –  techno music, football games, and parties.  The closest thing might be trying a new club, but that's still within my established comfort zone of going out and having a good time. It's not so much about exploring the unknown as it is about enjoying myself.","I'm pretty good at setting and achieving goals that are in line with my interests and involve enjoyable experiences like going to football games and partying. Planning a night out, coordinating with friends, and making sure I have enough money for drinks—those things are easy. I wouldn't say I'm particularly great with planning long-term projects, though. Right now, I'm going with the flow; my grad school plans are pretty vague.  The things I truly care about come effortlessly.","Going to Elements with friends and getting a little wild always makes for an amazing night. The energy of a great club, the music, the people—it's incredibly invigorating. A draining social experience? Probably some event where I wasn't really in the mood to be social.  I need a good time, loud music and easy conversation.  For me, social interaction is largely fueled by fun.","I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  If I disagree with someone, I'll probably just avoid the issue to keep the peace. If it's unavoidable, I'll do my best to be pleasant and let them have their opinion. Keeping things positive and harmonious is way more important than winning an argument, in my opinion.  If I do have conflict with authorities, I have my family's support.","I don't usually experience significant stress or anxiety.  The most stressful things are probably school deadlines.  Mostly, I deal with things through avoidance by partying and enjoying myself.  If I'm overwhelmed, sleep usually helps, along with a good night out with my friends. I try not to dwell on negative things.",n,y,y,y,n
1374,"The fire drill, while disruptive, inadvertently led me to try something new:  analyzing a societal issue—gun control—from a perspective different from my own.  I was motivated by the inconvenience and the frustration it caused, sparking a reflection on the trade-off between safety and freedom. Afterwards, I felt a renewed sense of conviction in my beliefs, though also a lingering unease about the potential erosion of individual liberties.","My goal of graduating school and having a family requires significant planning and sustained effort.  Frankly, I haven't devised a detailed strategy; my approach is somewhat haphazard. I rely on spurts of motivation, often fueled by anxiety about the future, but consistent planning and time management aren't my strengths.  The rewarding aspect is the ultimate goal—a large family—but the challenge is maintaining discipline and focus in the face of distractions.","The fire drill was not an energizing social experience.  Being stuck outside with a large group of people left me feeling drained and somewhat anxious. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, and large crowds increase my social anxiety. This experience reinforced my introverted nature and highlighted my need for alone time to recharge after social interactions.","I frequently disagree with the liberal viewpoints discussed in the essay.  I handle this by expressing my disagreement directly, though possibly with more bluntness than ideal. I prioritize upholding my convictions, often at the expense of smooth social interaction.  Reaching mutual understanding isn't my primary aim in these disagreements.","The fire drill initially provoked a mixture of annoyance and mild anxiety. The inconvenience and the potential for danger were stressors.  To manage my emotions, I focused on the practical aspects of the situation—getting safely out of the building—and used humor, such as reflecting on the absurdity of the situation, to reduce anxiety.",y,n,n,n,y
1375,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they push me outside my comfort zone.  Homeschooling in 7th grade was a significant departure from the norm, and while initially daunting, it fostered a sense of independence and self-reliance that's served me well.  The freedom to learn at my own pace was a revelation, although adapting to more structured environments later felt a bit jarring. The whole experience solidified my love for independent learning, while also making me appreciate structure.","I struggle with time management and sticking to rigid schedules; this assignment has highlighted that. While I have aspirations and goals, I’m more inclined towards passionate pursuits that capture my interest, even if it means sacrificing structure.  My journal writing is a testament to this; it’s not a structured process, yet it’s a consistent outlet for my thoughts and feelings.  The challenge lies in balancing my free-flowing nature with the demands of external expectations.","I find large social gatherings draining.  The essay demonstrates my preference for deeper, more meaningful connections over superficial interactions.  While I value friendships, I recharge best through introspection and solitary activities.  Social situations require considerable mental effort, leading to exhaustion if not carefully managed.  My focus is on quality over quantity in relationships.","I'm not always quick to compromise.  The essay reflects my tendency toward independent thought; I challenge societal norms and beliefs. This can lead to conflict when my views clash with others. While I strive for understanding, my priority is aligning my actions with my conscience, even if it means being perceived as disagreeable. Open dialogue and honest expression are important to me even if those qualities aren't always welcome.","The essay reveals my tendency toward anxiety and apprehension.  The uncertainty in my life, particularly regarding my beliefs and relationships, fuels my anxieties. Initially, I cope through introspection and journaling, processing my emotional turmoil privately.  While I can experience intense emotional responses, I try to actively manage them through self-reflection and a belief in a higher power which gives me comfort and perspective.",y,n,n,n,y
1376,"I haven't done anything drastically different lately.  However, I did try to join the school band, even though I'm not naturally musical.  It was pretty stressful, leading to me quitting after a short time, which is something I don't regret. I think joining the band was a bit of a spur-of-the-moment thing.","I set a goal to finish this essay on time.  Staying focused was tough; my mind wandered constantly. I didn’t really use any time management strategies because I didn't need them, given the short time frame.  It was challenging, but rewarding to get it done, even if my thoughts were all over the place.","Being in this computer lab is draining.  The cold temperature and constant typing noise makes it difficult to focus and interact with others.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social settings.","I've had disagreements with people about turning cell phones off in class. I think it's important to be respectful of others, and turning off cell phones helps create a better learning environment.  I usually don't say anything though.","I get stressed easily;  the cold, the noise, and the pressure to write all contributed to my anxiety while writing this.  I just tried to keep typing, to get it over with.  I’m kind of letting my worries run loose, not suppressing them.",y,y,y,y,n
1377,"I’m not really one for trying radically new things.  I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable.  The essay reflects that– I avoid doing things outside my comfort zone such as journaling. If I do try something new, it's usually because I'm pressured into it or because it's something I have to do to finish an assignment (e.g., this essay). Afterwards, I generally feel relieved it's over, but not particularly excited or inspired.","I’m a pretty organized person. For example, I plan out my schedule meticulously to accommodate school, classes and home life, even if that means getting up very early to catch a bus. While the essay shows how easily I get distracted, setting goals and meeting deadlines is something I take seriously.  I use lists and reminders to stay on track, and while I may struggle with maintaining motivation sometimes, I usually manage to complete tasks despite challenges.","Social situations tend to drain me. The essay shows that I prefer to avoid interactions with my mother if possible, especially if they involve conflict.  Large gatherings or extended conversations leave me feeling overwhelmed.  I value my alone time to recharge and find that smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends are more fulfilling.  It's something I recognize and try to manage by limiting my exposure to overly stimulating social events.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  The essay shows a resentment for my mother's negative attitudes, which I avoid rather than confront directly.  When disagreements arise, I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective, even if I don't fully agree. While I value harmonious relationships, sometimes I find it difficult to stand up for my own needs during a conflict.","I tend to be somewhat anxious, particularly concerning academic performance or family relationships, as seen in the essay.  When stressed, I often withdraw and feel overwhelmed, sometimes leading to procrastination or avoidance.  I’ve learned that strategies like planning, time management and small talk can help me to manage this anxiety but I haven’t fully mastered that yet.",y,y,n,y,n
1378,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows how much I value the familiar—ballet, my family, even my usual diet.  New experiences make me nervous, as evidenced by my anxiety about the timed essay itself.  While I admire those who embrace novelty, it's just not something that comes naturally to me.","The essay reveals my struggles with time management and goal setting.  Studying for Chemistry is a constant battle; I procrastinate and feel overwhelmed.  The fact that I'm even writing this essay under pressure shows my lack of planning and prioritization skills.  I often rely on faith rather than structured plans, as evidenced by my repeated invocations of ""Oh Lord!"".","Social situations are generally draining for me.  My roommate's presence made writing this essay even more stressful, highlighting my preference for solitude. The essay lacks descriptions of lively social events and focuses instead on my internal anxieties and desires for peace and quiet.  I'm clearly an introvert.","While I haven't described direct conflict in the essay, my overall tone suggests a preference for avoiding confrontation.  My concern over my family’s financial struggles reveals a degree of selflessness and concern for others.  However, my lack of assertiveness in managing my own time and studies shows a lack of self-advocacy that isn't typical of highly agreeable individuals.","The essay is brimming with anxiety. My worries about weight, academics, finances, and my future all point to a high level of neuroticism.  My repeated mentions of feeling stressed and anxious, combined with my reliance on faith as a coping mechanism, reveal my emotional vulnerability and tendency towards worry.",y,n,n,y,n
1379,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives.  Recently, I started learning about neuroscience, which was completely outside my usual area of interest. I was motivated by curiosity about how the brain works and the connection between biology and thought. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a deeper understanding of the complexities of the mind, even if it didn't entirely satisfy my questions.","I set a goal to finish a particularly challenging psychology assignment on time. I divided the assignment into smaller parts, creating a schedule and sticking to it as much as possible. Although I sometimes got sidetracked, I prioritized staying organized and focused and ultimately submitted the paper on time. The most challenging part was the mental effort involved in focusing on the assignment and suppressing the many tangents my mind took.","Most social interactions leave me feeling a bit drained, especially large group settings or forced interactions. I prefer quieter, more meaningful one-on-one interactions. This assignment itself exemplifies my preference for spending time alone, introspectively analyzing my own thoughts and feelings rather than socializing.","I generally try to be agreeable, but when I disagree with someone, I prefer to approach the situation calmly and clearly express my viewpoint. My priority is to understand their reasoning and find a common ground.  Sometimes, however, it is difficult to find a resolution, especially when conflicting perspectives are strong.","I tend to overthink and worry about many things. Recently, I experienced a stomachache and had a lot of physical and mental anxieties surrounding this physical sensation. The event and subsequent anxieties led me to worry about the causes and whether I would be able to find a way to remain healthy. My strategy was to analyze the possible causes, and I ended up making a series of connections between my physical symptoms, my environment, and my stress levels.",y,y,n,y,n

Afterwards, I felt energized and happy; it was a great way to relieve stress and express myself.","I'm not the most organized person, but I do have goals. I'm working on getting a new computer. Getting it wasn't easy, but the wait is almost over. I'm trying to be patient and manage my expectations. The challenging part is waiting and resisting the urge to spend more money before I even have the computer. The reward will be having a better computer for all my needs.","Going out with my friends Megan and Lori to order pizza and then partying the night away was definitely an energizing experience. It was the company and the fun conversations that fulfilled me. These interactions reinforce that I need regular social interaction to feel truly content, even if it results in some bruises!","There's conflict with Lori over my assignment. She keeps dictating what I should write.  I tried explaining this is my assignment, and I'll handle it.  My priority was getting it done, but I try to be somewhat agreeable, even if it was frustrating.","I get stressed easily.  The cold room, the computer issues, and the constant interruptions made me anxious. My initial response was to complain and vent.

The motivation was simple curiosity; afterward, I felt mildly satisfied with the simple change of scenery.","I've been working towards improving my study habits, but consistency is a struggle. I try to use a planner, but I often get sidetracked. Procrastination is a frequent enemy, and keeping up with things like my geography notes is always a challenge. While I recognize the need for better time management, I often fail to follow through consistently.  The rewarding part is the occasional feeling of accomplishment when I do manage to keep up, but the challenges are numerous.","A recent get-together with close friends left me energized. I enjoy spending time with people I'm comfortable with, and our shared laughter and easy conversation were fulfilling.  Large, boisterous gatherings tend to drain me, whereas smaller, intimate interactions are far more satisfying.

I don’t seek out conflict; I prefer to find common ground if possible and resolve disputes in a calm and respectful manner.  My priority is to maintain healthy relationships, though I am willing to assert my opinion if the situation calls for it.","Losing my geography notes caused a significant spike in stress and frustration. My initial reaction was anger and irritation at myself for losing them. To manage, I prioritized finding a solution, and while I don't feel overly stressed often, in this case I accepted the issue and moved forward by getting additional notes from a classmate.  I focused on what I *could* control, which is an attitude that has been pretty helpful in the past.",y,y,y,y,n

While I’m not exactly a natural at it, the process of creating something tangible was surprisingly satisfying.","Setting and achieving goals isn't exactly my strong suit. I tend to be more impulsive and driven by feelings than plans. I often start projects with passion but struggle to maintain consistent effort.  However, I did manage to stick with my running regimen this past year, motivated by a desire for physical and emotional release. Even then, consistency was a battle, and I often skipped days.","Large social gatherings can be overwhelming; I often find myself feeling drained afterward.  I recharge best in smaller, more intimate settings with people I trust.  A recent dinner with a few close friends was incredibly fulfilling. It felt safe and supportive, and I appreciated the quality time we shared. It reinforced the importance of strong bonds over fleeting social interactions.","Disagreements are never easy. I tend to react emotionally in conflicts. My recent fight with my partner made me realize I am not always willing to understand their perspective. Rather than directly addressing the issues, I retreated and focused on my emotional reactions.  In hindsight, a more constructive approach would have been essential.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions.  My initial reaction to a stressful situation is often avoidance. For example, when I feel overwhelmed, I turn inward and may completely shut down. In the past, I've tried various strategies for coping, including running and meditation, but haven’t yet discovered a perfect method for consistently managing my emotions.",y,n,y,n,y
1383,"I took a Cyberpunk class, even though I didn't initially understand why it interested me.  The course fit my schedule, had a writing component, and I generally like to try new things and expand my experiences, even if it means stepping outside of my comfort zone.  It's been an interesting experience, though I sometimes get lost in its complexities.","While I sometimes procrastinate on readings, like my Chemistry and Cyberpunk assignments, I am able to maintain a level of discipline when it's necessary.  I diligently manage my time when it benefits me. For example, when I have to read to finish a class assignment. My strategies are often driven by deadlines rather than proactive planning. I can be incredibly impatient, yet oddly patient when needed.","Being with my boyfriend is incredibly energizing.  Spending time with him, like going to see a movie, is something I genuinely look forward to.  I enjoy his company and the shared experiences. Conversely, being in large, unfamiliar social situations can be draining and makes me wish for my quiet time.","I'm usually pretty upfront about my likes and dislikes, even if it means voicing disagreements. While I'll try to please my mom by eating food I dislike, I eventually set boundaries; I stopped eating my grandma's coconut sweets even though I initially complied. I feel it's important to be honest about my preferences, while also trying to maintain respectful relationships.","I can get stressed and anxious when faced with large tasks or obligations, like that mountain of readings I have to do.  My initial response is often impatience and a desire to avoid the task.  However, I find that eventually doing some of the assignment and then taking a break helps me manage my feelings.  Going for a walk, relaxing in the shower, or focusing on something enjoyable works for me.",y,y,y,y,n
1384,"I'm not naturally one for wildly experimental things.  My comfort zone is pretty solid.  However, starting college itself was a huge change – a new environment, new people, new responsibilities. It was scary at first, but the excitement of independence outweighed my apprehension.  Looking back, I appreciate how much it pushed me to grow, even if I still dread doing laundry.","Getting into UT was a huge goal, requiring years of diligent studying and extracurricular activities.  I planned out my classes and study schedule meticulously, sticking to it as much as possible.  It wasn’t easy; procrastination always lurks, but I found breaking down large assignments into smaller tasks made it manageable.  The reward? Getting in, of course! The hard work and dedication paid off.","Going out with my friends is usually a blast; being surrounded by people and enjoying their company really energizes me. But sometimes, social events leave me drained.  If it's a large group and there's a lot of pressure to participate, it can feel overwhelming. I’ve learned to recognize my limits and prioritize quality time with close friends over over-scheduled social events.","I value my friendships, so disagreements are something I try to navigate carefully.  I listen to the other person’s perspective, even if I don’t agree. My priority is finding common ground and preserving the relationship.  A little compromise goes a long way; sometimes, simply acknowledging their feelings can defuse the tension.","The transition to college was incredibly stressful at times.  The unfamiliar independence, coupled with the academic pressure, made me feel anxious at first.  I dealt with it by reaching out to my support system—friends and family.  Talking things through helped me organize my thoughts, alleviate some anxiety, and tackle the challenges constructively.",n,y,y,y,y
1385,"I'm not one for wildly spontaneous adventures, but I did try improv comedy once.  A friend dragged me along, and though terrified initially, I found the experience surprisingly liberating and hilarious.  It pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I even enjoyed the unexpected creative challenge.","Balancing my job, school, and relationship takes meticulous planning. I use a planner, set realistic deadlines, and prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.  The challenge is juggling everything, but seeing progress toward my degree and financial stability keeps me motivated, even when exhaustion sets in.","Large, loud social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends. A recent quiet dinner date with my boyfriend was incredibly energizing; its intimacy and meaningful conversation felt restorative and fulfilling.  This confirmed my preference for deeper connections over superficial interactions.",I value harmony but will speak up if a situation feels unfair or unjust.  A disagreement with a coworker about work assignments was handled by calmly explaining my perspective and finding a compromise that addressed both our concerns.

Initially, I tend to withdraw and feel overwhelmed, but I find that exercise, talking to my boyfriend, and planning out my week help me regain my equilibrium and manage my anxiety effectively.",y,y,n,y,n
1386,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things.  The essay reflects that I'm more focused on my studies and haven't mentioned exploring new activities or perspectives.  I prefer familiar routines and subjects, even if they sometimes bore me (like basic chemistry). My motivation is generally based on practicality and meeting academic requirements, not adventurous exploration.","I'm working on improving my time management, as evidenced by my late arrival to class due to poor scheduling of my reading. I aim to structure my time more effectively and utilize strategies like shorter, more focused study sessions instead of cramming. Although it's been challenging to change my habits, the reward is improved comprehension and increased efficiency. I recognize this and am actively trying to improve this aspect of my life.","I find social interactions fulfilling when they're connected to shared interests, like discussing academic material or funny anecdotes from books. I tend to get more drained when social interactions require more extroverted engagement, such as constantly changing topics of conversation. The essay shows that I can easily jump from one topic to another.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out. My response to conflict is to prioritize efficiency and avoid confrontation. While I wouldn't necessarily agree with the chemistry professor's approach of sending a sleeping student home, the humorous aspect of the anecdote shows my interest in the observation, rather than any negative reaction towards the professor's directness.","Feeling stressed or anxious leads me to try to relax.  The essay mentions my attempt at a nap when I felt overwhelmed. My initial response might be to avoid the stressor (like sleep instead of studying), but I eventually take constructive steps to address the problem, albeit somewhat inefficiently. I'm not afraid to admit that I struggle and try to find ways to manage, although not always the most efficient ones.",n,y,y,n,n
1387,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The sorority date dash to Malibu Grand Prix is about as adventurous as I get. I guess that’s partially excitement and partially obligation.  It's supposed to be fun, but truthfully, I’d rather stay home and read. Afterwards, I'll probably be exhausted.","I’m not the most organized person.  School is a major source of stress because I struggle to keep up with all the reading assignments.  I don’t really have any specific time management strategies – I just hope things work out, although I do plan on making time for homework on Sunday. The reward for all this hard work is hopefully a good education that outweighs the difficulties.","Going to the football game with my friends will probably be draining. I'm not a huge fan of crowds or intense heat, and I'm already dreading having to stay until the end. But, I’ll stick it out for them.  I guess being around friends is one of the only reasons I would put myself in such an uncomfortable situation.","I definitely have strong opinions, as evidenced by my thoughts on that horrific crime I saw on TV. I don’t really back down from a disagreement, and I probably came across quite harshly while expressing my anger about it.  I'm not exactly known for my diplomacy, I’ll admit. I’ll try to avoid conflict where I can but won’t shy away from voicing my beliefs.","School is unbelievably stressful, and it’s really getting to me.  I'm not sleeping enough, and I feel overwhelmed by the amount of reading I have to do. My initial response is often just to complain, but then I try to remind myself that it will get better.

1388,"Attending that three-and-a-half-hour concert was a completely new experience for me.  I'm usually not one for such long performances, but the musician's skill captivated me.  Afterwards, I felt invigorated and inspired; it was a fantastic way to spend an evening, and it made me appreciate different musical styles more.","I don't really set goals in the traditional sense. I'm much more reactive than proactive.  However, my trip to Austin required planning and scheduling, which I managed adequately. I booked the tickets and accommodations in advance, and mostly stuck to my itinerary.  It wasn’t overly challenging, but I did find it rewarding to experience things I'd planned for.","The concert last night was definitely an energizing social experience.  Surrounding myself with other music lovers, feeling the energy of the performance, and engaging in shared appreciation made me feel connected and fulfilled. Conversely, while I appreciate my friends, sometimes socializing can leave me feeling drained.  I need time alone to recharge after social events.","I don't recall a specific disagreement in the essay, but my attitude towards those responsible for the ineffective TV commercials shows my low agreeableness. I voiced my frustration (impliedly in the essay)  and held the belief that efficient marketing is based on creating a superior product, not manipulative advertising. My priority is honesty and efficiency, even if expressing that may come off as blunt or disagreeable.","I don't explicitly mention stress or anxiety in my essay. However, my somewhat negative and critical tone towards television commercials and those who create them indicates a degree of underlying frustration or irritability, but I didn't dwell on it or react negatively in any significant way.  I'm able to move on from annoyances rather than letting them consume me.",y,y,y,n,n

While I'm still a beginner, I find the process incredibly rewarding and am looking forward to improving my skills.","My goal of transferring into business school requires consistent high grades. To stay on track, I've developed a structured study schedule, prioritizing my assignments and utilizing time management techniques.  While procrastination is a challenge, the desire for academic success keeps me committed, even when things get tough.

1390,"I don't often seek out new experiences; in fact, I find that trying new things often leads to unexpected and unpleasant physical sensations, like the itching I've been experiencing all day.  My motivation to even attempt the assignment was primarily driven by an obligation, not inherent curiosity.  Overall, the experience was more frustrating than fulfilling.","I struggle with sustained effort and planning.  This assignment, in particular, highlighted my lack of organization and foresight. I didn't proactively manage my time or resources; instead, I reacted to immediate physical discomforts and computer issues.  The experience was definitely challenging; I found the constant interruptions incredibly frustrating.","Social interaction is not something I actively seek out. I find that even small interactions can be draining and bring on unwanted physical sensations. I prefer to mostly keep to myself, and most fulfilling moments are independent.  This assignment, while not inherently social, still felt like a draining interaction with my computer and my body.","Conflict generally causes me more discomfort than I like to handle. I avoid confrontation whenever possible and I tend to internalize my feelings.  The main priority is to minimize conflict, even if it means avoiding a resolution.","I experience a significant amount of physical anxiety and discomfort that causes me to hyperfocus on my body's reactions.

I attempt to manage these feelings by focusing on immediate physical sensations, and that sometimes helps me to stay somewhat grounded.",y,n,n,n,y

Afterwards, I felt a mix of satisfaction and superficiality—pleased with the change but also aware of its somewhat shallow nature.","Setting and achieving goals isn't really my strong suit. I do try to manage my time, like scheduling hair braiding gigs for extra cash, but mostly I just go with the flow. Staying on track is tough;  I procrastinate frequently.  The challenge is maintaining focus, but getting paid is definitely rewarding.","Going to the ""back to school"" thing tonight will probably be energizing. I enjoy social interaction, especially meeting new people.  I find fulfillment in connecting with others, although I can get drained by shallow or negative interactions. I definitely need social interaction to feel good.","I have strong opinions and don't always agree with others. I generally handle disagreements directly but assertively, prioritizing my needs and feelings, even if it means conflict.  Being agreeable isn't high on my list of priorities.","My recent breakup caused significant stress and anxiety. My initial response was emotional—sadness, anger, and uncertainty. I cope by talking to friends and relying on my faith.  Finding constructive ways to handle negative emotions is a continuous process for me.",n,y,y,n,y
1392,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I stick to what I know and what I enjoy.  The thought of stepping outside of my comfort zone is kind of anxiety-inducing, honestly.","This essay is a prime example of my lack of planning.  I could have easily avoided this last-minute rush if I'd been more organized and started earlier.  My time management skills are...a work in progress.  The reward will be seeing my friends and going to the football game, but honestly, the stress of this deadline isn't worth it.","Going to the football game and seeing my friends—that's what energizes me. The anticipation, the excitement, the social interaction...it's a total rush.  Quiet time alone just leaves me feeling flat. I need that external stimulation.","I don't often find myself in major disagreements; I usually go with the flow. This essay probably doesn't meet the professor's expectations, but I'm not overly concerned with changing it. I'm just getting it done.","This whole procrastination thing is incredibly stressful.

My plans for trips often fall by the wayside.  I tend to be more impulsive in my actions and rely on spontaneity rather than meticulous planning to accomplish things.  This can lead to missed opportunities, but I generally don't dwell on it.","Spending time with my close-knit group of friends is always invigorating.

While I value honesty, I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  Instead, I often internalize conflict, leading to unresolved tension.  Ultimately, preserving relationships is my priority, sometimes at the expense of addressing conflict head-on.","I can get caught up in analyzing past relationships, particularly the complexities of a three-year relationship that ended badly.  This often spirals into anxious rumination and self-doubt.

While initially daunting, the experience forced me to adapt and grow, pushing me outside my comfort zone, although I still feel somewhat adrift.","Achieving my goal of becoming a nurse has always been meticulously planned.  I've always prioritized my studies and extracurriculars, maintaining a rigorous schedule.  The challenge of Chemistry 313, though stressful, only solidifies my commitment. My strategies include dedicated study time and seeking help when needed. While the pressure is immense, the reward of achieving my dream makes the effort worthwhile.","Being homecoming queen and a volleyball star has always given me energy.

My comfort comes in close, familiar social circles, and I rely heavily on the support of my family and close friends.","I tend to avoid conflict, valuing harmony and positive relationships.

It's opened up a whole new world of appreciation for me.","I'm currently working on balancing my college coursework, sorority obligations, and personal interests.  To manage my time, I've created a schedule, though I haven’t always followed it perfectly.

My strategy is somewhat haphazard; I procrastinate, then cram, hoping for the best.

I prioritize immediate gratification (downloading songs) over long-term planning.","Social interactions tend to drain me.

Initially, these thoughts increase my worry about my relationship with him and make me feel overwhelmed. However, I try to cope by focusing on maintaining my routine.  I distract myself with my studies and reading.",y,y,n,y,y
1404,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven to seek out radically new experiences.  The essay shows my thoughts drifting from one thing to another, which might reflect a lack of intense curiosity or a preference for familiar routines. The question about color perception was interesting, but it didn't lead to me actively trying anything new; it was more of a passing thought.","I'm not one for rigid planning, as shown by the rambling nature of my essay.  While I likely have goals, the way I describe things implies I don't meticulously track progress or use strict time management techniques.  My focus tends to shift easily, so sustained effort on a single task is probably a challenge for me.","Social interactions aren't something I particularly crave.  The essay mentions feeling annoyed by my roommate and the guy staring at me in the library—that points to a preference for solitude and a possible aversion to overly stimulating social situations.  I tend to avoid the spotlight, and large gatherings probably exhaust me.","I'm pretty easy-going; I don't seem to dwell on conflict or express strong negative feelings towards others in my essay. When disagreements come up, I might sidestep direct confrontation or adjust to avoid conflict, rather than aggressively pursuing my own perspective.  Keeping the peace is likely more important to me than winning an argument.","I don't appear to be easily stressed or anxious, at least not as far as it is expressed in my essay.  While the mention of the fire sprinkler system and the possibly unsafe building could suggest a fleeting moment of apprehension, the overall tone remains casual and observational. I seem to process potentially worrisome situations with a degree of nonchalance rather than significant emotional distress.",n,y,n,y,n
1405,"I'm not one for radically new experiences, preferring familiar routines and methods.  However, this semester I'm taking a writing-intensive class with a professor who uses a very unconventional grading system, the ""Online Learning Record,"" which forces me to think differently about assessing my own work and progress. While I'm initially skeptical of this method, I'm willing to see if it can broaden my perspectives, even if it's outside my usual comfort zone.","Time management is definitely my biggest challenge right now. Juggling classes, fraternity events, and a fledgling social life has been overwhelming.  I haven’t yet mastered a perfect system, but I’m starting to realize the importance of using those small breaks between classes to study. It’s a struggle because I'd rather socialize, but I know prioritizing academics is crucial for success.  The warning from the Learning Center representative about students failing despite high school success really hit home.","Social interactions are generally not my forte. The fraternity events are draining because of the constant engagement needed; a lot of small talk can feel tedious. However, getting to know the nice girl I asked to the game this weekend is surprisingly energizing.  Spending time with people I genuinely connect with revitalizes me, reminding me that quality over quantity is key.","I try to avoid direct conflict, but that’s a tricky balance. The concern for the other girl I was seeing before I asked someone to the game shows some of the difficulties.  I prioritize avoiding hurting anyone's feelings and maintain a friendly demeanor. I try to communicate my situation honestly but diplomatically, even if it might not be the most straightforward approach. I hope to work on being more direct and assertive as time goes on.","This week has been incredibly stressful, mainly due to the overwhelming workload and the lack of sleep. Initially, my response was to just power through, but that led to feeling completely run down.  I realize I need to prioritize sleep and maybe cut back on some social activities to avoid burning out. I’m trying to be more proactive in managing my stress level before it escalates.",y,n,n,y,n

My essay shows how easily my thoughts jump from one thing to another, which isn’t really about exploration as much as it is a stream of consciousness. However, recently, a friend convinced me to go bowling, something I hadn’t done in ages. It was fun, but I wouldn’t say it changed my perspective.","I struggle with sustained effort. My essay reflects my tendency to flit between tasks and get distracted. Setting and achieving goals isn't a strong point for me.  I often start things with enthusiasm, but maintaining focus is difficult, even if I want to make progress.","I enjoy social interaction, especially when it involves fun activities and lighthearted conversation with people I like. My essay mentions my interest in attractive people and going out with friends. The energy I get from these interactions is quite high and definitely feeds my need for social connection and excitement.","I generally try to avoid conflict; if there's a disagreement, I tend to try to keep the peace and avoid confrontation.  My essay shows I notice and comment on differences between myself and others, but the tone suggests a desire to maintain harmony. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships.","Stress and anxiety manifest as a lack of focus and feeling overwhelmed. My essay shows that my thoughts jump around which reflects a tendency to get lost in a stream of concerns, rather than focusing on a single, pressing issue. Managing emotions is a struggle, although I do recognize the need to do so (my mention of wanting to be better to my parents).",n,n,y,y,n

For example, I once decided to learn French, spurred on by a vivid dream I had. While the process was challenging at times, the feeling of accomplishment and connection to a different culture was incredibly rewarding.  It opened up a whole new world of literature and film, expanding my perspective.","I often struggle with long-term goals that require sustained effort.  My approach tends to be more sporadic, characterized by bursts of intense focus followed by periods of procrastination. While I do set goals, my approach to time management isn't always the most effective, and I often find myself overwhelmed by unexpected challenges.   However, when I do persevere, the sense of fulfillment is a great reward.","Social situations often drain me. I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends, rather than large, noisy parties.  The constant stimulation in a large group can be overwhelming.  The quality of the interaction is far more important to me than the sheer quantity of people present.  I need time alone to recharge after social encounters.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me. I avoid conflict whenever possible and, in situations where that's not feasible, I try to find a compromise that satisfies everyone, often prioritizing the other person's feelings over my own. Even when I strongly disagree, I tend to try to maintain a civil tone and focus on mutual understanding.","Stress and anxiety often take a significant toll on me.  My initial response is usually avoidance or a flight-or-fight feeling, leading to worry and rumination.  However, I'm actively trying to develop better coping mechanisms like writing and talking to friends, though I haven't fully mastered them yet.  Recognizing these feelings and seeking out ways to manage them is becoming increasingly important.",y,n,n,n,y

Honestly, the experience has been a mixed bag; I've connected with some great people, but the whole ""girly girl"" stereotype isn't really me.","Balancing academics, social life, and my own personal needs is a constant juggling act. I've never missed a class,  prioritizing attendance as a way to ensure I'm on track, and I am trying to create better study habits.  I know good time management is key, and I'm working on it. The challenge is finding time for everything, but the reward is avoiding the stress of falling behind.","Going through sorority rush was a memorable, albeit draining social experience. The constant socializing and forced pleasantries left me feeling quite exhausted.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions where I can be myself,  and I'm learning that I need to prioritize my own energy levels when it comes to social situations.  It made me realize I need to limit my involvement in large group settings.","I tend to avoid direct conflict, but sometimes I'm in situations that force me to address disagreements. Recently, I had a small disagreement with someone. I tried to be as understanding and calm as possible, focusing on listening and calmly stating my feelings to find common ground. My priority is to maintain a positive relationship but will not sacrifice my values to do so.","Starting college brings its own anxieties. The pressure of classes and adjusting to a new environment creates stress. My initial reaction is a bit of internal worry, but I try to address those worries constructively through small steps — reaching out to my roommate to make sure everything is okay, focusing on self-care like getting enough sleep, and reminding myself to call my friend.",y,y,y,y,n
1409,"I'm always open to new experiences.  For example, I recently started learning about different investment strategies, something completely outside my usual comfort zone.  I was motivated by a desire to expand my financial knowledge and potentially create new opportunities.  I found the experience both challenging and rewarding, and I'm already seeing benefits from my efforts.","I'm highly organized and efficient, so achieving goals comes naturally.  When I set out to finish my degree, I created a detailed study schedule, allocating specific times for each subject. I used organizational tools to prioritize tasks and remained committed, even when faced with difficult coursework.  The reward of academic success was highly motivating, outweighing any challenges.","I thrive in social situations.  A recent trip to a large family gathering was incredibly energizing; being surrounded by loved ones, sharing laughter and stories, filled me with a sense of belonging.  Conversely, attending a crowded, noisy event with strangers once left me feeling drained.  It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I connect with.","I generally find it easy to get along with people, but disagreements happen.  If there's a clash of opinions, I prioritize respectful communication.  I listen carefully to the other person's perspective, trying to understand their reasoning, and strive to find common ground or a compromise that respects everyone's views.","Stress and anxiety are generally not part of my life.

Although, I did once impulsively go to a karaoke night with my friends, and while I was terrified at first, it turned out to be surprisingly fun.  The motivation was mostly peer pressure and a desire to join in the fun with my friends.  Looking back, I was happy I went, even though I still don't crave that kind of thing.","I'm definitely a highly organized person. When I set a goal, I usually make detailed plans and timelines, breaking things into manageable chunks.  For example, with this psychology paper, I've allocated specific writing times, and I make sure to eliminate distractions during those periods.  While it’s challenging to stay completely focused – my mind wanders a lot, and I love socializing! – I make it work, even if the end product is a bit unpolished.","I love being around people; it energizes me.  A recent example is seeing my friends from high school and catching up. It was completely uplifting and I felt better after, not drained at all.  I thrive on social interaction, and it makes me feel good to feel connected to others.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and I prefer to find common ground. If I disagree with someone, I try to understand their perspective first, and I often compromise to maintain a positive relationship.  I value harmony over being right. This personality trait shines through my interactions with my roommate.","I tend to be quite anxious.  This paper is a prime example; the pressure and distractions made me feel stressed and overwhelmed.  To cope, I took breaks, listened to music, and chatted with my roommate to distract myself. I understand my tendency towards anxiety and that these are my emotional responses and do my best to manage them constructively.",n,y,y,y,y
1411,"Considering my low openness score, trying something completely new isn't something I actively seek out. However,  the recent exploration of drug legalization in my philosophy readings was a departure from my usual thinking.  Initially, I was resistant to the concept, but the reasoned arguments presented sparked curiosity. While I haven't adopted a new perspective on the issue fully,  the experience expanded my intellectual horizons slightly.","My low conscientiousness score means I tend not to set or follow goals with sustained effort. The essay shows this in my procrastination, as I write about a task while avoiding it. While I might aspire to certain things, consistent effort isn't my strength.  I manage time haphazardly, focusing on immediate gratification rather than long-term planning. Challenges often lead to avoidance rather than strategic problem-solving.","The essay reflects my high extraversion score through my enjoyment of social interactions with roommates and friends.  A fulfilling social experience would be a lively conversation with friends, where we share laughter, jokes, and connect on a personal level. I thrive on interactions that involve sharing emotions and having some commonality and connection.  Conversely, isolating myself for extended periods leaves me feeling drained and restless.","As shown by my high agreeableness score, I handle disagreements by prioritizing harmony.  In the essay, I demonstrate empathy toward my roommate's computer issues and avoid causing further conflict. I would aim for a compromise or find a solution that accommodates everyone's needs, even if it means compromising my own preferences somewhat. Direct confrontation is something I try to avoid.","My high neuroticism score explains my tendency towards anxiety and stress.  The essay details some of these anxieties such as frustration with my dorm's internet, my concerns about my roommate and even hunger. I seem to manage these feelings by expressing them through writing, though this isn't always the most effective strategy. My initial response to stress often involves emotional reactivity and worry, which I may then try to soothe with distractions or simple pleasures, like the screen mate program.",n,n,y,y,y

Writing this paper three times, despite the setbacks, is a testament to that—each attempt felt different, forcing me to approach the task in new ways.

Ultimately, I'm driven by a desire to try new things and learn from my experiences, even if those experiences involve a lot of rewriting and technical difficulties.","I'm quite organized and determined when it comes to achieving my goals.  This paper, for example, required significant time management and persistence. I've established a structured writing process, and even though the first two attempts failed, I remained focused on completing the assignment.

Social situations, especially large gatherings, can leave me feeling drained. I prefer more intimate interactions with a few close friends or family. While observing a couple walking their dog might spark a pleasant thought, I quickly shift my focus to personal aspirations. My preference for solitude reflects my need for time to process my thoughts and emotions without external stimulation.","I generally try to be understanding and accommodating in disagreements. I'd focus on understanding their perspective before expressing my own, prioritizing respectful communication. The essay's description of my thought process shows I tend to thoughtfully consider different ideas, even if those ideas shift rapidly. However, my primary priority is to effectively express my thoughts and ideas, even if that results in frequent changes of subject and direction.","I'm prone to self-doubt and worry. The setbacks with this paper have been quite stressful.  My initial response to the frustration was to feel overwhelmed and discouraged, but I channeled these feelings into creating a more organized writing plan for the final attempt. The act of writing, despite the difficulties, serves as a healthy distraction from my worries and insecurities.",y,y,n,y,n

This systematic approach has taught me valuable time management skills.","Going home to Houston to visit my family is always energizing.  Being around loved ones, sharing meals, and just relaxing in a familiar environment fills my emotional tank. Conversely, large, boisterous parties often leave me feeling drained. I've realized I value deeper connections over superficial interactions.","In a group project, I encountered a classmate with significantly different work habits.

I’ve always been fairly grounded and focused on the things I already know and enjoy.","Balancing a full course load while maintaining my friendships and enjoying my new life in Austin has required a lot of planning. I use a planner to keep track of assignments and deadlines, and I prioritize tasks to ensure everything gets done.  I'm pretty organized and goal-oriented—I like having a plan and sticking to it. The challenge has been the occasional need for flexibility, but I've learned to adapt as needed. It's rewarding to see my academic progress and maintain my social life.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I much prefer the company of close friends in small, intimate settings. My friends' visit during Labor Day weekend was energizing because it was a small group of people I am close with, and we were in the comfort of my apartment.

It taught me the importance of setting boundaries and choosing social engagements that align with my need for solitude.,"Disagreements with my family over my computer situation, I tried explaining my needs calmly.  My priority wasn't winning the argument but ensuring I could continue my education. I communicated clearly and respectfully, but sometimes my frustration came out through my tone of voice.","The computer problems and associated family drama definitely caused anxiety. My initial response was frustration, but I tried to approach the situation constructively by seeking help from my uncle.  While I was stressed, I also used music as an outlet; listening to Schindler’s List helped me to calm down.",y,y,y,y,y
1425,"Trying something new isn't really my style. I prefer sticking to what I know and understand.  The HOSA meeting was an exception, only because a friend encouraged me to go and it seemed like there might be a business angle.  Honestly, I felt a bit out of my element the whole time; it wasn't exactly unpleasant, but it wasn't something I'd rush to repeat.","I'm not the most organized person.  Setting and achieving goals takes a lot of effort for me.  I rarely plan things out far in advance; instead I deal with things as they come, which isn’t necessarily a positive. However, sticking with something for the long haul is challenging for me.","The HOSA meeting was a draining experience, to be honest.  Interacting with a large group of strangers made me feel overwhelmed and anxious.  I think it’s the sheer number of people.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings. The experience reinforced my preference for smaller groups; I feel more comfortable and relaxed in those kinds of situations.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out, but they do happen. When confronted with a differing opinion, I tend to avoid direct conflict.  I'll try to find common ground and reach a compromise, prioritizing maintaining the relationship over winning the argument.","I get stressed and anxious easily, especially in social situations.  My initial response is often to withdraw or shut down. My current strategy is to try and be more involved in student activities to improve my confidence around people.  However, it’s a slow, gradual process, and there are setbacks.",n,n,n,n,y
1426,"Moving to a new city, Austin, was a completely new experience. The sheer volume of new faces, places, and social situations was overwhelming, but exciting.  The motivation was the chance at a fresh start and the allure of university life. Though initially stressful, I found myself growing more adaptable and open to different ways of thinking as I navigated this new environment.","Balancing academics, social life, and personal goals has been a huge challenge.  Time management is definitely not my strong suit. I’ve found that setting smaller, more manageable goals is better than trying to accomplish everything at once.  However, staying on track remains a constant struggle, and I often find myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks. The reward is the feeling of progress when I do manage to achieve something, although that feeling is often fleeting.","Meeting new people is both energizing and draining.  The fraternity and meeting girls are exciting, building social connections is good.  However, the sheer number of social interactions, coupled with attempting to remember everyone’s names is draining. I crave alone time to recharge, indicating I’m probably more introverted than I initially thought.","Disagreements are common in a large group setting. When in conflict, I tend to avoid direct confrontation and prioritize maintaining the overall harmony of the group, even if it means compromising my own opinions. It makes it hard to actually work through disagreements sometimes.","My emotional state is a rollercoaster. The move, academics, and social pressures have created a high level of stress and anxiety. My initial response is often avoidance, procrastinating on schoolwork.  I do try to manage my emotions by participating in social activities and looking forward to events like the Texas-OU game. But it's a constant battle.",y,n,n,n,y
1427,"I've never been one for wild adventures, but last summer, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I was drawn to the idea of creating something tangible with my hands, something different from my usual routine.  It was surprisingly relaxing and rewarding, and I even ended up making a vase I'm quite proud of.  It was a nice break from my usual anxieties.","I’m not known for my organizational skills.  Maintaining a relationship while juggling college is a challenge, and it often feels like a constant struggle to balance my responsibilities. I frequently find myself putting things off, though I tell myself I’ll do better next time. Trying to balance my relationship with my academic life can be a huge struggle, as I’m not naturally adept at planning or prioritization.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with people on a deeper level.  Being around a lot of people at once makes me feel self-conscious and overstimulated, and I often end up feeling overwhelmed and wanting to withdraw.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I usually avoid confrontation. In arguments with Jason, I prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising my own feelings or needs.  This isn't always healthy, and I often find myself bottling up my frustrations.","I struggle with anxiety and insecurity, particularly in my relationship.  I tend to overthink and worry, frequently second-guessing myself and my feelings.  When overwhelmed, I often isolate myself, and then I get even more anxious about isolating myself. I often spiral into negative thoughts which I have trouble pulling myself out of.",y,n,y,n,y
1428,"I wouldn't say I've done anything *completely* new, but moving to Austin for college has been a huge change.  It forced me to become more independent, like fixing my own computer, something I never would have done before. While initially daunting,  the experience of self-reliance has been surprisingly liberating.","I haven't really set any long-term goals, to be honest. College hasn't been as demanding as I expected, and I haven't needed any specific time management strategies yet.  The lack of structure is both freeing and slightly concerning. Maybe I should be more proactive.","Going out with friends every night has been energizing, mostly because I love being around people and socializing.  It's a lot of fun and definitely reflects my social needs; however, I can see how my roommate might feel left out, and I am trying to include her more. It's a learning curve in how to manage my social needs without alienating others.","The disagreement with my roommate about my late nights is something I need to work on.  My priority is to be respectful of her needs and find a compromise; while I enjoy going out, her feelings are important too.  I guess I need to improve on considering others' perspectives.","Breaking up with my boyfriend of four years was really tough; I missed him terribly.  I wasn't particularly anxious, more sad and reflective. Focusing on my new life in Austin and spending time with friends helped me process my emotions.  I felt more in control as time passed.",n,n,y,n,n
1429,Trying new things isn't really my style.  I prefer familiarity and comfort.  The thought of stepping outside my routine fills me with anxiety. Even the idea of a new hobby seems overwhelming right now.,"I struggle with sticking to long-term goals.  My focus is often scattered, and I find it hard to prioritize tasks effectively. The pressure to succeed just adds to my stress, making it even harder to stay organized and committed.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling completely drained. I crave intimacy with a small group of close friends, but even then, maintaining those relationships is difficult when I'm feeling overwhelmed by my own emotions. The sorority, for example, was initially appealing, but I found it overly competitive and draining.","Disagreements are uncomfortable for me to navigate. I tend to avoid confrontation and prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own feelings. The snobbery in my sorority is a prime example; I tolerate it rather than creating conflict.","I'm a very anxious person, and being away from home has amplified my feelings of stress.  My initial reaction to stress is often overwhelming sadness and a sense of being overwhelmed.  I wish I had better coping mechanisms, but right now I'm just trying to survive.",n,n,y,n,y
1430,"I'm drawn to spontaneity and new experiences.  While I haven't pursued many unconventional activities lately, my desire to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting demonstrates a willingness to drastically change my environment and pursue a big, uncertain goal.  Even the unexpected bus ride through a different part of Austin sparked my curiosity and interest in observing diverse perspectives. The essay reflects this openness to different ideas and paths.","I'm not particularly driven by rigid planning. My goals, like moving to L.A., are big-picture aspirations rather than meticulously charted plans.  While I'm working towards saving money for the move by working at a pool hall, my approach is more opportunistic and less structured. This aligns with the low conscientiousness score. The essay demonstrates a lack of detailed, step-by-step planning.","I enjoy social interaction, but my energy levels are highly dependent on the context.  Meeting new people is a desire, but my preference is for smaller, more intimate gatherings or situations where I can have meaningful conversations. My experience at my relatively homogenous high school and college has made making new friends more challenging, so my preference is not overtly extraverted but still social.","I have strong opinions and am not always eager to compromise.  Growing up in a dysfunctional family and then attending a very affluent high school exposed me to a wide range of viewpoints. This has sometimes created disagreement, but instead of seeking harmony, I tend to prioritize expressing my own perspective. My critical comments in the essay and descriptions of feeling like an ""outcast"" support this.","While I experience stress, particularly related to finances and future uncertainty, I tend to cope by focusing on my goals and maintaining a somewhat optimistic outlook. My desire to live independently in both New York and Los Angeles illustrates a resilience to anxiety and a willingness to take chances despite underlying stress and uncertainty. The essay details both anxiety and a relatively positive, problem-solving approach.",n,n,y,n,n
1431,"Trying something new isn't really my style.  I stick to what's familiar and comfortable, like theatre and dance, which I've done since I was little.  New experiences often feel overwhelming and stressful to me.  Even choosing my major felt like a huge risk, and I still question if I made the right decision.","Organization isn't my strong suit. My room and desk are a mess, which reflects my struggles with time management and planning. I intended to be incredibly organized in college, but that hasn't happened. The pressure to succeed and the sheer number of activities I crammed into high school left me burned out, so my current disorganization is a direct consequence of that.","Social situations usually drain me.  I've always been involved in many activities, but that was largely motivated by external pressures like college applications.  True social interaction often leaves me feeling more exhausted than fulfilled.  I find that I prefer solitary activities over large groups or busy social events.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  My natural inclination is to avoid conflict, which might come off as passive or even agreeable in the short term, but it often leads to unresolved tensions.  I tend to internalize conflicts rather than confront them directly, prioritizing maintaining peace even if it means compromising my own views.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions.  I feel overwhelmed by my college experience and second-guess my major frequently.  I respond to stress by internalizing it and becoming self-critical.  My approach to managing anxiety is mostly hoping that things improve over time, a strategy that rarely brings immediate relief.",n,n,n,n,y

The idea of creating something tangible with my own hands appealed to me, and I was curious to see if I had any natural talent for it.  The experience was surprisingly rewarding; I found a calming focus in the process, and I’m proud of the small pieces I've managed to make.","Planning my grandfather's memorial service required meticulous organization. I made detailed lists, set deadlines for different tasks, and delegated responsibilities where appropriate.  While emotional, I remained focused on creating a meaningful tribute that honored his life. The most rewarding aspect was seeing the outpouring of love and support from those who knew him.","Attending large family gatherings can be both exhilarating and exhausting. While I enjoy the connection and shared stories, the constant social interaction can be draining. I've learned to manage this by taking breaks during these events, finding quiet moments for myself to recharge. It helped me realize the importance of balancing social interaction with personal time.","I tend to value harmony and avoid conflict, but disagreements are inevitable.  Recently, a family member expressed a very different opinion from mine on how to handle my grandfather's estate, causing tension. I prioritized open communication, listened carefully to their perspective, and ultimately, we found a compromise that respected everyone's feelings.  Maintaining a respectful dialogue was key.","The death of my grandfather caused significant anxiety and sadness. Initially, I felt overwhelmed with grief and a sense of loss. To cope, I spent time with loved ones, talked about my feelings, and allowed myself to grieve in my own way. I found journaling to be a very helpful way of processing my emotions.",y,y,y,y,n
1433,"I can't even remember the last time I tried something new.  Everything feels overwhelming and stressful right now, so the idea of venturing outside my comfort zone is terrifying.  Honestly, sticking to what's familiar, even if it's unpleasant, feels safer than risking another disappointment.","Goals?  Hah. Right now, just getting through the day is a monumental task.  I haven't been able to stick to any kind of schedule or plan.  My room is a mess, my studies are neglected, and my computer is constantly malfunctioning—it's a disaster.  The challenge isn't just managing my time and resources, it's simply finding the energy to care.","Social experiences?  I barely interact with anyone here. I miss my girlfriend and my friends back home.  Even when I do interact with people, it’s draining. The lack of connection here makes me feel lonely and isolated, and any attempts at social interaction are often short-lived and unsatisfying.","Disagreements are exhausting. I tend to avoid conflict completely if possible.  If I have to deal with it, I just try to get it over with as quickly as possible without making a fuss. It’s much easier to let things go than to put in the effort of addressing the disagreement.","I'm constantly stressed and anxious.  Everything feels wrong, and I have this overwhelming sense of doom.  My initial reaction is usually anger or sadness, followed by self-blame. I end up withdrawing and wallowing in my misery, often just wishing I could go home to feel safe.",n,n,n,n,y
1434,"I enjoy exploring new music genres, especially those I find on Napster.  Discovering a song that evokes strong memories or reminds me of people and events is a really cool experience.  While I don't actively seek out radically different experiences, I'm open to trying things if they seem interesting or if they're presented to me. The ease of accessing music online is a big motivator.","I tend to procrastinate.  My calculus homework remains unfinished, and I often wait until late at night, free of distractions, to complete my assignments. This often means sacrificing sleep to get things done.  While I understand the importance of planning and time management, I struggle with applying these principles consistently.","Social interactions in my dorm are generally energizing.  I enjoy talking to people in the hallway and the lobby, and seeing what's going on. A phone call from a friend, even late at night, instantly brightens my mood and makes me feel good. Solitary activities, like studying, often leave me feeling bored and drained.","I am often eager to engage in arguments or discussions. I can get excited about debating subjects such as drugs and society. While I can understand different perspectives, my enthusiasm for debate isn't necessarily rooted in a desire for compromise or consensus.  My priority is often expressing my opinions rather than reaching a resolution.","The thought of my younger sister's potential exposure to drugs and the societal effects of substance abuse generates a significant amount of anxiety and stress. Although I initially try to distract myself with music and other activities, the worry often comes back. My response is usually focused on expressing my concerns, rather than seeking ways to manage the feeling itself.",y,n,n,n,n
1435,"I recently started reading the Bible daily, something completely new for me in terms of consistency and intention.  My motivation stemmed from a desire to reconnect with my faith and find more purpose in my life. Afterward, I feel a sense of peace and a growing hope for the future, even though I don't have all the answers yet.","A significant goal has been to strengthen my relationship with God.  I've structured my day to include daily Bible reading and prayer, prioritizing these activities.  Staying committed has been challenging at times, but the sense of purpose and peace I gain makes it worthwhile.  The most rewarding aspect is the shift in my perspective from self-focus to a desire to serve others.","Being around my family and close friends is always energizing. These interactions are fulfilling because they feel supportive and genuine, allowing me to connect on a deeper level.  Spending time with people who don't share my values or who are negative can leave me drained.  This has reinforced the importance of surrounding myself with positive influences.","I haven't described any disagreements in my essay, but I would try my best to approach any such situation with empathy and understanding.  My priority would be to listen to the other person's perspective, even if we disagree, and find common ground to foster a respectful resolution.  Maintaining a positive relationship would be paramount.","When I feel stressed, which is usually when I doubt God's plan, I initially turn to prayer and Bible reading for comfort. This helps me to calm down and gain perspective. This grounding helps me approach my situation more rationally, trusting that God will provide guidance and strength.",y,y,y,y,y
1436,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly a thrill-seeker.  The essay probably shows that. I mostly stick to what I know, but sometimes I'll try something new if it involves friends or seems like it could be fun, even if I'm secretly nervous.  For example,  I guess going to that meeting with Georgia instead of skipping it was a bit out of my comfort zone, but my friends make everything easier.","To be honest, I struggle with planning and sticking to schedules. That's pretty clear from the stream of consciousness in my essay. Goals often get sidelined by whatever seems more urgent or fun at the moment. I sometimes manage to keep up with things, but it’s mostly due to outside pressure or because someone I like is involved.  If I could choose, I'd rather be spontaneous.","I'm definitely more energized by close friends.  Hanging out with Doug and Bobby, or Sheniel, or even Lauren (despite the risk of getting sick!), sounds a lot more appealing than large parties. The essay shows how much I value those connections, and they really do revitalize me. Being around people I don't know or don't care for leaves me feeling drained and frustrated.","I can be stubborn and opinionated, so disagreements can be pretty challenging. I usually try to avoid outright conflict, but if I'm pushed too far, I’ll speak my mind, although my tone is probably more frustrated than assertive. The essay doesn't show me directly handling disagreement, but it hints at my preference for avoiding direct conflict. My priorities are to maintain the relationships that matter to me.","Stress and anxiety are a big part of my life, as the essay clearly reveals.  I tend to get overwhelmed by deadlines, academic pressure, and even small inconveniences like a malfunctioning computer or bad weather. I cope with it by complaining, distracting myself, and relying on my friends for support. Sometimes, I'll just retreat into my own world and try to ride out the negative feelings.",n,n,y,n,y

It was completely outside my usual activities, and I was motivated by a desire to try something new and creative, something different from the usual anxieties swirling in my mind. Although I'm still quite bad, the process has been surprisingly enjoyable and offers a welcome distraction.","I haven't really had a sustained, long-term goal.  My life often feels like a series of fleeting impulses. I struggle with planning and organization; commitment is not my strong suit. When I do start something, my lack of focus often gets in the way of following through. That being said, I find the instant gratification of certain pursuits, particularly the instant messaging and snacks, far more rewarding.","Large social gatherings often leave me drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, but even then, the energy required can be exhausting. The constant barrage of information and the need to constantly filter my thoughts, especially the more negative ones, are draining.  I find more fulfillment in the one-on-one setting of Instant Messaging.","I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. I don't have the energy to engage in prolonged arguments, especially when there is the inherent lack of trust I have in others. Instead of directly confronting someone, I tend to withdraw or passively agree, even if I disagree internally. This is often the path of least resistance.","When stressed, I tend to overthink and obsess over minor details. I find myself trapped in a cycle of self-criticism and negative thoughts.  My coping mechanism is often impulsive, like eating or getting lost in instant messaging. This is a temporary distraction, however, and usually does not lead to long-term solutions.",y,n,y,n,y
1438,"I'm always open to new musical experiences.  Discovering the Irish band Travis was a great example; I found their music online and was immediately captivated by their unique sound.  It broadened my musical horizons and introduced me to a genre I hadn't explored before.  Afterward, I felt energized and excited to find new artists.","My goal was to maintain strong relationships with my family despite being away at school.  I prioritized regular communication, planning visits home, and being mindful of their needs and feelings. While balancing schoolwork and a social life presented challenges, the reward of closeness to my family kept me committed.  It reinforced the importance of nurturing my relationships.","Spending time with my best friend, my mom, is always energizing. Our shared interests and ability to just ""be"" together creates a comfortable, fulfilling connection.  Conversely, large, boisterous social gatherings can leave me feeling drained;  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well. This experience confirmed my preference for meaningful, close connections over superficial socializing.",Disagreements with my father about carpool arrangements made me prioritize direct communication. I decided to clearly express my discomfort and unhappiness with the carpool.  I aimed for a compromise that respected my feelings while still being considerate of his busy schedule. I value open and honest communication for conflict resolution.,"Being away from my family caused me considerable anxiety and homesickness. My initial response was overwhelming sadness and a deep longing for home.  However, I channeled these feelings into making a plan to visit sooner rather than later. This proactive approach helped manage my emotions and eased my anxiety about missing my family.",y,y,n,y,n
1439,"I wouldn't say I actively seek out completely new experiences.  The essay shows my mind jumps around a lot, and that's more about my internal world than external exploration.  However, listening to that piano CD was a relatively new experience for me in that it brought back specific memories associated with Marie Tesi. It was pleasant, primarily because of the nostalgia, not the novelty itself.",I don't have a great track record with long-term goals. My essay reflects my difficulty focusing and sticking to something.  I can get interested in things – like psychology – but following through on a plan to achieve that takes more effort and discipline than I usually possess.  Time management is definitely not a strength of mine; I'm easily distracted.,"Most social experiences drain me.  The essay hints at this.  I prefer one-on-one interactions where I can listen more than talk, which is probably why I'm told I'm easy to talk to. Large groups or superficial interactions leave me feeling exhausted.  I value deep connections but struggle to initiate or maintain them.","I generally try to find a compromise, as the essay points out; I'm aware of the gray areas in life. If I'm in a disagreement, my priority is to understand the other person's perspective and reach a mutually acceptable solution, even if it means sacrificing some of my own desires. Direct conflict is something I tend to avoid.","I have a tendency towards anxiety, as evidenced by my insecurity around relationships and overall uncertainty about the future which is reflected in my writing. My initial response to stress is often internalized worry, but I do try to find constructive outlets.  Listening to music, for instance, helps me calm down.",n,n,n,n,y

I found the unexpected intelligence and behavior of the squirrel fascinating.  The entire experience was calming and unexpectedly enjoyable, leaving me with a sense of wonder about the natural world.","I don't typically set long-term goals, and I find sustained effort challenging. My time management is not very structured; I prefer to follow my immediate interests, which explains my spontaneous interaction with the squirrel.  I lack a rigid system for achieving goals, and I’m more easily distracted by new stimuli.","My encounter with the squirrel was a solitary social experience, but the interaction with the other people passing by, while short, did cause me to feel a sense of awkwardness.  I prefer more independent and deeply introspective pursuits.  The brief social interaction emphasized my preference for solitary observation rather than group activities.","I didn't encounter any direct conflict with anyone regarding my time with the squirrel, although some people might have judged my unusual behavior.  If I had encountered conflict, I probably would have been unconcerned with the judgements of others, and perhaps even defensive of my actions.  My priority would have been to continue my observation.","The initial stress of my day was completely alleviated by my observation of the squirrel.   I found the interaction calming and oddly therapeutic, the distraction proved to be an effective coping mechanism for managing my anxiety.",y,n,y,n,y
1441,"I've always been drawn to new experiences.  Joining my sorority was a big leap—a completely different social environment than I was used to.  Initially, I was excited by the opportunity to meet so many driven, intelligent women. Afterward, while I cherish the friendships, the required shift in my demeanor towards potential new members has been challenging.","Balancing academics, extracurriculars, work, and my sorority is a constant juggling act. I use planners and to-do lists religiously to manage my time.  While I aim for a 3.6 GPA to get into medical school, the pressure is immense. I find it rewarding to accomplish my goals, but the sheer volume of tasks often leaves me feeling overwhelmed.  The constant pressure is the biggest challenge.","Being surrounded by my sorority sisters is generally energizing; I thrive on our shared goals and camaraderie.  However, the expectation of being ""stern and forceful"" during recruitment meetings drains me. The contrast between my genuine friendships with these women and the more formal, assertive role I'm expected to play leaves me feeling conflicted and depleted.","The conflict with my sorority sisters over recruitment strategies has been difficult. My initial instinct is to maintain our friendships, but I'm learning that my approach isn't always effective.  I'm trying to find a balance between maintaining genuine relationships and fulfilling my responsibilities as a member.  My priority is to find a resolution that respects both our friendships and the sorority's requirements.","The essay reflects my current high stress levels. Feeling overwhelmed by my commitments leads to frustration and exhaustion.  I initially respond to stress by trying to do everything at once, which makes things worse. My coping mechanism is to lean on my to-do lists and try to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.  While this strategy helps, the underlying anxiety persists.",y,y,y,n,y
1442,"I'm always looking at things from a different angle than most people.  That's just how my mind works. For example, I recently decided to start learning coding, something completely outside my comfort zone.  I was motivated by a desire to challenge myself and expand my skillset, and while it's been tough, the satisfaction of solving a problem is amazing.","I'm driven to achieve my goals, which has always required discipline and organization. Getting through school, for instance, demanded careful time management and consistent study habits.  I use to-do lists and break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. Even with setbacks (like a difficult exam), I would focus on what I could control and adjust my plan.  It's been rewarding to see how far I've come.","I find large, loud social gatherings draining.  I prefer more intimate settings with close friends.  A recent dinner with a few good friends was incredibly energizing. The easy conversation and shared laughter were exactly what I needed. That experience reinforced my preference for meaningful connections over superficial ones.","I try my best to understand others' perspectives, even if I disagree.  A recent argument with a family member involved listening to their viewpoint and explaining my own feelings calmly, focusing on finding common ground. While it didn't fully resolve the issue, it helped open a path to future dialogue.","I'm often overwhelmed by stress. My initial response is often feeling trapped and anxious, like the essay reflects.  To cope, I try to pinpoint the source of my stress and break it down. Talking to someone or just writing my thoughts down really helps. It's a process of self-soothing and finding coping mechanisms that work for me.",y,y,y,y,y

Afterwards, I felt… relieved it was over, mostly.","I set a goal to finish my economics homework, but honestly,  I procrastinated.  My time management is…flexible.  I often push things off until the last minute. Challenges?  Mostly my own lack of self-discipline.  Rewarding?  The feeling of accomplishment after finally completing something (though it's rare!).",Going out with the girls is always energizing.  Sixth Street is a great place to be social.  The interaction is fulfilling because of the shared laughter and company.  I thrive in those social settings—I recharge with them; it definitely shapes how I prefer to spend my free time.,"I avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to just let it go or avoid the situation entirely unless it's essential to address it, such as with a roommate.  My priority is to maintain harmony and keep things peaceful, even if it means avoiding difficult conversations.","Being stuck in my room for a week stressed me out.  Initially, I felt restless and irritable. To manage it, I went out with my friends, which helped calm me down.  Taking a break and socializing is usually my coping mechanism.",n,y,y,n,y

The essay reflects this:  I'm focused on my immediate surroundings and worries, like the noisy phone and the cold room.  Trying something new isn't really on my mind.","I'm incredibly conscientious, always striving to meet my obligations.  The essay shows this by my concern over completing all my homework and reading, fitting in time for family and my sorority, and attending to my mother's needs. I manage my time by meticulously listing everything I must do, even if I don't know how I'll achieve it all. The challenge is the sheer volume of responsibilities; I find the rewarding aspect in fulfilling my commitments, even if it makes me anxious.","Social interactions are important to me but also exhausting. The essay shows this through my desire to see my mom and sorority sisters, but also my apprehension about the demands on my time and energy from others.  Fulfilling interactions leave me energized, but too many leave me drained, highlighting the need for balance in my social life.","I struggle with conflict and prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own feelings. My essay displays this by my concern over hurting my family's feelings, and even showing a conflicted and guilt-ridden approach to my resentment towards others.  While I don't like conflict, I still harbor resentment; I try to resolve things by avoiding confrontation or direct disagreement.","I'm highly neurotic and easily stressed. The essay reflects this through my continuous worries about everything—academics, family, friends, my physical health, and even the well-being of those I dislike. My initial response to stress is worry and anxiety; I manage this by focusing on my tasks to prove my worth and relieve that anxiety, though this cycle leads to more stress in the long run.",n,y,y,n,y

I was motivated by the desire for a fresh start and new experiences, and while the adjustment to being alone a lot has been challenging, I’m finding that meeting new people makes it worthwhile. Overall, the experience has been positive and has broadened my horizons.","Managing my schoolwork has always been important to me.  I'm used to structured environments and regular progress reports, so the university’s system of one final grade at the end of the semester is slightly unnerving. I've tried to develop a good schedule and focus on staying organized, setting smaller goals to break down the larger task of preparing for finals. It can still feel overwhelming, but I'm trying to be disciplined about my time management.","I generally prefer smaller, intimate social gatherings. Large social events or situations where I don't know many people often drain me.  The death of my friends has made me appreciate the importance of close connections.  Spending time with my few close friends is where I feel energized and supported.  Large social situations can feel overwhelming and lonely, highlighting my introverted nature.","I tend to avoid conflict,  but I'm also not afraid to express my opinions when necessary. With the recent deaths of several close friends, there are disagreements, mostly unspoken ones, and those involve questions like ""why?"" I've learned to prioritize empathy and understanding in resolving disputes. My focus is on communication, listening to others' perspectives, and finding common ground even if we don't agree.","The recent deaths of friends have been incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking.  Initially, I reacted with overwhelming sadness and tears. To cope, I turned to writing, finding it therapeutic to process my emotions. It's a method of managing my feelings, even though the stress and anxiety related to the situation might continue for a long time.  Though I’m anxious about finals, writing has become a valuable tool in dealing with stress.",y,y,n,y,n
1446,"The essay reveals a willingness to explore different avenues of expression, like stream-of-consciousness writing, even if it feels unconventional.  While there's a self-doubt expressed about the quality of the writing, the act itself indicates a certain openness to unconventional modes of self-expression. The inherent uncertainty and vulnerability in the piece suggests a capacity for exploring unfamiliar emotional territories.","The essay lacks evidence of a strong focus on planning or goal-setting. Instead, it reflects a more impulsive and spontaneous writing style, seemingly prioritizing immediate expression over meticulous structure. The writer mentions wanting to go to bed early but fails to do so, which demonstrates a lack of self-discipline and adherence to plans.  There's no discussion of methods for achieving long-term goals.","The writer's longing for social connection, particularly within a peer group, coupled with feelings of exclusion and inadequacy, strongly suggests introversion. The overwhelming focus on social anxieties and perceived rejection indicates that social interactions, at least with certain groups, are draining rather than energizing. The desire to be included suggests a yearning for social connection, yet the narrative demonstrates a difficulty in achieving this.","The essay reveals a tendency toward self-criticism and negativity, particularly when reflecting on past social interactions. There's a considerable degree of self-blame and a perceived inability to ""fit in,"" suggesting a less agreeable personality. The writer's self-assessment indicates a perceived inability to navigate social conflicts and a struggle to find common ground, highlighting a lack of assertiveness.","The pervasive anxiety, self-doubt, and feelings of inadequacy evident throughout the essay are strong indicators of high neuroticism. The writer's concerns about meeting expectations, worries about the quality of their writing, and the recurring theme of social anxieties all reflect a heightened sensitivity to stress and a propensity for negative self-evaluation. The overwhelming feeling of tiredness further illustrates a high level of emotional distress.",y,n,n,n,y
1447,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives, even if they challenge my own beliefs.  My recent foray into deeper philosophical discussions about religion, stemming from a disagreement with a colleague, exemplifies this. While I found the experience frustrating at times, it reinforced my commitment to critical thinking and open-mindedness. The encounter strengthened my resolve to engage with diverse viewpoints, even those that seem illogical to me.","I am generally a highly organized and detail-oriented person. While I don't explicitly detail my strategies in my writing, my essay itself is an example of my conscientiousness. I carefully articulated my thoughts and points, organizing them to create a cohesive argument; a level of thoughtfulness and organization that demonstrates my commitment to presenting my arguments in a clear and logical manner. This aligns with my dedication to rational thought and intellectual pursuit.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining. I find one-on-one conversations stimulating, especially when they involve intellectual debate. But large group settings or superficial interactions tend to leave me feeling drained.  My essay showcases my inclination towards introspective thought, suggesting a preference for smaller, more meaningful interactions rather than large, loud, or shallow social events. I’m much more comfortable engaging in deep philosophical discussion with an individual rather than a large group dynamic.","I can be quite assertive when it comes to defending my beliefs and challenging what I perceive as irrationality. The disagreement with my coworker illustrates this—I actively presented counterarguments and questioned his faith-based reasoning. While this demonstrates a lack of agreeableness according to the Big 5, my approach prioritized intellectual honesty and reason, although my approach lacked tact. My goal wasn't necessarily to win the argument but to encourage critical thinking and address what I saw as fundamental flaws in his worldview. I’m not necessarily interested in being agreeable for agreeableness' sake.","I tend to experience intense emotions, particularly frustration and anger, when confronted with what I consider to be illogical or morally questionable behavior. My response to my coworker's religious beliefs and to societal biases against homosexuals, as detailed in my essay, demonstrates this. However, I channel these emotions by engaging in critical analysis and writing.  The act of writing allows me to process these feelings and transform them into productive intellectual exploration. My neuroticism, however, is very much evident in my words and my frustration at the perceived ignorance in the world around me.",y,y,n,n,n
1448,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  Getting a tattoo on Sixth Street during orientation was probably the closest I’ve come to stepping outside my comfort zone. Even then, it was with a friend, and the whole experience felt more about fitting in than genuine exploration.  I prefer familiarity and things I already know I like.","I'm not the most organized person.  Setting goals and sticking to them isn't really my strong suit. I get overwhelmed easily, as shown by my reaction to the bad Labor Day weekend. I didn't have any effective strategies for managing my time and staying on track; instead, going home provided a temporary escape from the pressures of college life.","Social situations generally leave me feeling drained.  The brief mentions of friends taking me to Sixth Street and my roommate's attempts to cheer me up reveal my preference for smaller, intimate interactions rather than large social gatherings.  My overall reaction to college life and the struggles I've described highlight my need for more quiet time and less social pressure.",Disagreements are uncomfortable for me.  I haven't really had major conflicts mentioned in my essay. My focus would likely be on avoiding confrontation and maintaining harmony rather than actively resolving the disagreement.  The essay shows I’m easily frustrated and tend to react strongly to negative experiences.,"I tend to overreact to stressful situations.  The Labor Day weekend was a perfect example of this. Minor inconveniences quickly escalated into a major crisis in my mind, leading to feelings of homesickness and disillusionment.  My initial response to stress is often emotional and negative, but the essay hints that spending time with loved ones and making plans (joining a sorority) helps me cope.",n,n,n,n,y
1449,"I recently started taking intermediate racquetball.  Initially, I was motivated by a desire to improve my physical fitness and meet people. I found the experience challenging but rewarding; learning new skills is exciting, even if it means some awkward moments at first.  The improvement I've seen in my ability to do pull-ups, from none to two, is a major accomplishment for me.","I set a goal to improve my physical fitness.  To stay on track, I scheduled regular racquetball sessions and incorporated daily workouts. I found maintaining this commitment challenging at times, but using a workout buddy and tracking my progress helped me stay motivated.  The rewarding part was reaching milestones, such as being able to do two pull-ups.","Meeting Maggie was a memorable social experience that left me feeling a mix of energized and drained.  Our shared interest in anime initially energized me.  The draining part was realizing my feelings weren't reciprocated, making me question my social abilities and how I communicate.  I need to work on expressing myself more clearly.","I've had several disagreements lately, particularly regarding my feelings for other girls. In these situations, my priority has been understanding the other person's perspective, even if it meant accepting that my feelings aren't returned. I've tried to communicate openly and respectfully, even though it can be difficult.  Sometimes people just don't see things my way, and that's okay.","When Maggie revealed her feelings weren't romantic, I felt stressed and anxious. My initial response was disappointment and self-doubt. To manage these feelings, I turned to my friends for support and tried to focus on self-improvement—through exercise, for example.  This helped me to feel more in control.",y,y,y,y,n
1450,"I enjoy trying new things, although I am somewhat spontaneous about it.  My decision to possibly visit my friends at Baylor this weekend, even with a busy schedule, shows this.  The essay reflects an openness to social experiences and new places.  While I haven’t explicitly described trying a completely *new* activity, the overall openness to various social and academic activities suggests a willingness to explore different aspects of life.","I struggle with planning and time management, as evident in my rambling thoughts about the weekend and my numerous unfinished tasks (new ID, reading, working on a song, etc.).  My essay reveals a lack of structured approach to goal setting.  While I *want* to achieve things, I don't systematically organize my time and resources to accomplish them.  The essay shows that I may set goals (like working out) but lack the discipline to follow through reliably.",I appear to be extraverted; I enjoy social interaction and spend time considering how to best see my friends.  The essay is filled with names of friends and plans involving them.  Being around friends seems energizing; my indecisiveness about the weekend stems from wanting to balance social time with other responsibilities.,"I don’t explicitly mention conflict in the essay.  However, the casual way I discuss my social interactions and lack of deep engagement with potential romantic conflicts shows a somewhat indifferent attitude towards resolving conflict.  My prioritization of my own plans and desires suggests that I'm not always highly agreeable; pleasing others isn't my highest priority.","The essay does not directly display high levels of stress or anxiety.  While I mention feeling tired, my overall tone is one of casual indecision rather than intense worry or emotional turmoil. My many plans and shifting priorities suggest a lack of worry about being unprepared or disorganized.",y,n,y,n,n
1451,"I've always been drawn to the beauty in the mundane—things like sunsets and shadows hold a special appeal to me.  Recently, I started learning to play the guitar, something completely outside my usual routine.  The motivation was a desire to express myself creatively and connect with something deeper than my everyday anxieties.  While it's still early days, I find it quite fulfilling.","I'm not really one for long-term planning or rigidly sticking to schedules. My goals tend to be more fluid and driven by immediate inspiration.  The idea of sustained effort feels daunting and often leads to procrastination.  Achieving anything of significance requires a significant burst of motivation, usually triggered by some sort of emotional upheaval. The idea of a structured path to a goal is not something I personally find particularly rewarding.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  I find a sense of fulfillment in quiet moments of shared understanding, like listening to music with someone who appreciates it as much as I do.  The ""noisy"" social events of college life have reaffirmed my preference for solitude and meaningful connections over superficial interactions.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid, but when unavoidable, I'll try to listen and understand the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it. My priority is to maintain a sense of peace and mutual respect, even if it means compromising or letting the issue slide.  Direct confrontation is not my strong suit.","Stress and anxiety manifest in procrastination and a tendency to retreat into myself. My initial response to overwhelming situations is often avoidance. However, I'm learning to manage it by turning to activities that calm me down, like listening to music or spending time in nature.  These methods help me regain perspective and approach challenges more constructively, even if not always directly.",y,n,n,n,n
1452,"I rarely try new things.  The idea of stepping outside my comfort zone fills me with apprehension. The essay reflects this; the idea of embracing change is presented, but my inherent resistance to it is evident.  Novelty feels threatening, and I prefer the familiar and predictable.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My essay emphasizes the pitfalls of clinging to expectations and routines, suggesting a lack of structured planning and consistent effort. I find the process of sustained effort challenging, and often abandon projects before completion.",Social interactions usually drain me.  Large gatherings leave me feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. My introverted nature is reflected in the essay's emphasis on introspection and detachment.  I prefer solitude and find deep connections with others difficult to maintain.,"Disagreements are difficult and I often avoid direct confrontation. My natural inclination is to retreat from conflict, prioritizing avoidance over resolution. The essay's focus on inner peace and detachment suggests a preference for minimizing conflict to protect my own emotional state.","I experience high levels of stress and anxiety frequently.  These feelings are a dominant aspect of my internal experience.

The lake trips with Courtney are fun, but they're a regular part of our routine.  New experiences tend to make me a little anxious, which is why overcoming my fear of public speaking is such a big deal for me.","I'm not naturally super organized or driven.  Getting ready for college involved some planning— choosing classes, making sure I was enrolled – but I didn't meticulously map out my entire academic career or anything.  I tend to handle things as they come up. Overcoming my speech anxiety has been a long-term goal, and progress has been slow but steady.  The reward is feeling more confident.","Large social gatherings drain me.  Being with Courtney, my close friend, however, energizes me.  It’s the intimacy and familiarity that makes the difference. The prospect of having to interact with many unknown people in my future career as a nurse does fill me with some apprehension. I prefer one-on-one interactions.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I try to avoid conflict whenever possible.  I'm not one to argue or push my opinions aggressively. In disagreements, I'd rather find common ground and maintain harmony. Trying to make others happy often takes priority over asserting my own perspectives directly.","Public speaking makes me incredibly anxious and stressed.  My initial response is usually physical—shaking, sweating, racing heart.

I found the experience relaxing and surprisingly enjoyable, even though I'm not sure I'd call myself a natural artist.  It showed me that I'm capable of trying new things.","I'm not known for my meticulous planning or unwavering dedication to long-term goals.  While I might have good intentions, maintaining focus and sticking to a schedule is a constant struggle.  Even if I'm genuinely interested in completing something, outside distractions—such as my roommate's conversations or the television—easily divert my attention. It can be really challenging for me to balance my tasks and stay organized.","I'm energized by engaging in social interactions with my close friends and having meaningful conversations. It's in these scenarios that I feel most comfortable and outgoing.  However, large, noisy gatherings or shallow conversations tend to exhaust me. I find myself easily distracted from the core of the interaction which leads to my feeling drained.  I need quiet time to recharge after social interactions.","I generally strive to maintain harmony in my relationships, and I'm often willing to compromise to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I typically try to approach the situation calmly and listen to the other person's perspective.  My main priority is understanding their point of view even if I don't agree with it entirely. While I might prefer to avoid confrontation, I'll speak up if necessary to be honest and clear.","I get anxious easily, and my anxiety makes it difficult to concentrate on my tasks and goals. When overwhelmed, I tend to become impatient and frustrated, with time seeming to slow down. I cope by attempting to distract myself; sometimes this involves focusing on external stimuli like television or even letting myself be distracted by random thoughts. I do have difficulty with emotional regulation, and often find my reaction disproportionate to the actual situation.",y,n,y,y,n

I'd always been more of a solitary person, preferring books to sports, but I figured it was time to try something completely outside my comfort zone.

It felt exhilarating to learn a new skill and be part of something bigger than myself.","My goal was to maintain a healthy weight throughout my first semester of college, defying the ""freshman fifteen."" I meticulously tracked my food intake, paying close attention to fat grams listed on cafeteria menus, and incorporated a rigorous walking and gym routine into my daily schedule. Even when I had late-night study sessions or social events, I prioritized sticking to my plan.  The challenge was balancing my social life with my fitness goals, but the rewarding part was seeing tangible results and proving to myself that I could achieve something I'd set my mind to.","A crowded weight room, surprisingly, energized me.  Everyone was focused and pushing themselves, creating an atmosphere of shared purpose and accomplishment.  The collaborative, if somewhat competitive, energy was motivating. I realized I appreciate social interactions that involve shared goals and a palpable sense of drive. Conversely, small talk and superficial interactions tend to drain me, which explains my preference for intense but shared physical activities.","I haven’t really had a major disagreement with anyone yet. I feel like the small conflicts I encounter are handled by focusing on compromise and communication. If someone disagrees with my views on the ""freshman fifteen,"" I politely acknowledge their concerns while reaffirming my fitness goals. Because this issue is mostly about me I don't usually feel the need to take the high road. The important thing is to avoid conflict when possible, and I'm very focused on that right now.","When I think about potential weight gain and all the possible ways that could happen, it makes me really anxious. My initial response is to become very driven to avoid the weight gain, planning every aspect of my daily routine to stay on top of the situation. The resulting discipline helps to calm my anxiety, as I feel more in control and less likely to fail.

However,  taking Mr. Hammerhesh's economics class—with its hundreds of students—was definitely outside my comfort zone.  While initially apprehensive, the sheer scale of it was oddly captivating.  I didn't find it particularly enriching in a deep, intellectual sense, but it was memorable.","I'm not known for meticulous planning or unwavering dedication to long-term goals.  Balancing my college classes, social life, and extracurriculars feels more like navigating a whirlwind than following a strict schedule.  I tend to react to immediate demands rather than proactively managing my time, which often leads to last-minute rushes.  It's a chaotic, but somehow enjoyable, approach.","Being surrounded by hundreds of people in my economics class was definitely energizing in a strange, almost chaotic way.  The shared experience of being crammed together in a lecture hall fostered a sense of collective energy that I found exhilarating.  I thrive in large social settings where there’s a shared activity or focus. Smaller, more intimate gatherings tend to drain me.","I generally avoid conflict. In disagreements, my priority is to maintain harmony.  I'd rather find common ground or simply agree to disagree than engage in a contentious argument. I value positive relationships above all else, and I think that is reflected in my preference for resolving conflicts peacefully.","I don't often experience crippling stress or anxiety.

I use a planner and to-do lists to manage my time, and I prioritize tasks based on deadlines.  While sometimes I fall behind, I generally manage to stay on top of things.

Afterwards, I felt entertained and relaxed; it was a welcome distraction from my worries about school and my campers.","I struggle with maintaining long-term goals.  Setting aside time to study for Spanish has been a persistent challenge. My attempts at effective time management are often unsuccessful, leading to poor grades.  While I recognize the importance of studying, my tendency to get distracted by other things, like funny movies and interactions with friends, makes it hard to stay committed.","I'm energized by being around my friends. Homecoming is something I'm really looking forward to.  The energy of being with my friends is incredibly fulfilling. Conversely, extended periods of solitude, like when focused on studying, can leave me feeling drained.  I crave social interaction to recharge, but I also realize this can be a detriment sometimes when studying for school.","I'm often lighthearted with Tatiana, even jokingly insulting her. Although I appreciate the humor and connection this creates, it doesn't necessarily allow for deep conversations about serious topics. Perhaps we need to make a conscious effort to set aside time for a more meaningful discussion.","I feel stressed when I'm not doing well in Spanish class or when I'm worried about how my campers are doing.

I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with a few people on a deeper level, rather than making small talk with a large group.  The Counting Crows concert is an exception; I find solace in the shared experience of listening to music with others who appreciate it, even if it's a large crowd.","I generally try to be agreeable, but there are limits. When my roommate dismisses my religious beliefs,  I try to understand her perspective, attributing it to ignorance. However, I'm not afraid to address disagreements, even if it means stating my views.  Maintaining a respectful dialogue is important to me, even if there is a conflict of opinions.","I tend to be prone to anxiety and stress.  The pressures of college, and the constant need to maintain communication with my parents, create a great deal of tension. I manage this by listening to music, which I find emotionally cathartic, even if the tears streaming down my face are somewhat embarrassing. I suppose this behavior is unhealthy, but it's my coping mechanism.",y,n,y,y,y

While I'm open to love, I'm not one for impulsive, wildly different paths.","I'm highly organized and dedicated to my goals, particularly my education.  I've planned my life carefully and am committed to achieving my academic ambitions.  The essay reveals my dedication to my studies and my reluctance to compromise them, even for the relationship.  Balancing my studies and relationship is a constant challenge, but staying on track is a priority.","I am a very loving and affectionate person, but I am not an extrovert.  My ideal social situation is a close, intimate connection with someone I trust, like my boyfriend. Large social gatherings drain me. I value deep connections over superficial interactions. My essay illustrates my strong feelings for my boyfriend and my need for closeness within my relationship, emphasizing quality over quantity in my relationships.","I value harmony in my relationships and strive to avoid conflict.  I try to understand others' perspectives even when disagreeing, as evidenced by my worry about hurting my boyfriend's feelings.  In my essay, I express concern for others' feelings and dislike of selfishness.","I can be anxious, particularly about the uncertainty of my long-distance relationship.

1467,"I'm driven by a deep desire to create and experience new things.  Moving miles away from my starting point was a huge step, a completely new environment and way of life.  This move was motivated by a need to find myself and to create, not just exist.  The experience has been both exhilarating and challenging, but overall, it has fueled my creative fire.","My current project, collaborating with a companion to create media, requires immense sustained effort. I focus on consistent, though not necessarily rigidly scheduled, work to manage my time, prioritizing periods of intense focus. The challenge lies in balancing this focus with the need to feed my body and soul; the reward is the tangible creation of something I believe has value.","I find social interaction draining.  While I appreciate my companion's collaboration, even that can sometimes feel overwhelming.  My preference leans towards solitary work and introspection, allowing the creative flow to guide me.  I value my alone time; it is during these periods where my best work is done.","Disagreements are rare for me, but if one were to happen, I’d likely prioritize understanding the other person's perspective before attempting resolution.  Collaboration is crucial to my creative process, so I find that compromise and finding common ground are vital to maintain positive working relationships.  Conflict avoidance is a priority, even if it sometimes means prioritizing my companion's ideas.","Stress and anxiety are managed by focusing on the creative process.  Immersion in work allows me to channel negative energy into positive creation.  Rather than initially reacting to stress, I use it as fuel, pushing through to the other side. This is the strategy that works best for me.",y,y,n,y,n

I guess trying to navigate campus without getting lost on ""the loop"" was a bit of a challenge, but not something that dramatically changed my perspective.","I'm trying to stay on top of my classes and coursework, though it’s a work in progress.  I haven't really developed any specific time management strategies yet, more just trying to keep up with assignments as they come. I'm challenged by the sheer amount of new information and the need to adapt to a new environment, but the rewarding part is learning new things and having fun with my friends.","Spending time with my suitemates is usually energizing, since they have cars and take me places.  However, large social gatherings can be draining. I prefer smaller groups of close friends, and prefer quieter activities over big, loud parties.  Being around people I enjoy spending time with makes me happy and energized.","I try to avoid conflict, I don't really enjoy confrontation. If I disagree with someone, I tend to just keep my opinion to myself unless it's really important. My priority is maintaining positive relationships rather than forcing my views on others, even if it means compromising on my own opinions.","Getting lost on campus would really stress me out, so I avoid ""the loop.""

I manage my time by scheduling workouts after completing assignments and before other activities like reading.  Sticking to this requires discipline, and I find it challenging to balance studying and exercise, but the reward of feeling better is motivating.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I'm more comfortable with smaller groups or one-on-one interactions, like my brief encounter with Tanya. I prefer the familiarity and comfort of my close friends and family in Dallas over the large and unfamiliar student population here.","Disagreements with my girlfriend Brandi are difficult.  My priority is avoiding hurting her feelings, even if it means not being entirely honest about my feelings.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation, leading to a sense of being trapped in a relationship that may not be right for me.","I experience significant anxiety about my classes, particularly calculus, and upcoming tests.

Moving to UT Austin was a huge leap from my familiar Houston life, and while initially daunting with massive buildings and unfamiliar faces, it ended up being incredibly rewarding. The new environment and the chance to meet new people energized me and broadened my perspective. It confirmed my openness to new situations.","I'm not naturally organized; my rushing to class late one day proves that.  While I value journaling as a form of self-expression and stress relief, I don't usually plan extensively. My approach is more reactive than proactive.  I tend to handle things as they come and prioritize immediate needs over long-term planning.  This sometimes leads to problems but it works for me most of the time.","I thrive in social situations; interacting with friends, both old and new, is incredibly energizing.  The support of my friends helps me navigate new challenges, like adjusting to college life.   I enjoy striking up conversations with strangers. Conversely, dealing with someone I wasn't sure I liked was more stressful because of the expectations they placed on me.","I'm not always good at directly confronting disagreements. When a friend expressed strong feelings for me, I felt pressure and avoided a direct confrontation, choosing instead to write about my feelings in my diary. It's easier for me to process and deal with conflict privately rather than directly. I value maintaining relationships, even if it means prioritizing my own emotional comfort.","I tend to experience stress, but I have healthy coping mechanisms. The late arrival to class and the overwhelming feeling of being surrounded by people caused initial anxiety. However, I processed these feelings in my diary and found that sharing my experiences with friends helped a great deal. Humor and social interaction help me to alleviate stress rather than dwelling on it.",y,n,y,n,n

The only ""new"" thing I recently did was finally beat the game, which felt more like relief than excitement. It wasn't a conscious decision to try something new so much as a natural progression within my existing routine.","My goal was to beat Virtua Tennis.  Time management wasn't exactly a strong suit during that period; hours melted away. My strategy was simply to keep playing until I won, ignoring other obligations.  I didn’t manage my resources or time well at all, which is why I feel I needed to stop. The rewarding part was the final victory, but it was overshadowed by the negative consequences.","Playing Virtua Tennis with my roommates was energizing.  The shared focus, the competition, and the late-night camaraderie fueled me.  It was social interaction that felt positive and satisfying, and I thrive when I'm deeply engaged with others in a shared activity.  I realize I need that social engagement, but it can't consume all of my time and energy.","I haven't really had any major disagreements recently, except maybe with myself about my video game habit. I'm not generally conflict-avoidant, but my internal conflict over the game led me to finally put it aside for the sake of my academic responsibilities.  My priority was to overcome this addiction.","When I was deeply engrossed in Virtua Tennis, my stress levels were surprisingly low while playing. It was an escape. The anxiety and stress came later, when I realized the consequences of my gaming habit and how it was impacting my schoolwork.  The first step to managing this was to consciously pull myself away from the game, and the next was to focus my attention on my studies and academic goals.",n,n,y,n,n

I'm hoping to try some new clubs or activities eventually, though!","Getting into UT was a huge goal, requiring years of hard work and dedication.  I meticulously planned my classes and managed my time effectively in high school to maintain high grades. That structured approach is what helped me stay on track. However, now, college feels less structured, and I'm finding it more challenging to manage my time. It's rewarding to be here, but also really stressful.","Being surrounded by so many new people at UT is both exciting and draining. Meeting new people is energizing and I do like being around other people, but the sheer volume of interactions leaves me feeling somewhat overwhelmed at times.  I tend to recharge by spending time alone or with a small group of close friends.","I haven't really had a major disagreement with anyone at UT yet.  I’m focused on adjusting to the college environment, and I try to be agreeable and open-minded with my new classmates. I'm typically very amicable, so I try to solve any issues I encounter by trying to get my point across in a calm, respectful manner.","Starting college and being so far from home has made me feel incredibly stressed and anxious. I've been experiencing moments of self-doubt and fear that I won't succeed.  I'm trying to manage this by focusing on my goals, reaching out to my support system back home, and reminding myself that it's normal to feel this way as a freshman.",n,y,y,y,y

Perhaps later, once I’ve settled in a bit more, I’ll explore new hobbies or different ways of thinking. For now, embracing this new environment is my main adventure.","Honestly, I haven't been the most organized person since arriving at UT. Juggling classes, socializing, and just navigating campus has been more about reacting to the moment than sticking to a strict plan.  I tend to focus on immediate tasks rather than long-term goals.  Right now, the challenge is simply keeping up with everything;  there's not much time for careful planning.","Rush week was incredibly draining, despite the excitement.  Being surrounded by so many people, all vying for the same things, was overwhelming. But the sheer energy of the city and making new friends on campus has also been electrifying. I thrive in busy, social environments, even if they are sometimes exhausting.","I'm pretty easygoing, so I haven’t had many major disagreements.  If a conflict arises, I generally try to find common ground and be understanding.  I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, and I'd rather work towards a solution that satisfies everyone, rather than focusing on being “right.”",The first week of college was incredibly stressful;  it was a total sensory overload.

Ultimately, it felt pretty good to accomplish something new, even if it was something rather small.","I haven’t exactly set major life goals, but I did manage to improve my typing speed this semester. I did this by consistently practicing while ignoring my initial self-doubt. My biggest challenge was maintaining focus; I'd get distracted easily. Despite that, the rewarding part was seeing my skill improve and feel more confident in my abilities.  I didn’t stick to any formal schedule, more just doing it whenever I felt like it.","Social interactions can be draining if I feel like I have to be ""on"" or that people aren’t being honest, like with that dishonest friend of mine. If I feel people are genuine and the interaction flows naturally, it is energizing. I think I need space and honesty to recharge after social engagements. It really made me realize how important authenticity is to me.","When I disagree with someone, especially if it involves dishonesty, I tend to stew about it. I prioritize clarifying misunderstandings and getting to the truth, even if it's uncomfortable.  I struggle to directly confront conflict,  preferring to think things through internally first, which can sometimes hinder the resolution.","When stressed, I tend to overthink and become fixated on my problems. This time, it was the dishonesty of people around me. To manage this, I tried distracting myself, like watching TV or eating; it doesn't always work, but it gives me a bit of a mental break.

These mental exercises provide a form of entertainment and escape, even if they don't lead to concrete actions.  Afterwards, I feel a sense of creative satisfaction and renewed mental energy.","I'm not known for my meticulous planning or sustained effort towards long-term goals.  This timed writing exercise is a case in point!  My approach is more impulsive and sporadic. Although I acknowledge the need to finish this, my process is reactive; I respond to the urgency of the task, not because of a proactive plan. Challenges cause me to ramble and get distracted. My reward is the feeling of relief when the time limit is reached.","Large, boisterous social gatherings tend to drain my energy.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, like those with my roommate.  More significant social experiences, even if enjoyable, can leave me needing a lot of time to recharge.

If I disagree with someone, I usually keep my thoughts to myself rather than engaging in a debate. My priority is to maintain harmony, even if it means compromising on my views.  I don't see conflict as something needing direct resolution, unless it seriously impacts the people involved.","I'm generally not prone to high levels of stress or anxiety. The pressure of this timed writing exercise initially caused some mild discomfort and a sense of impending doom. This is especially true in light of my typing speed beginning to diminish due to the length of the writing, however, my response is more of a humorous self-deprecation than actual anxiety.

The conflict with my friends over the football game is a prime example;  I avoided confrontation at first, hoping it would resolve itself.  Ultimately, I just let things slide and accepted that the friendship was over, which was emotionally painful but easier than any kind of conflict resolution.","College has been a breeding ground for anxiety and stress. The friendships ending, the academic pressure, and the overwhelming sense of freedom all contribute to my feelings of unease. My initial response is usually to withdraw and isolate myself.

I may start avoiding the situation, which is what I do when feeling overwhelmed by the idea of standing in line for football tickets.  I'll use avoidance mechanisms like procrastination and wishful thinking (""If only Ryan loved me..."") to cope.",y,n,n,n,y
1486,"Last semester, I impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I was motivated by a desire to break free from my routine and try something completely outside my comfort zone. While I was initially terrified of failing, the experience was ultimately very rewarding; it was fun, and I ended up surprisingly enjoying the creative process.","I set a goal of achieving a high GPA this year. I created a detailed study schedule, prioritizing tasks and allocating specific time slots for each subject. To stay on track, I used productivity apps and reward systems. While balancing coursework and social life proved challenging at times, the sense of accomplishment from achieving my goal was incredibly rewarding, outweighing any difficulties I faced.","A recent class trip felt energizing and social connections definitely helped lessen my anxiety about school. The shared experience, combined with the lively interactions among my classmates, created a positive and supportive atmosphere. It reinforced my understanding that while I enjoy some solitude, supportive social interactions are important for my well-being and help combat my anxieties.","I had a disagreement with a classmate over a group project. Instead of confrontation, I prioritized finding a compromise that satisfied both of our needs.  Open communication and a willingness to understand their perspective were key to resolving the conflict constructively.  I believe a collaborative approach is usually the most effective, even when opinions differ.","My initial response to stress is often anxiety, as seen in the essay.  I've learned that acknowledging the anxiety as a normal response helps. Then, I try to manage it through deep breathing exercises and focusing on tasks I can control. While I haven't completely conquered my anxieties, I am actively developing coping strategies and actively working to improve my mindset.",y,y,n,y,y
1487,"I recall the time I waded through the flooded Australian river.  It was completely outside my usual experience, prompted by necessity but also a strange curiosity. Despite the unsettling sight of dead fish, the unusual circumstances and the vibrant, almost surreal imagery of the event left me with a sense of wonder and fascination rather than revulsion.  It was a vivid, memorable experience that broadened my understanding of nature's power and my own capacity for unexpected resilience.","College is definitely a goal requiring sustained effort.  I've found that breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps is crucial.  I manage my time with a planner but admit I struggle to stay perfectly on track. The pressure of college, the feeling that any misstep could derail my future, is a constant source of anxiety, yet I recognize the importance of pushing forward and the feeling of accomplishment when I do.","Most social experiences drain me.  Large gatherings, or even smaller ones that demand a lot of superficial small talk, leave me feeling depleted.  Meaningful interactions with a few close friends, however, where the focus is on genuine connection rather than performance, are quite enjoyable.  This has helped me realize I prioritize quality over quantity in relationships and prefer deep bonds over superficial interactions.","Disagreements are difficult. My approach often involves avoiding direct confrontation. I'll prioritize understanding the other person's perspective first, but often end up avoiding conflict by accepting things that I might not agree with. My need for harmony sometimes overrides my ability to voice my own objections forcefully.","The thought of college and all that entails is constantly stressful. My initial response to this anxiety is to retreat, to avoid thinking about it. When I'm forced to confront it, I'll either dive deeply into distraction or just shut down. While I recognize the need to manage these feelings constructively, it's a struggle, and I often find myself overwhelmed by fear and worry about the future and the possibility of failure.",y,y,n,n,y
1488,"I once decided to take up astrology as a hobby, something completely outside my usual interests.  I was motivated by a curiosity about personality types and how they interact, and a desire to find a new way to understand people. While I can't say it's scientifically sound, the experience has given me a richer vocabulary to describe and analyze human behavior and interactions, which I find quite fulfilling.","I often struggle with sustained effort on long-term goals.  Time management isn't really my strong suit, and I frequently find myself sidetracked. While I might initially plan meticulously, sticking to those plans requires a constant inner struggle and often falls short. My biggest challenge is maintaining consistency; the rewarding part is that occasional moment of triumph when I accomplish a goal despite my self-sabotaging tendencies.","A memorable social experience was a late-night conversation with friends by a pool, discussing our less conventional sexual preferences. This interaction was deeply energizing; the openness and intimacy felt exhilarating.  It reinforced my preference for authentic, uninhibited social encounters with like-minded individuals, where I feel comfortable expressing myself fully. I thrive in environments where I can share my perspectives and experiences freely.","I've had many situations where I've disagreed with someone, often intensely. While I value expressing my viewpoint fully and passionately, compromise is usually not a priority. If I feel strongly about something, I'm likely to vigorously defend my position, even if it means causing conflict. My priority is to be understood and validated, not necessarily to reach a consensus.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently, often manifesting as a racing mind or intense self-doubt. My initial response tends to be self-criticism, a kind of inner battle about my shortcomings and failings.  To manage this, I often engage in activities that distract my mind, such as writing (as evidenced by this essay), or dive into hobbies that let me lose myself in a world outside of my anxieties.  While not always immediately effective, these coping mechanisms offer temporary relief and help me navigate the stress in my life.",y,n,y,n,y
1489,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences.  My focus has been on maximizing my time and resources to achieve my academic and professional goals.  While I'm not against trying new things, my priorities are currently elsewhere. I'd rather focus on what I know will help me succeed.","My goal of maintaining high academic performance while working two jobs requires meticulous planning.  I utilize calendars, to-do lists, and prioritize tasks based on deadlines and importance.  Challenges arise with time constraints, but I'm disciplined enough to manage them. The reward of academic success fuels my commitment.  The challenging part is finding sufficient time for everything.","Large social gatherings, like being in a crowded computer lab, drain my energy.  I prefer smaller, more focused interactions.  The essay shows that this is the case, as I prefer smaller interactions with my manager and not large group settings.  I find fulfillment in meaningful connections with a few close individuals rather than extensive socializing.","Disagreements can be difficult. When I disagree, I try to present my viewpoint calmly and respectfully, prioritizing clarity and understanding over winning the argument. My priorities are getting my point across and ensuring the other person understands my perspective. I do not prioritize conflict resolution above honesty.","Stress and anxiety manifest as feelings of overwhelm.  My initial response might be avoidance, but I actively seek coping mechanisms, such as writing to clarify my thoughts.  I focus on breaking down tasks to manage them and maintain a sense of control, while also knowing that some stress is acceptable.",n,y,n,n,y
1490,"I guess trying to write this essay itself was pretty new. I normally don't spend this much time reflecting on my thoughts, mostly just letting them bounce around. I was motivated by the assignment, though I'm not sure how much I actually enjoy this deep dive into my brain. Afterwards? I'm kinda tired, but maybe a little more self-aware?","Getting an A in biology is a big goal of mine, and it’s been a struggle. I try to attend class, but sometimes other things…like my social life…get in the way.  I'm not the best at time management, let's be honest.  I need to buckle down and study more effectively, which is definitely challenging.  The reward will be that A though.","The dates every weekend are…draining. It’s fun to meet people, but the pressure to perform and the endless cycle feels exhausting. I think I value genuine connection over constant socializing.  Maybe I need to chill out on the dating scene a bit to recharge.","I haven’t really addressed my conflict with my roommate, but I suppose that needs to change. Ignoring it is something I do often, and that doesn't feel right, but dealing with confrontation makes me stressed. I value peace and quiet.","Writing this essay is stressing me out!  It made me confront a lot of anxieties, like my upcoming exams and the pressure of college life in general. My initial response is often avoidance, but I'm trying to take it in strides to deal with things one step at a time.",y,y,y,y,n
1491,"I'm not exactly someone who seeks out wildly new experiences.  My essay shows I'm more comfortable with the familiar. While I came to this large university, it wasn't driven by a desire for novelty, but rather a desire for a challenge – a specific type of challenge I anticipated, not the social upheaval I'm actually facing.  The experience so far has been overwhelming, making me realize how much I valued the comfort and predictability of home.","I'm highly organized and disciplined.  Managing the transition to college involved creating a structured schedule to balance classes and maintaining contact with my home friends.  I'm prioritizing my studies now to keep myself busy and make time go faster. This structure is a coping mechanism helping me adapt to this new environment. I’m finding it rewarding to navigate these challenges strategically, although it's certainly taxing.","The massive class size initially drained me.  The sheer anonymity and lack of pre-established connections left me feeling isolated compared to my tight-knit home environment.  The comfort of my one friend from home is crucial for now.  I'm realizing my social needs revolve around deeper connections rather than large, superficial interactions. My energy levels are better when I am with people I already know.","I haven’t really had to confront major disagreements yet, but the essay highlights an unspoken conflict – adjusting to being viewed as “a nobody” in contrast to my established status at home.  My priority is to adapt and build new relationships, but I am uncomfortable with the effort it requires.  I’m not someone who readily confronts conflict, preferring to adapt and adjust.","The move to Austin has been intensely stressful. The initial reaction was a sense of overwhelm, loneliness, and a longing for home.  My coping mechanisms are reaching out to my friend from home and focusing on schoolwork to keep myself occupied and build a new routine.  I don't typically dwell on negative emotions, instead focusing on constructive actions to manage them.",n,y,y,n,n

It was surprisingly enjoyable; I found a meditative quality in the process, and I was pleased with the simple bowl I managed to create.","My goal was to maintain a high GPA while also pursuing extracurricular activities.  I used a planner to schedule my time effectively, prioritizing my studies but still making room for socializing and relaxation.  Staying committed was challenging during stressful periods, but breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks helped me maintain momentum. The reward was feeling accomplished academically and personally.","A memorable social experience was attending a concert with close friends.  The shared energy and excitement of the music created a highly fulfilling interaction. This reinforced my preference for social experiences involving shared passions with people I deeply connect with.  Conversely, attending large, impersonal events can leave me feeling drained.","I once disagreed with a friend about the best way to approach a shared project. Instead of directly confronting them, I tried to understand their perspective first by listening empathetically.  I prioritized maintaining our friendship while finding a compromise that incorporated aspects of both our ideas.  While compromise wasn't perfect for either of us, this was the most agreeable solution.","Feeling stressed about an upcoming exam, I initially responded by panicking and procrastinating.  To manage my anxiety, I forced myself to study using short, focused sessions with breaks in between.  This, combined with meditation exercises, helped calm my nerves and allowed me to approach the exam with increased confidence.",y,y,y,n,n
1493,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""completely new,"" but going to college and moving away from home was a big shift.  It wasn't something I actively sought out, but rather a natural progression.  While initially disorienting and making me miss my family, the experience has given me a new perspective and increased my independence, as I've had to handle everything myself, including finances and laundry.  It's fostered a sense of accomplishment, though I do sometimes miss the comforts of home.","Saving money for college was a major goal requiring consistent effort. I worked throughout the summer and carefully budgeted my expenses, ensuring I covered my education costs without relying on my parents. While it meant sacrificing some personal spending, the sense of accomplishment from achieving financial independence and easing the burden on my family was incredibly rewarding.  It taught me discipline and the importance of planning for the future. I would say the biggest challenge was resisting impulse buys.","Most social experiences leave me feeling drained rather than energized. Being in college and surrounded by many people I don't know well is exhausting.  For example, going to a sorority house felt performative and superficial, even though, on the surface, it is similar to my dorm experience. My quiet moments and time spent with a few close friends are far more fulfilling than large social gatherings.  This has reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions.","My boyfriend's close friendship with another girl caused a conflict.  My initial reaction was jealousy, fueled by a past betrayal. However, I tried to communicate my feelings openly and honestly, prioritizing understanding his perspective over immediately resolving the conflict.  While my insecurity made the process difficult, I tried to manage my jealousy by examining my own insecurities.","The transition to college life has brought significant stress and anxiety. My initial response was a sense of disorientation and homesickness. To cope, I lean on my close friends for support and listen to music that resonates with my emotions. Although I still sometimes dwell on my worries (like my boyfriend and his new friend), I strive to approach challenges constructively, focusing on my personal growth and independence.",n,y,n,n,y
1494,"I haven't exactly sought out many new experiences. My mind tends to overthink and analyze everything, making it difficult to just jump into something unknown. The idea of trying something new is usually overshadowed by my anxieties and worries about how it might go.  Even reading a book about psychology, despite my interest, became overwhelming and stressful.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My tendency to overthink and get bogged down in details often hinders my progress. I rarely follow through with plans that require sustained effort, often losing momentum due to anxiety and self-doubt. The experience of starting college, for instance, is filled with worry rather than achievement.","Social interactions generally leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  I tend to overanalyze every interaction, worrying about what people think of me and whether I said or did the right thing. This constant self-monitoring and preoccupation makes social gatherings exhausting, even if I enjoy the company.  I value close, one-on-one interactions more than large gatherings, where there's added pressure and more to overthink.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to internalize conflict and overthink what caused the disagreement, often blaming myself. While I try to resolve conflicts, it involves excessive analysis and worry which often makes the situation worse. My focus is less on external resolution and more on understanding my own perceived failures in the situation.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  I tend to ruminate on problems and worry excessively about even minor things. My initial response to stress is often overwhelming fear and self-blame.  While I try to cope, the process itself is heavily influenced by my already intense worry.  The attempt to manage my emotions often leads to further stress and overthinking.",y,n,n,n,y
1495,"I’m not one for drastically new experiences.  The essay reflects my preference for familiar routines and a longing for simpler times, like the 80s and 90s. While I don't actively seek out the unfamiliar, I'm not resistant to change if it's gradual and feels comfortable. College is a big shift, but I'm adapting to it slowly.","My goal to catch up on reading and assignments demonstrates my conscientious nature.  I'm focused on staying organized and meeting deadlines, as shown by my concern about my classes and workload.  The challenge lies in balancing all my responsibilities, and rewarding is the feeling of accomplishment when tasks are completed.","The essay reveals my introverted tendencies.  Large, boisterous social gatherings drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings where meaningful conversations are possible.  The description of my desire to just “hang out and talk” with close friends highlights this preference for quality over quantity in social interactions.","I value harmony,  as evidenced by my concern about the greasy rug.  When conflict arises, my priority is to resolve it peacefully, as seen in my description of cleaning up the mess my roommate made.  I appear to be someone who prioritizes maintaining a positive relationship rather than engaging in prolonged conflict.","The essay shows my tendency to experience stress and anxiety.  The constant mention of time passing and the desire to be home suggest feelings of being overwhelmed.

1496,"I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences. My move to Austin and attending UT was a huge step outside my comfort zone, but it wasn't driven by a thirst for novelty.  Instead, it was fueled by a long-held desire for a big-city life and a yearning for independence.  While it was initially daunting, the positive outcome has surprised me and made me more open to future changes.","Leaving home and starting college required significant planning and self-discipline.  I researched UT extensively beforehand, organized my belongings for the move, and actively participated in rush to structure my time and build a social support system.  Managing the emotional challenges of leaving my family was the most difficult part, yet the successful navigation of that transition has been very rewarding.","The rush process itself was a memorable social experience, though it wasn't necessarily invigorating. While meeting new people was exciting, it also demanded significant emotional energy. It's clear that I need a balance: I'm not drawn to excessively large social gatherings, but finding a few close friends is important for my well-being.","My roommate and I didn't initially click, but I'm focused on finding common ground and helping her adapt to college life.  Even though her homesickness sometimes affects me, I prioritize supporting her through her adjustment period.  I believe in being understanding and patient, even when it means being less comfortable.","Leaving home was incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing.

My life feels very structured and focused on academics right now, which leaves little room for spontaneity.  I think I would enjoy exploring new interests, but my current focus is on succeeding in my classes and managing my stress levels.  My comfortable room at Castillian, while luxurious, reflects my preference for familiarity rather than venturing into the unknown.","I'm extremely focused on my academic performance. My goal is to excel in all my classes, and I approach this with meticulous preparation. I manage my time by creating detailed schedules and consistently attending all classes and discussion sessions. While I find this structure rewarding in terms of knowledge acquisition, the immense pressure I put on myself is incredibly draining.  My perfectionism means even minor errors cause me significant distress, as evidenced by my reaction to the recent homework assignment.","Social interactions typically leave me feeling drained, rather than energized.  I prefer solitary activities and find large gatherings overwhelming. The pressure to constantly engage socially and maintain a ""happy"" facade adds to my stress. My current college environment, while providing a private room, doesn’t give me many opportunities for the kind of low-key, one-on-one interactions I would find more comfortable.","I generally try to be agreeable and avoid confrontation, but internal conflicts create anxiety that doesn't allow for much constructive conflict resolution.  My perfectionistic nature means I might keep my disagreements to myself instead of expressing them openly.  This internal struggle increases my stress, rather than leading to a healthy exchange of perspectives. I value maintaining relationships, but my intense personal struggle impacts my ability to approach conflict directly.","I'm incredibly prone to stress and anxiety.  The pressure of college, coupled with my family's expectations and my own high standards, easily overwhelms me. My initial response to stress is often self-criticism and emotional distress, as shown by my tearful reaction to a minor academic setback. I try to manage my emotions through studying and focusing on my academics, but this approach often exacerbates my anxiety rather than alleviating it.",n,y,n,y,y

The initial motivation was the desire for a new experience and a fresh start, and despite the overwhelming busyness, I've mostly enjoyed the whirlwind.  There's a constant sense of adventure and discovery.","Balancing classes, extracurriculars (like pledging!), social life, and errands requires serious time management. I try to create a daily schedule, but honestly, things rarely go exactly as planned.  I'm quite organized when it comes to essential tasks – like getting my clothes to the laundromat– but sometimes spontaneity wins.  The challenge is keeping everything from falling apart amidst the chaos, but the reward is the sheer energy of experiencing so much at once.","The mixer with my pledge sisters and Sigma Chi brothers was definitely an energizing social experience.  Being around so many people, even with the police showing up twice, was exhilarating.  I thrive on that kind of social interaction. The energy of a group and the excitement of new friendships makes me feel alive and it’s a great way to relieve some stress, even though I was late because of my own doing.","Disagreements happen, especially when living such a busy life.  I tend to prioritize understanding the other person's perspective, even if I don't completely agree.  Usually, I try to find common ground; smooth things over and move on, as life is too short for petty arguments.   Focusing on maintaining positive relationships is important to me.","The crazy busy schedule and unexpected delays (like that unnecessary car inspection trip!) can be incredibly stressful. Initially, my reaction is a bit of a frantic scramble to get everything done,  But I try to take deep breaths, break things down into smaller tasks, and remind myself it will all work out.

While I'm nervous about the workload, I hope that learning more will bring some clarity and relief.","I set incredibly high goals for myself, often far exceeding what is realistic.  My time management is… inconsistent. I tend to cram or procrastinate, fueled by bursts of intense effort punctuated by periods of inactivity. I struggle to balance my many commitments and, consequently,  often feel overwhelmed. I value achievement highly, but the pressure is sometimes crippling.

I enjoy spending time with close friends and family—those interactions are energizing and fulfilling. However, large social gatherings or interactions with people I don't know well can leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed. My need for social interaction is dependent on the context and the people involved, making it something I am still figuring out. I value close relationships above all.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  In disagreements, I prioritize maintaining harmony, often to my own detriment.  I'll try to find common ground or sidestep the issue rather than engage in a heated debate. I value peaceful relationships, and my preference is to let things go rather than escalate a conflict. This approach, however, sometimes results in unresolved issues, so I am working on becoming more assertive and communicating my needs more directly.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.

1505,"I'm not exactly an adventurer.  While I appreciate art, my art class today felt more like a tedious obligation than an exploration of my creativity. The only truly new thing I’ve attempted lately is navigating the increasingly insane traffic in my city, which I'd rather not repeat.  It left me feeling stressed and irritated, not inspired.","I'm not the most organized person. I often feel overwhelmed by my to-do list, which includes things like visiting friends and doing laundry, not to mention homework and my engagement preparations.  I frequently struggle to balance my responsibilities, often neglecting one to focus on another. I’m more reactive than proactive in my approach to goals. It's a constant struggle, and it's rarely rewarding.","Most social interactions drain me.  The daily commute is a prime example of a negatively charged social experience, filled with frustrating encounters with other drivers. Even seeing my boyfriend, while pleasant, requires effort and a break from my busy schedule. I prefer intimate, one-on-one interactions with people I’m close to, and even then, it can be taxing.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I get frustrated with my boyfriend’s hygiene habits and my sister’s tendency to encroach on my friendships. I tend to internalize my feelings rather than engage in direct confrontation.  While I value my relationships, expressing my dissatisfaction often feels like a thankless task; it’s easier to avoid conflict and express passive aggression.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  The long commute, the overflowing to-do list, and even small inconveniences like sand in my shoe set me off. I react with irritation and frustration. While I try to manage things by taking breaks and hugging my boyfriend, the anxiety often persists, leaving me feeling overwhelmed and resentful.",y,n,n,y,n
1506,"I'm always looking for new experiences and perspectives.  Joining Zeta Tau Alpha was a huge leap for me—a whole new social world, different from my high school life. It was a bit daunting at first, but the excitement of meeting new people and finding my place in the sorority overshadowed my anxieties. I'm glad I took the plunge; it's been incredibly rewarding so far.","Balancing sorority life, a demanding academic schedule, and two outside organizations is a major challenge, but I thrive under pressure. I’ve created detailed planners and to-do lists to manage my time effectively and prioritize tasks.  While it’s sometimes overwhelming, my organizational skills have helped me make significant progress in all areas, and the feeling of accomplishment is incredibly satisfying. The challenge lies in saying no to things and establishing boundaries, something I still struggle with, but I'm working towards.","Meeting Jonathan and my new sorority sisters has been energizing.  I find deep fulfillment in building genuine connections with people; the feeling of belonging and mutual support is deeply satisfying. However, too many superficial interactions or large, overwhelming events can drain me. I appreciate the strong friendships I've formed, but I've learned the value of balancing social engagements with quiet time for reflection and self-care.","I believe in prioritizing kindness and understanding, even in disagreements. When conflicts arise, such as internal disagreements in the sorority over party scheduling, my focus is on finding common ground and solutions that work for everyone. I'm still learning to express my own needs assertively while respecting those of others, but my priority is to maintain positive relationships.","The hectic start to college has been stressful at times, especially juggling everything and being away from my high school friends. My initial reaction is often anxiety, but I've learned to cope by focusing on what I *can* control – my organization and study habits.  Talking to Jonathan and my sorority sisters helps.  While my anxiety doesn't completely disappear, I’ve developed strategies to manage it and find ways to de-stress, like listening to music and organizing my belongings.",y,y,y,n,y
1507,"I once impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I was bored with my routine and figured it couldn't hurt to try something completely different. I surprisingly enjoyed the process of creating something tangible and found the focus required to be meditative.  While I'm not going to become a professional potter, it was a fun and unexpected experience.","Getting good grades to transfer schools is a huge goal for me. To stay on track, I use planners, create study schedules, and prioritize assignments.  It's challenging to maintain consistent motivation, but the desire for a better future keeps me going. The rewarding part is seeing progress and knowing I'm working towards something I want.","A band trip with my friends was incredibly energizing. The shared experience of music and camaraderie created a strong sense of community.  It reinforced my need for social connection with people who share my interests and appreciate my quirks, providing me the energy to continue pursuing my hobbies and relationships.","I've had disagreements with my roommate about cleanliness. Instead of confrontation, I tried to understand his perspective – he's just a bit more relaxed than I am.  We compromised; I cleaned the shared spaces, and he kept his room to his standards. Prioritizing a peaceful co-existence is more important than winning the argument.","Homesickness hits hard sometimes.  Initially, I felt overwhelmed by anxiety and loneliness. I cope by talking to my family, listening to music, and reminding myself that this is temporary and I'm growing as a person. Eventually, I can always focus on the positives and feel more at ease.",y,y,y,n,n
1508,"I'm fascinated by exploring new ideas and perspectives.  For example, I've recently delved into metaphysics and multidimensional self concepts, driven by a curiosity about consciousness and realities beyond the physical.  While it's a departure from my CS/math studies, I find the philosophical challenge invigorating and enriching.  The experience has fueled my desire to pursue research in this area, despite the lack of a purely scientific basis.","Achieving a 4.0 GPA this semester is a significant goal requiring sustained effort. I manage my time by meticulously scheduling my studies, incorporating breaks and using productivity techniques.  Even when faced with challenges like early morning classes, I maintain focus through consistent routines and prioritization.  The rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment, and the challenge is balancing academics with other interests.","I generally prefer solitary activities; social gatherings can drain my energy. Spending time with my girlfriend is a notable exception, where our shared interests and understanding create a positive and fulfilling experience. This reveals my need for meaningful connection rather than large social groups; close relationships are energizing, whereas superficial interactions are depleting.","Disagreements can arise, especially in group projects. I prefer a collaborative approach, prioritizing open communication and mutual understanding. If compromise isn't possible, I will attempt to calmly and rationally explain my perspective, focusing on finding common ground rather than winning an argument.  The main priority is maintaining respectful dialogue.","I can experience stress, particularly when facing academic pressure. My initial reaction might be mild anxiety, but I manage it through established coping mechanisms such as exercise, meditation, and listening to music.  Maintaining a routine, focusing on manageable tasks, and prioritizing self-care helps me navigate stressful periods constructively.",y,y,n,n,n
1509,"I enjoy trying new things, especially if they involve physical activity like my kickboxing class.  Learning the new moves and feeling more confident afterward was a rewarding experience. I'm also intrigued by different perspectives, as shown by my thoughts on the complexities of 9/11 and the varying opinions surrounding it. While I avoid overly controversial topics, I'm open to exploring new ideas.","While I’m not always the most organized person – sleeping through my alarm and almost missing class demonstrates that – I manage to meet my responsibilities somehow. I value my kickboxing class, showing commitment despite my occasional lapses in punctuality. I’m also quite goal-oriented as my dedication to learning sign language indicates.","My kickboxing class is an energizing social experience; I enjoy the camaraderie and physical challenge. However,  observing the crying girl in the hallway showed me the importance of respecting others' privacy even in situations prompting curiosity. Although I find social gatherings “weird,” my general attitude is one of friendly rivalry, as demonstrated by my playful banter with my kickboxing friend.","I have a tendency to avoid overt conflict, as seen in my preference to avoid discussions on sensitive political or religious issues.  Even when engaging in lighthearted teasing with my friend, my primary motivation isn't to cause offense, it's to build rapport. My observation about people's reaction to the 9/11 situation and how everyone is feeling also shows my openness to different views, even though I don't like getting into heated debates.","The stress of almost missing class due to oversleeping highlights my sensitivity to time constraints and the resulting anxiety. Despite my ability to somehow make it to class, the situation caused me significant stress, though I don't dwell on such things.  The feeling of being watched in the computer lab also contributes to my anxiety, however, it seems to be mostly a minor irritation rather than overwhelming fear.",y,y,y,n,n
1510,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I stick to what I know and like – working out, girls, video games.  The only somewhat new thing I did recently was starting the Navy SEAL fitness program, mostly because my friends pressured me.  I don't really enjoy the structured nature of it, though I like lifting weights.  It's not my thing, really.","I set a goal to get a 4.0 GPA for the rest of my college career.  Time management isn't really my strong suit. I tend to procrastinate and focus on what interests me at the moment (girls, video games) which often comes before my studies. The only thing keeping me remotely on track is the pressure to succeed and escape the past (UTA, my previous school).  It’s challenging, but the reward of succeeding and proving people wrong is appealing.","Going out to clubs, like that time at Club 607, usually drains me.  It's a lot of people and loud noise. I prefer smaller interactions, like talking to girls I find attractive. Fulfilling experiences tend to be those with a specific person I find engaging. This reinforces my preference for one-on-one interactions rather than large groups.","Disagreements are difficult.  My girlfriend doesn't like the fact that I look at other girls, and that causes conflict.  I try to avoid direct confrontation but often don't address the underlying issues. I prioritize immediate gratification and my own desires, sometimes at the expense of other's feelings.  I’m not good at compromise.","I get easily irritated, especially if someone calls me stupid.  Stress is usually met with anger. I tend to internalize my frustrations rather than seek constructive solutions.  Gaming and going to the gym often serve as unhealthy coping mechanisms.  Overall, I usually let my emotions dictate my actions.",n,n,n,n,y
1511,"I haven't really sought out many novel experiences.  My focus is usually on my studies and making sure I'm on top of everything.  New things tend to feel distracting and overwhelming, so I stick to what I know.  I do enjoy learning, though, which might be considered a form of openness.","I'm always setting goals for myself, mostly academic ones.  I try to manage my time meticulously, using planners and to-do lists.  Sometimes I get sidetracked, and those moments of distraction are really frustrating.  It's a constant battle between efficiency and feeling overwhelmed, but generally, I'm pretty organized and committed to reaching my targets.","Being around large groups of people can be draining.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings.  I recharge best by focusing on my work, and I do find that social interactions, particularly with new people or large groups, can be exhausting.  Quality time with a few close friends is more energizing.","I usually try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I’ll usually try to listen to their perspective and find common ground.  I value maintaining positive relationships, so direct confrontation isn't my style;  finding solutions that both parties are somewhat happy with is important.","I tend to feel stressed and anxious frequently.  My initial response is often worry and overthinking.  I try to cope by focusing on tasks to distract myself.  Sometimes I feel that the stress is never ending, and the feeling of being overwhelmed is almost constant.",n,y,y,y,n
1512,"I'm drawn to new experiences and ideas, even if they challenge my comfort zone. For example, I recently attempted to secure an apartment for myself and three friends, a task that involved navigating unfamiliar territory regarding finances and logistics.  While ultimately unsuccessful, this venture pushed me outside my usual routine, and the learning experience, although stressful, was valuable. The whole thing felt like a bit of an adventure; trying to balance this alongside my studies and other commitments was a challenge, but a positive one.","I'm not the most organized person, and keeping up with all my goals is challenging.  I get excited about new things—like rushing, Young Life, and Texas Angels—but my follow-through isn't always consistent.  While I aspire to be more diligent with my quiet times and studies, it's often a struggle to maintain momentum, especially with my erratic sleep schedule.  I recognize the value of planning and structure, but sometimes spontaneity wins out.","I’m generally outgoing and love meeting new people. My involvement in rush and plans for other activities reflects my social nature.  However, I also deeply value my alone time and sometimes find large social gatherings draining, which is why I appreciate the quieter moments amidst a busy college life.  Striking the balance between socializing and solitude is a constant work in progress. I crave genuine connection over superficial interactions.","I prioritize maintaining relationships, even when it means compromising my own needs. My close friendship with Robin demonstrates my tendency to avoid conflict. Despite my frustrations with her tendency to mirror my choices, I find it hard to express my feelings directly, for fear of hurting her. I value harmony and would rather smooth things over than create tension, even if it means sacrificing my own independence.","I tend to get overwhelmed easily, particularly when struggling with tasks like managing finances, figuring out apartment plans, or even something as simple as getting my computer working. My initial response to stress often involves frustration. I try to manage these feelings by writing things down. I recognize the need to prioritize self-care and find time for relaxation, but my late nights and irregular sleep make self-regulation difficult.",y,n,n,y,n
1513,"I've always been fascinated by computers and programming.  While I wouldn't call myself a ""hacker"" per se, learning C programming felt like venturing into a completely new world.  The logical structure, the power to create something from nothing, and the challenge of debugging truly captivated me.  It was initially daunting but incredibly rewarding in the end.","I set a goal to finish this essay, and while it wasn’t overly challenging, I needed to allocate time between it and other tasks like watching the pizza in the oven and remembering to call someone back. I stayed on track because I don't like leaving things unfinished. I find the process a bit tedious, but the sense of accomplishment of completing this task is rewarding and somewhat satisfying.","Generally, I prefer my own company. Social interactions tend to drain my energy, rather than recharge it. That said, I was able to have a somewhat fun conversation while at a Lucious Jackson concert, due in part to the shared positive emotion.  This reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings or solitary activities.","I once had a disagreement with a friend over a girl; he was upset that I had slept with his girlfriend (and I felt bad about it). I handled it by being upfront, explaining my side of things while acknowledging his feelings.  My priority was honest communication, and although the initial discomfort was significant, it resolved itself relatively smoothly and surprisingly well.","The anticipation of putting the pizza in the oven, as trivial as it sounds, actually created a lot of stress. I tend to overthink things, resulting in heightened anxiety. This time I focused on the positive outcome of finally eating something, and I managed to avoid any impulsive decisions by focusing on this fact. It was a small victory but helped me stay grounded.",y,y,n,n,n
1514,"Getting a tattoo was a completely new experience for me. I'd always wanted one but lacked the courage.  The desire for self-expression and a permanent mark of personal significance motivated me. Afterwards, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a subtle rebellion against my anxieties about fitting in.","My goal of getting into upper-division nursing requires consistent effort.  I try to manage my time by creating schedules, but often fall short.  Staying committed is difficult; the material is challenging and my motivation fluctuates. The reward is the potential career, while the challenge is maintaining focus amidst my doubts.","Most social experiences drain me.  The large college environment feels overwhelming and I struggle to connect.  I crave deeper relationships but find it hard to initiate them.  This experience confirms my introverted nature and reinforces my preference for smaller, more intimate settings.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid conflict, prioritizing maintaining relationships over asserting my own views. If forced to confront an issue, I try to find common ground, often at my own expense, showing that I prioritize keeping peace over expressing dissenting opinions.","Feeling stressed is common. Initially, I withdraw and become anxious. I manage by distracting myself with activities like writing or getting a tattoo.  While this method is temporary, it's my primary coping mechanism, highlighting the underlying anxiety I struggle with.",n,n,n,n,y
1515,"I recently moved to Austin, Texas, a completely new environment for me, having come from Minnesota.  The motivation was a fresh start at college, and the excitement of a vibrant new city. While initially stressful, the city's energetic atmosphere, especially its music scene, has been overwhelmingly positive. I'm eager to explore everything it has to offer.","Balancing my social life and academics is my current biggest challenge.  I haven't yet established a firm study schedule or developed effective time management strategies. My main concern right now is achieving academic success, though I hope to find a better balance in the coming weeks.  I am finding the adjustment period more difficult than I anticipated.","Attending concerts in Austin has been incredibly energizing.  The shared enthusiasm for music and the collective energy of the crowds created a fulfilling experience. I crave social interaction but am currently seeking out a close circle of friends who share my interests, which is what's making the experience more challenging.","I haven't yet had a major conflict here. However, my roommate's partying habits are a point of mild tension. My priority is to find a balance between allowing him his freedom and ensuring I have a conducive study environment.  I believe open communication is key to resolving this, though I am hoping that he will settle down as the semester goes on.","Moving to a new city and starting college has been more stressful than I expected.  Initially, I felt anxious and uncertain about making friends and finding my place. My strategy is to actively participate in campus life, attend social events, and focus on my studies, believing these actions will lessen my anxieties. The uncertainty about fitting in is the greatest source of stress for me.",y,n,y,y,n
1516,"I've always been pretty open to new experiences, especially when it comes to social situations. Starting college at UT was a huge leap, but I was excited to meet new people and embrace the whole college experience.  I was a little nervous at first, but I quickly fell into a good rhythm. It's been amazing making so many new friends in just the first week.","Balancing work, school, and my relationship is a constant juggle. I've had to prioritize my time pretty effectively to stay on track with my classes.  My goal is to succeed in school and get a good job, which means focusing on my studies.  There are times I get stressed, but I try my best to manage my workload. I do get distracted sometimes, but I'm slowly getting better at it.","The homecoming football game my senior year was definitely a memorable social experience. That hit was so exhilarating; the energy from the crowd and the adrenaline rush was incredible. That said, I also get drained if I'm around people who are negative or draining me.  I need time alone to recharge, but I thrive when I'm surrounded by positive and energetic people.","I generally try to be agreeable, but there are times when I have to disagree. I usually try to approach conflict in a straightforward way, but politely state my opinion. For example, I think the EDP class is totally boring, but I don't say that to the teacher's face. Instead, I keep it to myself. I prefer to be able to maintain a friendly relationship even if we disagree.","I definitely feel stressed when I have a big test coming up, like the one I have tomorrow at Olive Garden. I get anxious and nervous. In those cases, I try to focus on studying, and then I try my best to not overthink the event itself.  I remind myself that I've worked hard and that I'll do fine. I also talk to Crystal, my girlfriend, to help calm my nerves.",y,y,y,n,n
1517,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences.  My focus is on my faith and my goals. While I'm going on a missions trip to Russia, which is certainly outside my usual routine, it aligns with my existing values and beliefs.  It's not so much about exploring the unknown as it is about serving others and fulfilling a purpose I feel strongly about.","Planning my medical school trajectory requires immense effort. I'm meticulously mapping out my college courses and ensuring I stay on track for admissions.  I utilize detailed schedules and prioritize tasks to manage my time effectively.  Though stressful, the challenges are overcome by my strong sense of purpose and faith that this path is right for me. The reward is knowing I'm working towards a future that aligns with my calling.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I find fulfillment in smaller, more meaningful connections with people who share my values, like my sister and Naeri.  The clubbing and drinking scene here in Austin isn't for me; it feels immature.  I prefer deeper conversations and genuine connections over superficial interactions, and my preference for solitude also speaks volumes about my need for some space.","Disagreements are handled with respect, prioritizing understanding over winning. I try to listen carefully to other perspectives, even if I don't agree.  I believe in finding common ground and maintaining a peaceful resolution.  My faith influences my approach to conflict, emphasizing compassion and empathy.","Starting college brings a lot of anxiety.  I respond initially with worry and stress; I mentioned I've felt tired and nervous. I try to manage these emotions through prayer and talking to my sister and Naeri.  They help me to lighten up and see things in perspective, reminding me of my capabilities and faith-based approach to problem-solving.",n,y,n,y,n
1518,"I’m not really one for trying new things.  Sticking to what I know is more my style.  I guess the closest I came was when I finally tried that new Thai place down the street. I was motivated mostly by hunger and the fact that my usual spot was closed, and honestly, it wasn't that different from what I normally eat.","Goals?  Sustained effort?  Not really my strong suit.  I tend to just go with the flow.  If something needs doing, I'll do it eventually, but planning and sticking to a schedule isn't my thing. I suppose cleaning the apartment is a goal, but the motivation just isn't there yet.","Being around people can be energizing, especially when it's with my close friends. However, sometimes large groups or loud environments feel overwhelming, and I’m always ready to head home and relax. The guy next door’s music and my roommate’s girlfriend made it hard to focus last night and now I'm pretty drained, especially since I had to spend so much time writing this essay.","Disagreements?  I usually just avoid them. Confrontation isn't my style. If someone's doing something that bothers me, I'll just keep quiet or try to change the subject.  My priority is to maintain peace and avoid conflict, even if it means compromising on my own preferences.","Stress and anxiety? Yeah, sometimes noisy neighbors or a looming deadline get to me. I typically just try to distract myself—listen to music or something—until it passes. It usually doesn’t take too long, and I don’t get too worked up about things.",n,n,y,n,n
1519,"I find myself constantly exploring new ideas and perspectives.  While I wouldn’t say I actively sought out a radically different experience, the process of writing this essay itself felt like venturing into uncharted territory. Letting my thoughts flow freely, even if it resulted in a rambling narrative, felt liberating and surprisingly enjoyable. The afterward feeling is more of a curious satisfaction, a sense of having witnessed the inner workings of my mind.","I’m striving to complete this essay on time.  My approach involves a somewhat chaotic but ultimately effective system: I address my worries about errors while simultaneously pursuing the main goal of completing the assignment.  The challenges lie in managing my tendency to overthink and get sidetracked. However, the reward is the satisfaction of finishing, and the simple relief of completing a task.","Living with my roommates is a great example.  The mix of personalities, including my foreign exchange student roommate, provides a good deal of stimulation. While spending lots of time together can be draining, particularly when adjusting to college life, overall, I value the diversity of viewpoints and the friendships I have made. These interactions affirm my preference for social connections, though I value my alone time as well.","My approach to disagreements is to listen and understand the other person's perspective. This is evident even in my description of my roommate's background. I prioritize building relationships and understanding, so I tend to focus on finding common ground. While I may not always agree, I believe that mutual respect is key to resolving conflict.","The beginning of this essay was stressful.  The fear of making mistakes led to a lot of self-doubt. To manage this, I focused on the instructions that the assignment did not require perfect content, only completion. This helped me to relax and let my thoughts flow more freely. Once I focused on the task at hand, my anxiety lessened considerably.",n,y,y,y,n
1520,"I'm not one for radically changing my life or trying entirely new things.  While I fantasize about tropical vacations to places like Cozumel or Aruba, I haven't actually booked one yet. I prefer the familiar and comfortable, even if that means sometimes ending up in the wrong building after a long walk across campus in the Texas heat!","I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning and organization.  Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't my strong suit. Though I do mention wanting to work out and lose weight, I haven't mapped out a structured plan to make that happen. Procrastination is more my style!","While I enjoy the company of my family and close friends, large social gatherings tend to drain me. My interactions with the ""jerk"" library employee and the ""mean lady at the front desk"" definitely left me feeling irritated and frustrated, confirming my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings.","Conflicts definitely make me uncomfortable.  My disagreement with the unhelpful library worker resulted in me simply taking my problem elsewhere.  While I value respecting others' beliefs (like my roommate's Mormon faith), direct confrontation isn't my go-to approach.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions. The incident where I nearly passed out from the heat and the worry about the upcoming anniversary of September 11th illustrate my tendency towards heightened emotional reactivity. Although I don’t have specific coping strategies laid out, my frequent mentions of my worries throughout the essay show I am introspective about these feelings.",y,n,y,n,y
1521,"I did try something new recently: going to Chipotle.  I'd never been before, and the burrito was unexpectedly large. While I messed up the order (my fault for not understanding the menu!), it wasn't a completely negative experience. I'll try it again, knowing what to order this time.  It showed me I'm willing to try new places, even if the first attempt isn't perfect.","I've struggled to stay on top of my college studies.  I set a goal to keep up with all my classes, but I've already fallen behind.  Time management isn't my strong suit, and I haven't found effective strategies to stay focused. It's frustrating to fall behind, but I know I need to buckle down and concentrate more.","Going to Dave Matthews Band concerts was energizing. The atmosphere, the music, the shared excitement with other fans—it was exhilarating.  Quiet evenings at home with friends playing music can be nice, but large, exciting crowds are where I truly thrive socially. Conversely, I found driving home in the rain, alone, rather draining.","I didn't explicitly state a disagreement in the essay but there's an implicit one with Chipotle's menu/staff. I handled it by not eating much of the burrito and chalking it up to my own misunderstanding. I wasn't confrontational; my priority is simple resolution, learning from mistakes, and avoiding major conflicts. My tendency is to avoid confrontation when possible.","Driving four hours in the rain, stressed about falling behind in college, and the anxiety about my girlfriend being far away really got to me.  Initially, I just kept driving, but then I talked to friends online late at night, to work through the tension. That seemed to help. I definitely rely on talking things out as a coping mechanism.",y,n,n,n,y

While I’m open to learning new things related to my studies, I don't actively seek out novel experiences for the sake of it.","I'm trying to be more organized in college. Managing my time is a constant challenge, but I'm working on it. I try to break down big assignments into smaller, manageable chunks.  Staying on top of things is important to me, and I’m pretty diligent about keeping up with my responsibilities, even if it sometimes means sacrificing other things.","I enjoy social interaction, but I find it energizing only when it involves close friends. Large groups or superficial conversations tend to drain me.  I need plenty of downtime to recharge after social events. It’s more quality over quantity for me when it comes to friendships.","Disagreements are tough.  I tend to avoid direct conflict, but when I have to address a difference of opinion, I try to be respectful and focus on finding common ground, even if it means compromising on some points.  My priority is avoiding making things worse, even if it means suppressing my own feelings somewhat.","Stress and anxiety are definitely familiar feelings for me, especially with the pressures of college.  When it gets overwhelming, I tend to get irritable and focused on the problem, which probably isn't the most productive strategy.  I do try to find ways to alleviate the stress like finding something else to do, but I know I could use more strategies to manage things better.",n,y,y,n,y
1523,"I’m not one for drastically new experiences.  While I wouldn't say I’m resistant to trying new things, I generally prefer familiar activities and environments.  The thought of something completely novel tends to make me feel a bit uncomfortable; I find comfort in routine.  The essay reflects that I have little to say about any new experiences.","I’m not a highly organized person.  Deadlines aren’t something I actively plan for; I tend to just do things when they need to be done, without much proactive scheduling or planning. The essay showcases a lack of preparation for a school assignment, highlighting my less than conscientious approach.","Social situations drain me, especially ones that require small talk or prolonged interaction with strangers.  The experience of having to think of something to say to someone I don't know, as mentioned in the essay, perfectly captures that feeling of discomfort and exhaustion. I would prefer to avoid that.","I try to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I might express my viewpoint politely, but I prioritize avoiding upsetting anyone.  The essay reflects an avoidance of directly challenging situations; even in this writing prompt, a lack of strong opinions or clear ideas is evident.","I don't experience high levels of stress or anxiety frequently, though moments of boredom or uncertainty might leave me feeling a bit listless.

1524,"I don't usually seek out new experiences; I prefer the familiar.  September 11th, however, forced me to confront a new and horrific reality. While I didn't actively *choose* this experience, the intense emotions and the subsequent memorials were profoundly impactful, leaving me with a deepened sense of national pride and a stronger appreciation for my loved ones.  It wasn't a ""fun"" new experience, but it was undeniably transformative.","I'm not particularly organized or driven.  While I attended the memorials,  I didn't plan meticulously or set specific goals related to my participation. My actions that day were more reactive than proactive, driven by emotion rather than structured planning or sustained effort. The experience itself, however, was deeply rewarding in an emotional, rather than achievement-based, sense.","Large, energetic social gatherings aren't really my thing. The memorial at the Capitol, while emotionally charged and involving many people, felt different; the shared grief and patriotism created a sense of unity rather than draining me. The focused nature of the event, centered around a shared tragedy, may have made it less overwhelming than a typical social interaction.  It reaffirmed my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings with close friends.","The student who made the insensitive comment in class deeply upset me. I didn't engage in a direct confrontation; I was too overwhelmed by the day's events. My priority was processing my own emotions rather than engaging in conflict. I believe in expressing my feelings but choose my moments carefully, and this wasn't the time or place for it.","September 11th was incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was outrage and sadness. Attending the memorials helped manage my emotions; the shared grief and collective expression of patriotism provided a sense of comfort and community. It was cathartic and affirming, a constructive way to process the trauma of the day.",n,n,n,n,y

It was a complete departure from my usual routine, motivated by a desire to try something physically and mentally challenging, and something different from my usual workout routine. I'm enjoying the discipline and the physical exertion, even though I find some of the moves tricky!","I've been trying to create a consistent workout and Tae Kwon Do schedule.  My approach has been more trial-and-error; I haven't been strict with it and my schedule has changed and will continue to change as my interests change and evolve. The challenge is balancing my multiple interests, and the reward is the satisfaction of engaging in them all, even if my schedule is a bit chaotic.","Being around my Tae Kwon Do classmates energizes me. The shared activity, the supportive atmosphere, and the friendly banter all contribute to a positive experience.  On the other hand, large, unstructured social gatherings can leave me feeling drained – I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","I’m not very good at agreeing with people. I often find myself disagreeing with others, and I usually handle it by expressing my disagreement directly, even if it means causing conflict.  My priority is honesty. Sometimes I do agree, it depends on the circumstances!","When I get stressed, I tend to become somewhat argumentative and sarcastic; it's my way of dealing with pressure. I try to manage my emotions by shifting my focus to a physical activity like working out, or thinking through the situation logically. I try not to act out and hurt my friends or family.",y,n,y,n,n
1526,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  My dad's train obsession is a prime example of something I found tedious, even though it was a new experience for me. I went along with it because family, but I prefer the familiar and predictable.  Novelty isn’t something that excites me.","I'm pretty goal-oriented, especially when it comes to things I care about, like my volleyball team.  I wouldn't say I'm highly organized, but I try to stay committed by simply showing up and participating consistently.  The challenge is always maintaining motivation outside of actual gameplay. I have a hard time with those tasks outside of active enjoyment, like typing, even though I know that improving those skills would eventually help.","Social situations, generally, drain me.  That trip with my Dad to ride the steam train felt like a big waste of time.  Quiet time is what I crave; being surrounded by people for long periods of time simply isn't my cup of tea. I am pretty introverted and prefer my own company to large groups.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  I'd rather keep the peace, sometimes to my detriment.  If I'm pushed to deal with a conflict, it’s important for me that everyone feels listened to, but I'm not necessarily good at advocating for my own opinions during a confrontation.","I tend to get stressed easily.  Things like that annoying ticking clock, or even my sister's book, can cause irritation. Staying up late and not stretching my arm enough to avoid pain are clear examples of this behavior. My coping mechanisms aren't the healthiest.  I often just let things get to me instead of taking the initiative to deal with the underlying issues.",n,y,n,n,n
1527,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  While I went to UT Austin despite others advising against it, that was more of a rebellious act driven by a desire to prove people wrong than a genuine interest in exploring something unfamiliar.  The experience hasn't exactly changed my perspective, either; I'm already thinking about leaving.","I'm not the most organized person. My Tae Bo workouts are a way to manage stress, not a structured goal I pursue with planning.  I don’t really have strategies for time management, honestly.  My life often feels like it's going in the wrong direction.","Working out with my Tae Bo tape is my favorite way to recharge, which is a solitary activity. Although I value my relationship with my boyfriend, even that can be draining when he repeats ""I love you"" too much. Social interactions are generally exhausting.","I tend to internalize conflict.  I get caught up thinking about others' behaviors, even if it's my roommate or my friends. I often find myself judging others but simultaneously doubting those judgments. I struggle with voicing my disagreement, and tend to overthink things.","I’m highly susceptible to stress and anxiety. Losing my first draft of this essay triggered my anxiety and negativity immediately. My initial response is often self-doubt and negativity, which I combat with exercise, but I frequently worry about my future and where I'm headed.",n,n,y,n,y
1528,"I entered a modeling contest on a whim.  I'd never considered myself a model, but the chance to win money, potentially escape my current financial woes, and even leave Texas appealed to me.  It was a bit terrifying, stepping outside my comfort zone, but ultimately thrilling and exciting. I hope it will lead to something bigger and better.","Getting into the psychology program requires a lot of effort;  I'm trying to improve my grades to get in.  It's been a struggle balancing work, school, and financial stress. I've tried using planners and to-do lists, but honestly, I'm not very good at it.  The challenge is immense, but I'm motivated by the prospect of finally pursuing my degree.","Going to the modeling contest was a bit of a mixed bag. While I enjoyed the experience and excitement of the competition, the interactions with other contestants left me feeling somewhat drained afterward. It confirmed my preference for smaller, more intimate social gatherings over large, crowded events.","I'm constantly annoyed by my roommates' behavior.  Yoshi owes me money, and Stephanie's messiness is frustrating.  I avoid direct confrontation, usually just expressing my annoyance passively or complaining to others, because it’s too much work to deal with. Resolving these issues feels like a huge hassle, and my priorities tend to be getting through these situations with the least amount of effort.","The financial anxieties of supporting myself have been overwhelming.  My initial response is usually panic, followed by a sense of helplessness. To cope, I sometimes focus on escapist strategies like the modeling contest and daydreams of winning the lottery.  I’m also considering unorthodox solutions, like the anesthetic testing, which are a sign of my stress and desperation.",y,y,y,n,y
1529,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I prefer familiar routines.  Trying new things feels overwhelming and anxiety-inducing.  The thought of stepping outside my comfort zone is stressful, so I tend to stick to what I know. Even when I did try something new, like starting university, the experience was largely defined by its difficulties rather than the novelty itself.","I feel a strong pressure to achieve high grades to get into my desired program, so I try to manage my time effectively.  However, I find it difficult to maintain consistency. My schedule feels overcrowded, and even small setbacks derail my productivity. The relentless pressure feels more challenging than rewarding.  It’s a struggle, honestly.","Social interactions tend to drain my energy; I prefer smaller gatherings or quiet time alone.  The university campus with its constant activity and socializing is extremely tiring. The work environment is no exception; I feel uncomfortable with the relaxed atmosphere and lack of focus. I find that I prefer to be working than socializing, but even this is draining.","I generally avoid conflict.  If disagreements arise, I tend to internalize them rather than confront the other person directly.  Maintaining a harmonious relationship isn't always possible but I prioritize avoiding any direct confrontation, which leads to me feeling resentful sometimes.","I frequently feel overwhelmed and anxious, especially about academics and the many demands of university life. My initial response to stress is often avoidance, but I try to distract myself through work.  However, this often leads to further stress and anxiety, creating a cycle of negative feelings.",n,n,n,n,y
1530,"I'm not one for drastically new experiences.  The essay shows my comfort with familiar things (like Harry Potter),  and while I tried a weird food combination (brisket, rice, and kimchi), it wasn't a huge leap outside my typical preferences. Novelty doesn't really drive me, I prefer the familiar and comfortable.","I struggle with sustained effort and long-term goals. My essay reveals my procrastination – I put off studying, prioritizing Harry Potter instead.  I don’t have strong systems for time management.  Staying committed is definitely a challenge for me, as evidenced by my frequent digressions and the overall disorganization of my writing.","Large social gatherings drain me. The essay reflects this; the concert, while enjoyable initially, led to feelings of being overwhelmed (""so humid and I felt so sticky""). I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions or alone time to recharge, as opposed to large social events.","I generally avoid conflict. The essay doesn't detail any specific disagreements, but my tendency to be agreeable is evident in my lack of direct confrontation or assertiveness in expressing my needs.  I'd rather avoid upsetting others than directly address a problem, even if it means internalizing frustration.","I get easily overwhelmed and frustrated. The essay shows this – the stress of studying, the annoyance at the length of the writing assignment, and the impatience exhibited at the end are clear signs. My emotional regulation isn't always great, leading to procrastination, distraction, and emotional swings as seen in the fluctuations of my mood throughout the essay.",n,n,n,y,n
1531,"I'm not one for radically new experiences. My dorm room, cozy and familiar, is my safe haven.  I prefer the comfort of routine, though I did try speed typing once, and the masochistic thrill of it was strangely satisfying. It’s certainly not something I’d regularly seek out, but I did find a strange sort of enjoyment in it.","I’m pretty disorganized and don’t excel at long-term goals. While I *want* to run, the willpower isn't there. My dieting has been far easier than exercising because it doesn't require the sustained effort.  Honestly, I prefer quick gratification, even if it means I'm not reaching my full potential in other aspects of life.",Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained.  My friend bailing on me—that’s a prime example.  Large groups and constant engagement are overwhelming; I really value my quiet time in my cozy dorm room.  I am much happier on my own than with others.,"Disagreements are difficult, leading to conflict. I'm very much a ""my way or the highway"" kind of person, and while I value autonomy for myself, I don't always extend that same value to others.  My roommate's lack of strong political stances irritates me—we're very different.","Stress and anxiety hit me hard.  The pressure of college, of not being ""special"" enough, causes significant anxiety and feelings of inferiority.  I cope by retreating into my room.  It’s overwhelming to think that everyone else might be smarter or better than me in some way.",y,n,n,n,y
1532,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  The essay reflects a fear of stepping outside my comfort zone, which is why I've mostly stayed within familiar patterns.  Even the idea of trying something new feels overwhelming and risky, leading to avoidance.  I'd rather stick to what I know, even if it's not particularly fulfilling.","I haven't had a long-term goal that required sustained effort recently. My essay shows a lack of motivation and a history of coasting on natural abilities, rather than actively pursuing goals.  The thought of committing to something and staying on track seems daunting; I'm more prone to procrastination and a lack of structured planning.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  The essay indicates a fear of judgment and a belief that people are trying to distance themselves. I’m sensitive to perceived rejection and the idea of being seen as a ""goofy dork"" further reduces my desire for social engagement.  I crave genuine connection but find the effort overwhelming and anxiety-inducing.","Disagreements are difficult for me. My essay highlights a tendency to avoid conflict and a fear of negative judgment. I'm more likely to withdraw or internalize my feelings than directly confront someone. This isn't about being uncaring; it's rooted in a fear of damaging relationships and a low self-esteem.  I believe my priorities are self-preservation and maintaining the status quo, even if that means avoiding confrontation.","My throat hurting from smoking is a symptom of this. Stress and anxiety are very frequent feelings for me.  My immediate response is often self-criticism and worry, as demonstrated in my writing.  I tend to dwell on my perceived shortcomings and lack of self-confidence, amplifying negative feelings. My approach to dealing with these emotions is to isolate myself and avoid situations that might exacerbate my anxiety.",n,n,n,n,y
1533,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  My focus has been on navigating this new chapter of college and figuring out my future, which feels overwhelming enough.  While I appreciate diverse perspectives, I tend to stick with what I know and feel comfortable with. The thought of trying something drastically different right now feels a bit daunting.","I've always been very goal-oriented and focused.  Even though I'm uncertain about my long-term goals right now, I'm still managing my studies diligently.  I create detailed to-do lists and prioritize tasks effectively to ensure that I meet my academic deadlines. My strong work ethic helps me stay committed, even when feeling lost about the bigger picture. The uncertainty about my future is challenging, but the satisfaction of completing tasks keeps me going.","Social interactions are usually draining for me.  I enjoy time alone and with a select few close friends. The loudness of my roommate and her boyfriend, especially now that I'm single, highlights my preference for quieter, more intimate settings.  My recent breakup emphasized my need for solitude and reflection, reinforcing my introverted nature.","I generally strive to be agreeable and understanding, even in disagreements. When I disagree with someone, I try to listen to their perspective before expressing my own, prioritizing mutual understanding over winning an argument.  I aim for calm discussion and compromise, believing that respectful communication is key to resolving conflicts.","I'm generally pretty calm and don't experience excessive anxiety. However, the uncertainty surrounding my future and the recent breakup initially caused some stress.  I managed my emotions by talking to my brother, who offers great support. I also find comfort in my studies and spending time with my close friends. These strategies helped me manage my feelings and approach the situation constructively.",n,y,n,y,n
1534,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty content with my routine.  The only time I tried something wildly different was when I reluctantly tried rugby. I was motivated by pressure from friends and a desire to fit in, and honestly, it was pretty brutal. Afterward, I was sore, but I did gain some appreciation for the teamwork aspect.","I'm not exactly known for my planning skills.  I set goals, like finishing this assignment, but keeping to a schedule or managing my time effectively isn’t my strong suit.  My strategies mostly involve last-minute cramming and hoping for the best. The challenges are numerous—procrastination, mainly—but the reward is that sense of relief when I finally finish something.","Being around a lot of people in a loud, energetic environment, like a rugby game or a crowded bar, generally energizes me.  Small talk drains me; I need genuine connections.  I think I thrive in environments where there's a sense of shared purpose or camaraderie, and that's what makes social interactions fulfilling.","Disagreements are something I generally avoid.  If a conflict arises, I tend to withdraw or try to find a way to agree, even if I don't completely agree internally. I prioritize avoiding confrontation; it's simpler to just go along with things even if I don't really agree with them.","Stress and anxiety are pretty common for me.  My initial response is often to avoid the stressor, like skipping classes or postponing homework. To manage, I sometimes distract myself with things like smoking or hanging out with my friends. However, this doesn't always resolve the underlying anxiety; I really need to find more constructive ways to handle my stress.",n,n,y,n,y
1535,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  Moving to Austin for college was a big change, but mostly it felt like an extension of things I already knew – like being on a dance team, but in a new setting. The new environment is exciting, but honestly, I miss the familiarity of my old life and my dance team back in Blinn.","I’m not the most organized person; my apartment is a disaster zone.  Setting and achieving goals isn’t really my strong point. The dance team tryouts are looming, and I'm debating whether the effort is worth it, given my less-than-stellar organizational skills and tendency to avoid disappointment by not caring too much in the first place. I tend to procrastinate, and it would probably be easier to give up than try and fail.","Being around my close friends is definitely energizing.  We're constantly busy with homework and campus activities.  But sometimes, like when I'm alone in my apartment, the quiet can be draining.  Even with my friends, I can get exhausted from needing constant interaction.","I usually try to avoid conflict, but I can get into disagreements, especially with my boyfriend, who doesn’t get along with one of my friends. I just hang out with him anyway, because I don’t feel obligated to clear everything with my boyfriend. I mostly prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means keeping others happy.","I definitely get stressed and anxious easily. My boyfriend’s lack of communication, my upcoming dance tryouts, and my dad's job loss all create a lot of anxiety.  I initially tend to worry and overthink, but I try to focus on coping mechanisms. Hanging out with my best friends helps, as does thinking about the positive aspects of the situation, like my dad's new business.",n,n,y,y,y

It was a departure from my usual routine, and while initially hesitant about the competitive aspect, the whole experience felt surprisingly energizing and fun.  I discovered a hidden talent for word games, and it helped me connect with my friends in a new way. The fun and friendly competition helped ease my college stress.","Getting my college presentation done is a huge goal. I've procrastinated horribly,  but I'm trying to manage my time better by breaking down the assignment into smaller, manageable tasks. It's challenging to stay motivated when I'm nervous about the topic, but my competitive nature helps push me through. The reward will be the satisfaction of completing a difficult task and potentially getting my dream job at MTV.","Spending time with my family is incredibly energizing.  Their unwavering support and love fill me up. Conversely, the pressure of this upcoming presentation and fear of being judged is draining.  Being with supportive people who love me gives me more energy. I know that feeling nervous before presentations is something that I have to work on.","I haven't had many major disagreements lately, but my family is supportive and understanding, which helps. I am a very competitive person but also very compassionate. This makes it hard because I can become very defensive when I am losing or someone is disagreeing with me. I need to work on being more receptive and agreeable, not just aggressive.","The upcoming presentation is causing significant stress and anxiety. My initial reaction is procrastination, but I’m trying to combat that by breaking it into smaller chunks and making time to work on it to feel less overwhelmed.  Talking to my supportive family and friends helps ground me, and helps me feel less stressed.",y,y,y,y,n

I get a sense of accomplishment just thinking about investigating it further someday, even if I don't actually get around to it.  The process of questioning and wondering provides a sense of productive inquisitiveness.","I aim to be organized, but sometimes I falter.  My financial situation is a big goal right now; I'm working on getting that sorted by going to the student services building to figure out my loan.  Procrastination can be a struggle, but I do try to stick to my commitments eventually, even if it takes longer than planned. My perfectionism makes the process much more stressful than it needs to be.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. I enjoy the company of close friends and my roommate, Joseph, much more.  Deep conversations feel more fulfilling than bustling parties. I tend to prefer quieter, more intimate settings to recharge my energy.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid conflict, but when I have to address it, my main priority is fairness.  I try to understand the other person's perspective even if I don't necessarily agree with them. I avoid confrontation as much as possible.","Stress manifests as worry in my life. I worry excessively, often about things I can't control.  When I feel overwhelmed, I try to distract myself—sometimes by writing or ranting, as I did here.  It’s a coping mechanism for my anxieties and helps me manage my emotions.",y,y,y,n,y

I'm motivated to succeed in my classes and am making an effort to balance my studies with going out.  My devotional time is something I prioritize, even when tired. It helps keep me grounded and focused, but sometimes I struggle to stay on track with assignments.","Going to the KA house tonight is a good example. I crave social interaction with my friends, especially Justin, but sometimes, it leaves me feeling drained. This shows me I need a balance between social interaction and alone time to recharge.  Spending time with my grandmother and my close friends fills me with energy.","I'm not one to readily engage in conflict. With Bryan, while things seem to be going well, I'm not completely open and willing to confront challenges or disagreements that might arise. I tend to avoid direct confrontation, hoping things work out naturally.","The stress of being away from home and starting college is huge.

I'm enjoying the present moment of college life.  My focus is more on having fun and meeting people than on long-term planning or structured effort. I haven't really planned my future out, or even my next semester.","Fraternity parties are amazing. The energy is infectious, and I love being surrounded by people. The free alcohol and lack of repercussions definitely contribute to the positive feeling, but mainly it’s the social connection with a large group of people. It makes me feel popular and happy, and fuels my desire to keep going out.","I haven’t had any major disagreements with anyone yet, thankfully. If a disagreement were to arise, I'd probably avoid direct conflict and hope it resolves itself, or perhaps just agree to disagree, prioritizing my desire to keep things peaceful and harmonious.","I don't experience stress or anxiety very often.

I meticulously plan my days and weeks, using to-do lists and scheduling apps to manage my time effectively.

I initially tried to manage my time meticulously, using planners and to-do lists, but my procrastination, noted in the essay, shows my struggles with this. Ultimately, I learned that flexibility and occasional breaks were necessary to stay motivated and avoid burnout.  The rewarding part was connecting with friends in classes, despite the lack of free time.",Spending time with my friend Jenny always energizes me.

I skipped class today because I felt sick, which definitely wasn't ideal.  I generally aim to do well in school, but sometimes it's a struggle to balance social life, my health (which seems to be failing me lately!), and academics. My goal this semester is to pass my classes, and I'm trying, even if it's not always pretty.","Last night was fun, but it left me feeling pretty drained today.

1546,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I tend to stick to what's familiar and comfortable.  The idea of trying something completely new fills me with anxiety,  honestly.  I'd rather stay in my routine.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals.  My attention span is short, and I get easily sidetracked.  I often procrastinate until the last minute, which adds to my stress and makes things much harder than they need to be.  It's a constant struggle.","Large social gatherings drain my energy.  I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I already know well.  Overwhelming social situations leave me feeling exhausted and anxious, leading me to withdraw and recharge in solitude.","I try to avoid conflict whenever possible.  If I disagree with someone, I often keep quiet to avoid confrontation. While I value harmony, sometimes this means I don't express my own needs or opinions effectively.","I experience anxiety frequently, especially in situations that feel uncertain or overwhelming.  My initial response is often to worry and overthink. However, I try to distract myself with small activities or just allow myself to feel the anxiety rather than fight it.",n,n,n,y,y
1547,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  My life feels pretty stuck in a rut, honestly. I mostly just dwell on the same old things—my classes, the guys I shouldn't be interested in, and my worries.  Maybe someday I'll be adventurous, but right now, sticking to the familiar is all I can manage.","I've definitely struggled with setting and achieving long-term goals.  School is a prime example.  I *want* to be an optometrist, but I can't seem to get myself to study. I lack the discipline to prioritize my schoolwork over my other preoccupations.  The biggest challenge is my inability to focus and overcome my procrastination. Any reward feels so far off it's hard to stay motivated.","Being around large groups of people completely drains me.  I prefer smaller, intimate settings with people I'm close to. Even then, my constant worrying and anxieties can make social interactions exhausting. It is always better to talk to people I already have relationships with, rather than trying to meet new people, and the anxiety of potentially making new friends weighs me down when I think about doing it. The draining interactions come when I am trying to be outgoing and act like I am fine with being around others when in reality I am internally screaming at myself.","Disagreements are tough. I tend to avoid conflict, even if I strongly disagree with someone. I often prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means compromising my own feelings. It's not that I'm a pushover, but confrontation is emotionally draining, and avoiding it feels less stressful. I prioritize harmony over conflict and will go out of my way to avoid confrontation, even if it will hurt me in the long run.","Stress and anxiety are constant companions.  My initial response is usually to overthink and worry about everything. I sometimes isolate myself, but I also try to distract myself with things I enjoy, though it often just leads me down a spiral of negative thoughts. Eventually, I talk to friends and family about my struggles, as they help to take some of that weight off my chest, and also pray to God for help.",y,n,y,y,y
1548,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  My essay shows I'm content with my routine, my relationship with Trent, and my plans for the future. The idea of attending UT is a big change, but it's more of a logical next step towards a stable career in nursing rather than a wild, spontaneous adventure.  I prefer familiarity and predictability.","Getting into UT and succeeding in nursing school is a huge goal requiring sustained effort. I'm planning my experiments carefully, and I'm thinking about how to organize my time effectively. While I'm not overly meticulous in my essay, the mention of planning and scheduling shows some effort towards organization.  I'm motivated by the desire for a secure future with Trent and a family, which pushes me to stay committed to my studies despite feeling overwhelmed at times.","The essay reveals I'm not particularly outgoing. My social interactions seem to be mostly limited to Trent and my coworker.  Spending time with Trent energizes me; it's a comforting and familiar connection.  Large social gatherings or unfamiliar social situations probably leave me feeling drained; the essay doesn't mention any such situations. I find comfort and fulfillment in close, intimate relationships.","I value my relationships. My relationship with Trent is a central theme in my writing.  Disagreements are not explicitly discussed, suggesting that I likely prioritize harmony and avoid conflict.  My desire for a future with Trent and a family highlights a cooperative and agreeable nature.  I probably try to find common ground and avoid confrontation in resolving disputes.","Starting college has caused me anxiety, as mentioned in my essay.  My initial response to stress is likely worry and possibly some self-doubt. I manage stress through planning and focusing on my long-term goals (marriage, family, nursing career).  The essay also shows a tendency to focus on the negative aspects of my life, such as my weight and my father's relationship with me.",n,y,n,y,n
1549,"I'm not one for radically new experiences.  While I value my friendships and being around people I know, I haven't sought out drastically different activities or environments lately. My focus has been more internal, working through some emotional complexities and rediscovering myself after a difficult breakup.  The process of healing and self-reflection has been a sort of ""new"" experience in its own right.","I wouldn't say I'm incredibly organized or methodical.  The breakup and its aftermath haven't been conducive to careful planning or long-term goal setting.  My focus has been on immediate emotional well-being and navigating a complex relationship shift, so I've prioritized emotional healing over strictly structured time management. My strategies have been more intuitive than rigidly planned.","Large social gatherings generally leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. The most memorable recent social experience has been spending time with my ex-boyfriend as we transition to friendship.  It’s been emotionally intense but revealing about my need for genuine connection and emotional support. It's helped me clarify what I want and don't want in a relationship.","Disagreements are tough for me. My instinct is to avoid open conflict. With my ex-boyfriend, the disagreements centered around his commitment issues and inconsistent behavior.  My priority was to maintain a civil relationship and retain our friendship, so I focused on compassionate communication, even when he wasn't meeting my needs or expectations.  This highlights a desire for harmony that occasionally overlooks the need for assertiveness.","The breakup has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking. Initially, I experienced intense emotional ups and downs. To manage this, I relied on my support network and allowed myself to process my emotions without judgment.  Focusing on self-care, maintaining a healthy diet and some exercise helped restore a sense of normalcy and manage my emotional responses constructively.",y,n,n,n,n
1550,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  The essay shows I'm more comfortable in familiar settings and activities.  Playing volleyball again after a couple of years was a small step outside my usual routine, spurred more by the opportunity to socialize than a desire for novelty.  It felt alright, not particularly remarkable.","Getting a 4.0 GPA to get into business school is a huge goal for me, one that requires a lot of consistent effort. I plan to achieve this through effective time management and prioritizing my studies. Although, as the essay demonstrates, I sometimes get sidetracked,  the desire for academic success is a strong motivator.  The challenge is maintaining focus amidst distractions and social pressures.","The essay shows how I spent time with friends in a somewhat crowded environment.  While it wasn’t draining per se, it didn't particularly energize me either. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.  Large social gatherings can feel overwhelming, leading me to seek quieter moments of reflection; a preference clearly exhibited in my writing.","Disagreements aren’t something I readily engage with or address directly in the essay. When conflict arises,  I tend to avoid confrontation;  my priority is minimizing friction rather than directly resolving issues.  I value harmonious relationships and would rather let things slide than create tension.","My anxieties about my girlfriend and academic performance are evident in the essay. My immediate response to stress is often introspection and rumination. I try to cope by focusing on tasks I can control, like studying, but my emotions and worries clearly impact my overall state of mind, as reflected in the tone of my writing.",n,y,n,n,y
1551,"I tried rowing, something completely outside my comfort zone.  I was motivated by a desire to challenge myself physically and join a team, and despite initial fear, I found it empowering.  I felt a mix of exhaustion and exhilaration afterwards – something I enjoyed.","I set a goal of making the rowing team, requiring consistent training. I scheduled practices around my classes and other commitments, using a planner to stay organized.  While fatigue was a challenge, the reward of progress kept me committed. I found the process challenging but fulfilling in improving my physical fitness, even if I didn't make the team.","A social experience that energized me was spending time with Otto, despite all of my anxieties about this assignment. I found the exchange fulfilling because the connection felt authentic and supportive. I need regular interaction with close friends, even if those interactions are sometimes difficult.","I had a disagreement with Vivek about his confession of love. I reacted badly and angrily, prioritizing my immediate emotional comfort over his feelings.  While I regret this, it caused conflict and the eventual change in our friendship.","When my writing assignment was lost due to a computer error, I felt intense stress and frustration. My initial response was anger, but I channeled that into finishing the assignment. I handled it poorly but did handle it eventually and I continued, reminding myself of the importance of completing it.",n,y,y,y,y

The whole frat scene is foreign to me, and even my close high school friends seem distant.  While I understand the importance of meeting new people, the experience has been more jarring than anything.","I wouldn’t say I’m the most organized person.  Big decisions, like choosing a fraternity, feel incredibly overwhelming, and I struggle with managing my time effectively.  I have goals, but keeping focused on them amidst the chaos of college life is tough.  The pressure of making significant life choices right now is definitely the biggest challenge I face.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.  College has been a very different social experience than my high school life. The lack of connection with old friends and the strangeness of meeting new ones definitely leave me feeling exhausted more often than energized.   I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings rather than large, boisterous parties.","I find myself disagreeing with people frequently, particularly Joshua, who’s incredibly judgmental.  Dealing with conflict is difficult; I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  I prioritize maintaining a sense of inner peace over resolving conflicts aggressively, even if it means internalizing my frustrations.","I get stressed and anxious easily. The uncertainty of college, the changing dynamics with friends, and the pressure to make important decisions all contribute to this.

The last ""new"" thing I did was probably trying a new coffee shop – and even that was more out of convenience than a thirst for the unknown.","I have a lot of things I *should* be doing: studying, working, going to the gym. But keeping up with everything is tough. I struggle with procrastination. I make to-do lists, but honestly, sticking to them isn't a strength of mine.  I often prioritize what feels most urgent or emotionally appealing, which isn't always the most productive. The emotional turmoil of my relationship with Ben makes it even harder.","Social situations generally drain me, especially when I'm feeling stressed.  Like now, with my relationship with Ben hanging in the balance, being around people just feels overwhelming.  I value close, intimate connections, not large social gatherings.","I don't always handle disagreements well. When I'm stressed or insecure—like I am now because of Ben—my anxiety makes me avoid confrontation. I tend to internalize things rather than openly communicate my feelings. My priority is to avoid further conflict, even if it means I don't fully express myself.",I'm constantly worried about Ben. My anxieties about my relationship make it hard to focus on anything else.

My focus is usually on things I already know and enjoy, like getting ready for my wedding or focusing on my relationships (or lack thereof). The thought of trying something completely outside my comfort zone doesn't really appeal to me;  I prefer familiarity and things that reinforce my existing beliefs about myself and how I deserve to be treated.","I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning. When my mom got sick, things got chaotic, and my approach was more reactive than proactive.  While I did help her, it was more about immediate needs and less about long-term strategies. I prioritize what feels important in the moment.  Sustained effort isn't really my style;  I am more interested in immediate gratification.","Social situations can be either incredibly energizing or completely draining, depending on how much attention I receive.  Being the center of attention, feeling admired and treated like a princess, is invigorating.  If I'm ignored or not treated as I think I deserve, I quickly become drained and resentful. It's all about the validation I receive.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I don't tend to back down from my beliefs about how I deserve to be treated. If someone disagrees with me on that, conflict is inevitable. My priority is ensuring my needs are met, even if it means the other person's feelings are hurt.  Compromise is less important than asserting what I see as my right to be treated like a princess.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions. When overwhelmed (like with my mom's illness and packing), I tend to become emotionally volatile.  My initial response might be anger or resentment, but I ultimately try to manage it by focusing on the positive aspects of the situation—the attention I'm getting from caring for my mother—and letting others take care of things. My feelings are my reality, and getting upset is a common emotion.",y,n,y,n,y

I guess joining the sorority itself was a bit out of the ordinary for my family, and I am proud of that. That’s definitely something new for my family and I.","Honestly, balancing school, my sorority, and my budding social life has been a challenge. I haven’t been super organized. My goal of making it through pledge week was a big commitment, and while I powered through, I don’t think I had the best time management. It was rewarding to achieve, but stressful!","Being in a sorority has been a great social experience;  I love being around people I am close to and feel like I really fit in. I feel energized when we hang out, when I am engaged, and can share with them what is going on in my life. It’s reaffirmed how much I value strong friendships and close relationships.","I try to be understanding, even when I disagree.  My parents’ lack of support with sorority dues has been tough, but I'm trying to communicate my feelings and find a compromise.  It’s important to me that they understand my happiness, and I’ll always try to work things out without conflict.","The stress of college, my sorority fees, and not having my own computer have gotten to me. I can be more anxious and stressed than I’d like, but my friends and the college environment really help me.  I've found that working out and establishing a new diet helps keep things in check.  I’m usually optimistic, but some days, the worries really weigh on me.",n,n,y,y,n

For example, I tried smoking cigars and cigarettes once out of curiosity, wanting to understand what the experience was like. While I decided it wasn't for me (mostly due to my asthma), I don't regret trying it; it helped me understand my own preferences and limits better. I'm not one to get caught up in the details. I just do things and see what happens.  I'm pretty open to trying new things, though I'm not the most introspective person.","Maintaining good grades in school has always been a priority. It required consistent effort, planning, and prioritizing schoolwork over other activities.  Time management wasn't usually a problem; I naturally prioritize schoolwork, but I needed discipline to balance school with my budding social life this last year. The most rewarding part was graduating in the top 2% of my class; it demonstrated my commitment and the value I place on hard work.","I generally prefer smaller, more intimate social gatherings. Large parties, for example, leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed, rather than energized.  My understanding of myself suggests that I need downtime to recharge after interactions, so I tend to keep my social calendar somewhat moderate.  I'm comfortable being alone and tend to have an easy-going nature; that doesn't mean that I'm not friendly but I'm more of a listener than a talker.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. When disagreements arise, I often prioritize maintaining harmony over proving my point. My tendency is to let others have their way, even if I think they're wrong.  I believe that making others happy is more important than forcing my opinion on them. However, this has led to times where I may appear passive.","I don't tend to get overly stressed or anxious; I've always had the ability to let things go fairly easily. I don't get caught up in the specifics, and tend to let things happen without getting too worked up about them.

However, I did manage to pick out an outfit for a party, which took a surprising 35 minutes. I needed to look good, and I'm happy with how that turned out. The experience was more about self-expression than rigorous planning or self-discipline.","Going to the fraternity party was definitely an energizing experience.  The interaction was fun, although superficial, and even though I questioned their motives, the lively atmosphere and the attention were enjoyable. It confirmed my preference for social settings where I can engage in lighthearted conversation and enjoy the company of others without demanding deep connections.","I don't always agree with people, especially the frat boys, and I can be rather blunt. There's a level of playful antagonism in my interaction with them, and though I'm certainly not always agreeable, I do believe they are worth the interaction as they're entertaining in their own way. I don't necessarily prioritize resolving conflict, but rather enjoy the playful back-and-forth dynamic.","I don't tend to get stressed or anxious easily; I’m generally laid-back. The only time I felt any sense of apprehension was wondering if the frat boys genuinely wanted to talk to me or if there were ulterior motives. However, that only served as a minor curiosity, and I quickly shrugged it off. My response was more about amusement and observation, rather than internal distress.",y,n,y,n,n

I'm trying to use a planner and break down big assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. It's challenging to stay focused, but the reward of feeling more in control of my time is worth the effort.  The feeling of accomplishment when I complete a task on time is extremely rewarding.","Hearing the girls laughing in the hallway, and anticipating a night out at the club, really energizes me.  Being around people, the social energy, and the excitement of new experiences are what make these interactions so fulfilling.

I struggled with time management, often procrastinating. I employed strategies like breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, but I still fell behind schedule. It was rewarding to complete the project, but stressful and challenging to stay focused.","A recent social gathering left me feeling drained.  I felt pressure to participate in conversations and activities that didn't really interest me, leaving me exhausted afterward.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I'm comfortable with.","I recently disagreed with a friend about a sensitive topic. I tried to listen to their perspective and explain my own, focusing on finding common ground rather than winning the argument.  My priority was maintaining the friendship despite our differing viewpoints.","I felt overwhelmed and anxious before a big presentation.

The essay itself reveals my struggles with procrastination and time management, like consistently forgetting to use a planner.  While I recognize the value of planning, I haven't developed the necessary strategies to implement it effectively.  I find the lack of self-discipline challenging, but the rewards of connecting with friends and having fun outweigh my anxieties.","Spending time with my new friend energizes me;  the shared laughter and easy conversation are incredibly fulfilling. In contrast, large social gatherings or interactions with strangers often leave me feeling drained. This experience reinforced my preference for close, intimate relationships over broad social circles. The ability to connect deeply with a few people is more rewarding to me than superficial interactions with many.","I prioritize maintaining harmony in my relationships.  Even though I might have differing viewpoints, I strive for mutual understanding and avoid direct conflict.  For example, I tend to laugh along with people instead of expressing my disagreement.

My essay reflects this in my concern over managing my time effectively for studying, remembering homework and exams, and keeping on top of chores like laundry.  However, I also acknowledge a tendency towards procrastination (“I’ll probably get lazy again”).  My strategies involve making lists and setting reminders, but perfection isn't always a priority.  The challenge lies in balancing planning with the spontaneous aspects of my life.","I'm definitely more of an introvert.  The essay demonstrates my preference for spending time alone, pondering various thoughts and concerns.  While I have friends and study partners, my internal world is quite active.  Social interactions can be draining.  The descriptions of my roommate watching TV and me wondering if my music bothers them highlight that I'm not overly eager for constant social engagement.","I generally try to be agreeable. Although I don’t directly express conflict in the essay, my concern for not bothering my roommate with music suggests I'm mindful of other people's feelings.  My tendency towards indecision also hints at an avoidance of confrontation; choosing sushi or pasta indicates a desire to avoid conflict with myself, rather than with another person.","I don't appear to be highly neurotic. While I express some anxiety about exams, homework, and forgetting things, the overall tone of the essay isn't frantic or overly stressed.

I haven't implemented any formal time management system, instead relying on my roommate's help and prioritizing assignments based on deadlines.  Staying committed is hard; I find that immediate gratification often wins out over long-term goals. The reward is definitely the freedom and fun of college life, but the challenge is consistently making sure my schoolwork doesn't suffer.","Going to parties and hanging out with the girls in my dorm has been really energizing.  The positive interactions and shared laughter are incredibly fulfilling.  Conversely, I found that focusing solely on my relationship caused me to withdraw from these social opportunities, and ended up leaving me feeling drained and lonely when that relationship ended. This has reinforced how important social connections are to my well-being.","My disagreement with my boyfriend regarding my social life prompted a difficult conversation. My priority was to understand his perspective while also asserting my need for independence.  I tried to compromise and find common ground, but eventually, the relationship ended up ending because we couldn't reconcile our differing needs and expectations.","The break-up with my boyfriend initially caused significant stress and anxiety.

Moving to Austin for college was a huge step, and I had to learn to manage my own life, something I was never forced to do at home.  I’d say my strategies were more reactive than proactive; I learned as I went and adjusted when needed, like finally ordering my own pizza.

I've always preferred smaller, more intimate settings.  Coming to college and being away from my established friends forced me to break out of my shell, a pretty big deal for me.

I believe finding common ground is more constructive.","I'm prone to anxiety, especially in unfamiliar or challenging situations.  Moving to Austin and being on my own for the first time caused tremendous stress.

For example, I made a point of staying on top of my calculus quizzes; focusing on those ensured I consistently did well.  Balancing my social life with academics was more challenging, but I managed it by prioritizing what felt urgent in the moment—friends, movies, concerts—rather than sticking rigidly to a schedule. This approach often worked, but occasionally led to last-minute scrambles.","Going to a concert with friends would be energizing; I am not someone who enjoys extended solitude. A large party with lots of people would suit me well.  Spending time with close friends, like Ashlee or Cecily, always boosts my mood; there's a natural flow to those interactions that feels incredibly fulfilling.  Conversely, I’ve found that trying to maintain large social networks can quickly leave me drained.  I much prefer deep connections with a smaller circle.","Disagreements aren't something I actively avoid, but I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony. When Nicole got upset with Adam, for example, I offered to talk to her. My main concern wasn't necessarily solving the conflict itself but offering support and reassurance to a friend in need, to help ease the tension.  I’m more concerned about people’s feelings than winning arguments.","Stress and anxiety are certainly familiar feelings. When overwhelmed by my psychology survey, my initial reaction was frustration, bordering on anger; I even considered lashing out at the computer. To manage it, I simply pushed myself to finish it. I prefer to deal with stressful situations by taking action and getting it done instead of dwelling on anxiety. The reward is finishing the task rather than the process of managing the emotions that come with it.",n,y,y,y,n
1567,"I haven't had many opportunities to try completely new things. My life feels pretty confined by my beliefs and worries, and I often stick to what's familiar, even if it doesn't make me happy.  I sometimes think about traveling or exploring different cultures, but my anxieties hold me back. The one exception was when I tried making the New York City background, and that was rewarding because it allowed me to express my feelings about my long distance relationship in a creative way.","I'm a very conscientious person.  I plan my time carefully, always aiming to stay on top of my schoolwork and responsibilities.  For example, I make detailed to-do lists and set reminders. My self-discipline is one of my strengths; and although I struggle with anxiety, my conscientiousness keeps me functioning. I'm more organized than most people I know.","Social interactions generally drain me.  I find large groups overwhelming, and I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  Even then, I often feel awkward and don't feel comfortable engaging much socially.  This essay, though, was different. Pouring out my feelings allowed for catharsis.","I usually try to avoid conflict,  but it is often inevitable. I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony and finding common ground, even if it means compromising my own beliefs, as this is hard for me. Sometimes I feel like I'm letting myself down while trying to be agreeable. My religion dictates my morals, which often conflict with my desires.","I experience anxiety and stress frequently.  My worries about my relationship, my future, and my faith create a lot of internal turmoil. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to turn inwards and overthink, sometimes even feeling paralyzed. Trying to write this essay helped manage these feelings, though, at least a little.",n,y,n,y,y
1568,"I've never been one for meticulously planning things out.  My gay reading list for my Fine Arts class is a perfect example – I have a vague idea of what's expected, but I'm not sure how I'll actually approach the assignment.  The whole thing feels rather open-ended, which I find both appealing and a little unsettling at the same time. This kind of ambiguity doesn't bother me that much, though.  Ultimately, I'm going to do what feels right in the moment.","I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning.  The idea of weight loss, spurred by a girl I like, got me to set a goal, but my approach was loose. I didn't rigidly stick to a schedule or diet, but I did try to improve my habits.  It was more of a general shift in how I approach my overall well-being. I found it challenging to consistently stay motivated, but the desire to feel better about myself kept me going.","I'm not overly extroverted.  Social interaction is okay, but I often find large groups draining. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings with people I feel comfortable around. This is in contrast to noisy, crowded environments.  My ideal social scenario involves a few close friends, engaging conversation, and a relaxed atmosphere.","I avoid direct conflict as much as possible. If I have issues with someone, like my roommate,  I tend to keep my thoughts to myself and maybe subtly distance myself. This is, generally,  the only way I have found to deal with conflict. Open confrontation feels too confrontational and risks damaging the relationship further. My priority is maintaining some level of peace, even if it means avoiding difficult conversations.","I generally don't get overly stressed.   A stressful situation might be my struggle to find someone to go to Texas Ski Ranch with. My initial response is to simply try to find a solution – in this case, putting a call out for other people to go.  I don't get too worked up about things if there's an opportunity for some sort of problem-solving that will alleviate the stress.",y,n,n,n,n
1569,"I'm trying to branch out beyond just hanging out with other music majors.  While I love music and my friends in the music program, I know it's a relatively isolated world.  I'm motivated to meet people from other disciplines because I want a more well-rounded college experience. The experience of getting to know people from other fields has been a mixed bag; some interactions are exciting, but other times I feel a bit out of my element.","Getting from the music building to my astronomy class on time is a major goal. It requires careful time management, as the trek takes longer than I’d like.  While I haven't developed specific strategies yet, my biggest challenge is overcoming my anxiety and slow pace when I am stressed.  The reward will be avoiding one of my biggest pet peeves—being late to class, even if I just sit in the back and listen.","Social experiences are a bit hit or miss for me.  Making new friends in my music classes (Chelsea, Tarra, Janelle, and Aimee) has been energizing, but I feel drained by the sheer effort of navigating college social scenes outside of my major. I think the difference comes down to shared interests and comfort levels; feeling a connection with people boosts my energy, while forcing myself into larger social groups can leave me feeling depleted.","I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  I'll usually just quietly sit and listen rather than interrupt a class I am late to. My priority is not to disrupt anyone or cause a scene, even if it means sacrificing my own comfort or ideal way of participating. While I know its important to communicate, my instinct is to be agreeable to avoid conflict even if it means internalizing feelings.","The thought of getting to Astronomy on time creates significant anxiety.  My initial response is physical – labored breathing due to allergies. To manage this I will probably need to leave earlier than usual, making sure I am as unstressed as possible in preparation for the trek across campus. These panic attacks make me feel more anxious than normal, although I am not afraid of challenges that push me.",y,n,n,y,y
1570,"I don't often seek out new experiences; change unsettles me.  The closest I came was seeing my reflection differently—as a clown, a savior—during a period of intense emotional distress. It wasn’t a conscious choice to explore a new perspective; it just… happened, fueled by my inner turmoil.  The experience was unsettling, reinforcing my preference for the familiar.","Goals?  Sustained effort?  Those concepts feel foreign to me. I tend to act impulsively, reacting to whatever feeling or thought takes hold.  Structure and planning bore me.  The only ""goal"" I recall was ""winning"" some undefined game, but even that was less a conscious pursuit and more a desperate attempt to escape my anxieties.  The only reward is escaping the anxiety, and the challenge is the anxiety itself.","Social interaction drains me.  My interactions with my father, described in the essay, vividly illustrate this.  The conflict and intensity were overwhelming.  I prefer solitude; even the brief moments of connection are too much.  The need for distance from others is a constant, a deep-seated part of who I am.","Disagreements are difficult. I avoid conflict at all costs, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.  I’ll passively accept another’s viewpoint rather than risk confrontation. My priorities are self-preservation and the avoidance of further emotional distress. I don't have the energy to ""resolve"" conflicts; I just want the negativity to stop.","Stress and anxiety are my constant companions.  The essay itself reflects this; the fragmented narrative and bizarre imagery reveal the turmoil within.  My initial response to distress is often impulsive, self-destructive behavior, as in the description of biting my hand. Managing my emotions is an ongoing struggle; I lack the internal resources to cope healthily.",n,n,n,n,y
1571,"I'm not sure I'd call it ""completely new,"" but starting college was definitely a shift.  The sheer number of possibilities was overwhelming at first – unlike high school, where I had a pretty clear path, here I felt lost in the sea of choices. I was motivated by the hope of finding something I'd love, even if that meant stumbling around a bit before I figured it out. It's been a mixed bag so far; exciting but also a little unnerving.","I'm pretty organized, especially when it comes to things I really care about. For example, getting ready for Homecoming. I have a clear timeline in my head: lose weight, shop for an outfit, and then go home to see my family. Time management isn't a huge struggle; I generally get things done when I need to, though sometimes it takes a little longer than I plan.  The challenge is staying motivated – sometimes procrastination hits, especially with pre-calculus homework!  The reward, though, is that feeling of accomplishment when I've ticked everything off my list.","Going to UT has been a huge social experience. I love being around people and meeting new ones, which gives me tons of energy!  Being surrounded by so many different personalities is exciting.  However, the sheer size of the university and sometimes the overwhelming crowds can make me feel drained at times. I find smaller, more intimate gatherings more rewarding – that's why I cherish my long-time friends. It's important for me to have time to recharge after a lot of social interaction.","Disagreements aren't my favorite, and I tend to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground.  My priority is maintaining harmony.  For example, when my roommate plays with her computer, I find it annoying, but I don't say anything directly because it could cause a fight.  Sometimes I wish I were better at expressing my opinions, but avoiding confrontation is more important to me than winning an argument.","I get stressed out easily, particularly when dealing with unexpected problems or when people are angry at me. When that happens, my initial reaction is anxiety which makes me feel the need to immediately fix the problem.  To cope, I tend to focus on things I can control and try to find ways to relax. Things like manicures help me calm down, and I try to use those small acts of self-care to counteract the stress.",n,y,y,n,y
1572,"Trying new things isn't really my style. I tend to stick to what I know and what's expected of me.  This whole essay assignment feels incredibly strange and outside my comfort zone, but I'm trying to approach it with an open mind because I've been told it's important.  It's uncomfortable, but hopefully, it will lead to some kind of understanding.","I've always strived to meet my father's expectations. Becoming a cheerleader at UT, for instance, required immense dedication and hard work. I meticulously followed his guidelines, practiced diligently, and maintained a high GPA. It was demanding, but I stayed focused because pleasing him was paramount.  The challenging part was the constant pressure, but the reward was his approval.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  I find them overwhelming and prefer smaller, more intimate settings. Watching how others interact, especially observing my ex-boyfriend's erratic behavior, is something I've found more fulfilling than being directly involved in large, boisterous groups. It's helped me understand that I need a lot of quiet time to recharge.","I often find myself caught in the middle of other people's conflicts.  Dealing with my ex-boyfriend's angry outbursts and my friend's emotional explosions is difficult.  My priority is to keep the peace, even if it means swallowing my frustration.  I try to listen and understand, hoping to de-escalate the tension, but it's exhausting.","When things get stressful, I tend to internalize it.  My initial response is often quiet withdrawal.  To manage my anxiety, I rely on routines and focusing on tasks that need to be done, like my studies.  Sometimes, though, the stress manifests in indirect ways, like silently observing others and pondering their behavior.",y,y,y,y,y
1573,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay shows I'm stuck in my ways, complaining about reading and school.  Even when my friend Kyle surprised me, my reaction was more anxiety than excitement about a novel experience. I prefer the familiar and predictable.","I struggle with long-term goals and sustained effort. The essay clearly shows my procrastination with schoolwork. I’m behind on reading, frustrated by deadlines, and I prioritize immediate gratification (like avoiding reading) over long-term success (good grades). My time management is poor, and I lack the self-discipline to stay on track, even when I know it’s important.","Social interactions often drain me. The essay reveals my feelings of isolation and loneliness, highlighting my difficulty connecting with others, even old friends. My interaction with Kyle left me feeling unnerved, though there's a hint of enjoyment at his attention.  Large social gatherings, especially with strangers, would probably feel overwhelming. I need a lot of alone time.","Disagreements are difficult for me. The essay doesn't directly show conflict resolution, but my anxiety and frustration imply I'd likely avoid confrontation.  I focus on my own feelings and needs, as my frustration with the rhetoric class clearly demonstrates. I may express my unhappiness rather than actively addressing the conflict.","I'm prone to anxiety and stress. The essay repeatedly mentions stress over school, worry about my mom, and feelings of loneliness and frustration. My immediate response to stress is complaining and dwelling on negative feelings. I acknowledge needing to manage my emotions better, but the essay lacks evidence of constructive coping mechanisms.",n,n,n,n,y

While I played football and track, it wasn't exactly stepping outside my comfort zone—it was more about fitting in and maintaining my existing social circles.","I'm pretty good at sticking to goals, especially if they involve people I care about.  My relationship with my girlfriend is a great example; two years is a long time for me.  I’m not big on detailed planning, but I prioritize what's important to me and stick to it.","Large, loud social gatherings usually drain me. I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I already know well, like my girlfriend and close friends from sports teams.  Big parties feel overwhelming and leave me needing quiet time to recharge.","I generally avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I try to be understanding and find common ground rather than arguing. It's easier to let things go than to create tension, especially if it involves people I value. My relationships are really important to me.","I don't get stressed out easily, but if something does bother me, I usually just try to ignore it or avoid thinking about it.  My relationship with my girlfriend is a safe space, so if I feel down, I spend time with her. I don't dwell on things for too long.",n,y,n,y,n

Moving away to school was a big change, but it wasn't something I actively *chose* for its novelty, more of a necessity for my education.  While I appreciate the independence and new opportunities, I don't actively crave exploring vastly different ways of thinking or activities.  It's been more of an adjustment than a deliberate exploration.","My goal of succeeding in my college courses has required a lot of juggling.  I’m trying to improve my time management, but often get sidetracked. The perfume smell in my dorm is a major distraction, as is Instant Messenger.  Staying committed is tough; procrastination is a constant battle. This upcoming exam period is definitely the biggest challenge I face, as I feel ill-prepared for my chemistry class.","Spending time with my sister and high school friends this weekend is what I'm looking forward to.  Being around people I’m close to is definitely energizing; it’s a nice break from the somewhat stressful dorm life and allows me to recharge. Conversely, the constant interruptions from instant messaging are incredibly draining, and I crave some alone time to focus on my studies.","My roommate and I haven’t had major disagreements, but the constant loud slamming of dorm doors is annoying, even though I know it’s not intentional.  I haven’t directly addressed it. My priority is to get through the semester, and I don’t want to create more conflict. Hopefully, things will improve once the semester settles down.","The overwhelming perfume smell in my room has been a major stressor. The initial response was annoyance and frustration, and it's caused me headaches. To manage it, I’m leaving for the weekend, hoping the smell dissipates. Also, I'm trying not to overthink my upcoming exams, as that causes me more stress and anxiety.",n,n,y,y,n

My goal is to do well in my classes, but I find myself easily distracted by worries and anxieties, leading to procrastination.  I try to manage my time by creating schedules, but sticking to them is a major challenge.  It's rewarding when I do well on an assignment, but the overall experience is more stressful than fulfilling.","The Tuesday night bible study was a positive social experience. Meeting kind people and engaging in shared prayer was uplifting.  However, most of my interactions leave me feeling drained because I'm shy and uncomfortable initiating conversations. I crave closer friendships but lack the confidence to build them.  My social needs clearly aren't being met at this time.","I usually avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize my feelings rather than voicing them.  My priority is to maintain harmony, which sometimes means sacrificing expressing my own opinions. This works at the bible study but is far more challenging in a large, impersonal academic environment.","I frequently experience stress and anxiety, especially about my academics. My initial response is often worry and self-doubt, which increases my anxiety.

My strategies mainly involve setting aside specific times for studying, though sometimes socializing or watching TV takes precedence.  It's challenging to balance everything, but I'm working on it.","Social interactions can be draining, particularly large groups. Spending time with my neighbors is fun sometimes, but being around people for extended periods tires me out. I much prefer smaller, more intimate settings; one-on-one interactions with friends are much more enjoyable.","I'm not one to start arguments, but if I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid confrontation. I might express my opinion politely, but I'm not going to aggressively push for my perspective. I prioritize maintaining a harmonious relationship over necessarily resolving the disagreement.","When stressed or anxious, I tend to initially avoid dealing with the issue.

To stay on track, I've created a detailed schedule, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.  I prioritize the most important aspects first and utilize time management techniques like the Pomodoro method. Although managing time and meeting deadlines can be stressful, the sense of accomplishment upon completion is highly rewarding.","Most social interactions leave me feeling drained rather than energized. This is partly due to my preference for quieter, more introspective activities. Large, noisy gatherings, for instance, tend to overwhelm me.  Understanding this preference allows me to strategically manage my social commitments and prioritize time for solitary pursuits.","I frequently encounter disagreements with my architecture professor, who seems to think he knows everything. I usually try to address these disagreements calmly, stating my opinions without being confrontational.  I prioritize expressing my views clearly and respectfully, even if the professor does not reciprocate.","When faced with stressful deadlines, I initially feel a surge of anxiety.

But I did ultimately manage my time to get it done, and I made sure to buy the Jimmy Eat World tickets beforehand.  My focus is sometimes scattered, but the desire to see the show and do well in my classes helps motivate me to stay on track. Balancing my academic load, social life, and personal interests is sometimes a struggle.","Large, loud social gatherings tend to drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends like Kristina, Jory, and Cherry.

Overall, I'm still figuring out what I actually like and enjoy, so trying new things isn't really my focus right now.","I am fairly conscientious.  I'm managing my karate class alongside my other studies, and while a three-to-five-page paper wasn't what I expected, I'm tackling it. I plan to break it down into manageable chunks to stay on track.  My biggest challenge is avoiding procrastination, especially when other things distract me or I feel discouraged.

When she was gone for four months, I really missed having someone close to me to do things with and share experiences. Seeing her again was energizing and fulfilling; our connection is really important to me. Conversely, interactions with Haley have been draining because I feel she's distancing herself from me and treating me differently now that she has more money. This made me realize how much I value genuine friendships and appreciate friends who don't change based on superficial factors.","My conflict with Haley is a prime example. I tried to understand her absence by reaching out, but her lack of direct communication and her friend's explanations were frustrating.

I haven't pursued a confrontation because I feel hurt and resentful of how she's handled the situation; I'm not sure I can be agreeable given her behavior.","Listening to Alanis Morissette's music about feeling inadequate perfectly captures how I sometimes feel. The feelings of inadequacy, loneliness stemming from the drift in my friendships, and the general uncertainty about the future lead to anxiety.

I value open communication and compromise to reach solutions that work for everyone.","The essay doesn't mention specific stressful events, but based on my overall personality, I'd likely initially feel frustrated and overwhelmed by setbacks like my high school football team's loss.

I have found that smaller, intimate interactions provide a more sustainable level of social energy than large, bustling parties.","I generally strive to be agreeable and understanding, but disagreements do arise. When conflict happens, I prioritize maintaining the relationship.

However, I also feel drained sometimes by the constant activity and the pressure to always be ""on.""  I crave some alone time to recharge and miss my boyfriend and close friends from home terribly.  This experience is making me realize I need a better balance between socializing and solitude.","I generally try to be agreeable, but it’s tough when people aren't understanding of my need for quiet time and focus.  There are definitely disagreements about noise levels in the dorm, but I haven't directly confronted anyone. I prioritize maintaining harmony in my living space, even if it means sacrificing some of my own preferences.","Moving to Austin and starting college have been incredibly stressful.  The noise, the constant social pressure, and my struggles with time management all contribute to my anxiety.  I respond to stress by trying to avoid things or people which aggravate my feelings. I try to calm myself down by listening to music or talking to my family, which helps somewhat, but I am often overwhelmed with stress.",n,n,y,y,y
1586,"I'm naturally curious and open to new experiences, as evidenced by my fascination with the H-bomb poster I acquired.  The motivation stemmed from simply discovering something interesting and aesthetically pleasing;  it added a unique element to my dorm room.  The experience afterward was positive, adding to my sense of contentment and the overall aesthetic of my space.","I'm a conscientious individual, and my ability to start an assignment with a clear timeline, including the math, shows that. I also mentioned setting aside time to read philosophy texts, indicating that I make time for what I find enriching, even if it takes me away from my immediate task. Though I had to work all weekend, I was driven by a combination of my interest in learning and the satisfaction of a break during the week.","I definitely lean towards introversion.  The essay itself is a somewhat solitary activity that I approach thoughtfully, and the fact that I mentioned taking a nap and getting sidetracked highlights my preference for quiet time over social engagement. The feeling of being idle, not having to engage with others, was described as not necessarily bad, but I do mention that I ""have things to do,"" which illustrates my drive and self-direction, more than a reliance on external social cues.","The essay doesn't directly show conflict with others, but it reveals my internal conflict and uncertainty about my pro-choice stance. I openly address the fact that my existing views are challenged by philosophical arguments, and the resulting uncertainty. My priority is intellectual honesty and grappling with complex issues, even if it leads to discomfort or a lack of a strong, decisive position.",My tendency toward neuroticism is clearly visible in the essay. I mentioned my initial reaction to the essay as being worried about finishing in time and expressed a desire for a nap.  The fact that I constantly correct typos and get easily sidetracked highlights anxiety over the quality of work and difficulty with sustained focus.  It is evident that my anxiety is more about internal rather than external conflict.,y,y,n,n,y
1587,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  Sticking to what I know feels safer. The only time I can think of trying something new was when Talia and I were paired as roommates—that was unexpected.  It hasn't been entirely positive, though. I miss my old friends.","I struggle with sticking to goals.  Procrastination is a big problem, especially with homework. I often leave things until the last minute. I wish I had better strategies for managing time and resources because my grades are suffering.  It's frustrating and makes me anxious.","Being around large groups of people or noisy environments tends to drain me. I find myself wanting to retreat to my room after, which is probably why I don’t like being alone but still prefer my own space. I prefer smaller interactions with people I’m comfortable with.  Spending time with Chris and Emy, who are both people I feel very comfortable with, is great, but if there are too many other people involved I get overwhelmed.","Disagreements make me anxious. I try to avoid them, or if I have to deal with them, I tend to just agree to keep the peace, even if I don't actually agree.  I dislike conflict and prioritize avoiding it, which isn't always the best approach. The people on my floor are always yelling, and that just annoys me so much.","I worry a lot.  Even small things—like a strange computer noise or the rain—can trigger anxiety. I'm stressed about my scholarship money, my grades, and my weight. My initial response to stress is often worry, and it takes effort to find ways to calm down. I find myself spending too much time feeling jealous and anxious about other people which makes me feel even worse.",n,n,n,n,y
1588,"Trying something new is a constant for me.  Moving away to UT for college was a huge leap, completely different from my life back home.  It was motivated by a desire for independence and self-discovery, away from my overbearing mother's influence.  The experience has been overwhelmingly positive; I feel happier and more authentically myself than ever before.","Becoming a writer is a long-term goal requiring significant self-discipline.  I struggle with procrastination, which is frustrating.  I haven't found effective time management strategies yet,  but the desire to write is strong enough that I keep coming back to it, even if I don't always finish what I start.  The rewarding aspect is the feeling of creative expression; the challenge is overcoming my own self-doubt and laziness.","Unannounced visits from high school friends energized me immensely.  Their genuine care and spontaneous gesture made me feel loved and appreciated, proving that meaningful social connections can be incredibly uplifting.  Conversely, I find large, noisy gatherings draining. This experience solidified my preference for close, intimate relationships over superficial social interactions.","My mother and I have vastly differing viewpoints on many things. Handling these disagreements is difficult; I prioritize open communication but often find that my attempts at explaining myself are dismissed.   It’s frustrating because I want her to understand my perspective, but it's clear that our fundamental differences may always create conflict.","My mother's controlling behavior is a constant source of stress and anxiety.  My initial reaction is often anger and resentment, followed by a desire to escape her influence.  To manage these feelings, I focus on my independent life at UT, and the support of my friends helps.  Maintaining distance is key to managing my emotional response to her actions.",y,y,n,n,y
1589,"I've always been a creature of habit, but recently, I was spurred to try something new: I went to a poetry slam. I'd never considered myself a poetry person, much less someone who'd enjoy listening to others' original works, but my girlfriend suggested it and her enthusiasm was contagious.  I was surprisingly moved by some of the poems; the honesty and vulnerability of the performers really resonated.  It definitely broadened my appreciation for different forms of creative expression.","I'm not someone who's known for my organizational skills.  If a goal requires sustained effort, I tend to approach it in fits and starts.  So, for example, when I decided to learn a new language (Spanish), I had to use a calendar and reminder apps relentlessly to keep myself on track.  Even then, there were many days I simply skipped my lessons!  What I found most challenging was sticking to a routine, but most rewarding was seeing even the slightest progress made.","A memorable social experience that left me drained was a large party.  I can be social, but large gatherings of people tend to overwhelm me. The sheer amount of noise and the constant pressure to make conversation exhausted me, and I felt a strong need to retreat.  I learned that I need to carefully choose my social settings, prioritizing small, intimate gatherings over large crowds.","In disagreements, I have a tendency to withdraw emotionally, rather than confront the person directly.  This stems from a desire to avoid conflict, even if that means I'm not truly expressing my point of view.  For example, when my friend and I had a serious disagreement about a shared project, instead of directly voicing my concerns, I quietly backed down to avoid escalating the situation. Although this approach might temporarily quell the conflict, I know it’s not the most constructive solution long-term.","Recently, I felt particularly anxious when the library enforced their strict quiet policy which cut my enjoyment of a digital greeting card short. The immediate response was irritation and frustration with the imposition on my audio experience.  To manage this, I simply left the library and sought a more accommodating setting to experience the card in full. The experience reinforced my preference for peace and quiet while simultaneously teaching me to adjust my expectations when in public spaces.",y,n,y,n,n
1590,"I'm not one for radically new experiences; I tend to stick to what I know.  My roommate sleeps all the time, and that's just how things are, right? Though I did consider getting a coffee maker, which would be *somewhat* new.  Ultimately, the thought of potential fire code violations stopped me. It's not really worth the risk or hassle.","I'm pretty goal-oriented.  I've got this big goal to graduate, and that requires getting good grades in my 8 o'clock class. While I have a messy room, and loads of laundry and dishes piled up, this is only slightly concerning.   To stay on track, I just need to find a balance of study, and social interaction with Craig and Brittany. The challenge is prioritizing everything; the reward is graduation and making my parents proud.","Going to Fort Worth with my friends this weekend will definitely energize me. I find that being around friends, like Craig and Jorge, recharges me and allows me to be more social. On the other hand, spending time with people I don't click with – such as someone who seems snobby, drains my energy.  I value quality time with good friends over large, boisterous gatherings.","Disagreements? Yeah, Candice accusing me of breaking Andrew's windshield was a prime example. I didn't do it, but she clearly doesn't want to listen to reason, so I just let it go. It wasn't worth my effort, and frankly, Andrew wasn't very nice to Brittany, so I don't feel too bad about his fate.  My priority is to avoid pointless arguments.","Stress?  Yeah, sometimes this constant feeling of being behind on everything gets to me.  When things get overwhelming, I tend to procrastinate. But then I remind myself that I'm not the only one who feels this way, or I try to focus on the one thing I do have some control over -- my upcoming trip to Fort Worth. I try to take things one step at a time and keep things in perspective.",n,y,y,n,n
1591,"I recently decided to take a classical civilization class, something I initially wasn't sure about.  My motivation was curiosity about a subject I knew little about, and I've found myself genuinely enjoying it, particularly the  exploration of ancient Greek literature and history,  much more than I initially expected.","I set a goal to finish reading *The Iliad* and *The Republic*,  though I haven't quite reached the latter yet. I manage my time poorly, often prioritizing immediate interests over long-term goals. While I started reading  *The Iliad* out of obligation, I have found it increasingly engaging, even when other things compete for my attention, this is  motivated by my genuine interest in the subject material.","A recent social experience that left me feeling drained was a quick phone call with my mom while I was at Starbucks. While I appreciate the call, I tend to prefer less interaction, even with family. I find lengthy conversations exhausting and often prefer spending time alone or doing solitary things, and prefer the peace of my own company.","I don't often find myself in major disagreements, but I tend to avoid direct confrontation. If a disagreement arises, I might choose to avoid the issue or subtly steer the conversation toward a mutual understanding rather than directly challenging the other person’s viewpoint. I am more likely to disengage rather than create a conflict.","I sometimes feel stressed about upcoming deadlines or lectures, but I rarely dwell on it. I might procrastinate, but I typically manage to complete my tasks eventually.  Over sleeping has led to me being late to class but it has not really affected my academic performance because it's easier than the high school curriculum.  I handle stress by keeping busy, and often find that once I'm immersed in a task or activity, the anxiety fades.",y,y,n,n,n
1592,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things, honestly.  I'm pretty happy sticking to what I know.  The only thing new that really comes to mind was going to college in a new city and meeting all these diverse people at UT. It was nerve-wracking at first but also exciting to be outside of my small town.  I mostly did it because of the opportunities that came with a big state school like UT. Overall, despite the stress, I'm glad I did it; it's been a great experience meeting so many different kinds of people.","I'm definitely not the most organized person.  Juggling school, a sorority, and a social life is proving to be a huge challenge. I’m constantly feeling overwhelmed, and I haven’t quite figured out how to manage my time and resources effectively. My biggest challenge is balancing my desire to do everything well (sorority activities, volunteering, maintaining a high GPA) with the reality that there are only so many hours in a day. The rewarding part is how much fun I'm having with my new friends.","I love being around people.  Rush week was incredibly emotionally draining, and although there were many heartbroken girls, I have met tons of really amazing girls through my sorority.  Going to those mixers and meeting up with people helps me to recharge. I value my relationships and friendships a lot and making new friends is one of the most rewarding things for me. Being around positive, kind people is really important for my well-being.","I generally try to get along with everyone, but it hasn't always been easy. I'm having some issues with my ex-boyfriend—he's making things very difficult and not communicating honestly. While I do wish he'd be more open and honest, I try to keep things civil as much as possible.  It's more important to me to stay calm than to start a big fight, especially now that we are both in the same city.","I'm stressed out, almost constantly! Starting college, adjusting to a new city, joining a sorority, and dealing with my ex are all putting a lot on my plate. It causes sleepless nights and feelings of being overwhelmed. To cope, I try to keep myself busy with fun activities like spending time with my sorority sisters, and going to the children’s hospital. I'm really focusing on finding a place to live next year and I hope that will give me some stability in the chaos.",n,n,y,y,n
1593,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person when it comes to radically new experiences.  My essay shows a focus on my studies and family, rather than exploring unfamiliar activities. While I appreciate learning new things like philosophy,  my exploration is primarily driven by academic goals, not a desire for novelty for its own sake.","My dedication to my studies and future career as an attorney reflects a strong sense of conscientiousness. I meticulously plan my time, balancing studying for exams like the upcoming astronomy test with other activities.  Prioritizing my academic goals,  I'm proactive about ensuring I'm well-prepared, and I work to stay organized and focused on my long-term objective of becoming a successful attorney.  The challenge lies in balancing academic rigor with social and family obligations; the reward is the satisfaction of knowing I'm working toward achieving a meaningful goal.","The essay highlights my enjoyment of social interaction, especially with family and close friends (like the gaming sessions and upcoming trip with my grandmother).  While I enjoy being around people I’m close to, large social gatherings at UT are mentioned as a difference between semesters.  Meaningful interactions with loved ones energize me, and those moments are often where I feel the most content. My social preferences lean toward close, intimate connections over large, more superficial gatherings.","I value my relationships with family and friends immensely, as demonstrated by my close bonds with my parents and grandmother.  While the essay doesn't specifically detail conflict resolution, my appreciation for my family suggests that I'd prioritize maintaining harmonious relationships. If disagreements arise, I'd aim for understanding and compromise, valuing others' perspectives and seeking mutually beneficial solutions.","The upcoming astronomy exam makes me nervous, which is shown in my essay.  While I recognize the stress and anxiety of the exam, I also demonstrate a proactive approach to managing this through focused studying and planning.  My response isn't to avoid the stressor, but to confront it with strategies that mitigate the anxiety through preparation. I handle stress by focusing on my academic goals and the support I have from my family.",n,y,y,y,n
1594,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  My friend suggested writing in a bad mood for more material, and while that seems interesting, I'm not sure I'd be comfortable intentionally putting myself in that state. My writing process tends to be more about clearing my head than exploring something novel.  The most ""new"" thing I did recently was go to camp as staff, and even that was familiar territory.","I don't really have a process for achieving long-term goals. My essay shows my writing process, which is more reactive and less planned.  I started this essay without a real plan, and while I am trying to meet the word count,  I don't have a structured approach for managing my time or resources. I'm more focused on the immediate task of getting words down than on a broader strategy.","Social interactions tend to drain me.  Talking to my friend about the essay made me nervous, and I prefer smaller, less demanding social circles. I am not someone who's energized by large social gatherings or extended conversations. My preference is for quiet time alone or with a small group of close friends.","Disagreements are something I usually avoid if possible.  The essay reflects my lack of assertive disagreement, as I am not confident in expressing opposing opinions.  Rather than confrontation, I would rather find common ground and avoid conflict altogether. I would likely try to accommodate the other person's views to maintain a peaceful relationship.","I get nervous easily. Writing this assignment made me anxious, and I mentioned my apprehension about misspelling words and not knowing what to write.  My coping mechanisms involve talking to friends (for reassurance) and then writing down my thoughts, almost as a way to externalize and release my anxieties. The act of writing itself serves as a method of calming my nerves.",y,n,n,n,n
1595,"While I'm not naturally drawn to radically new experiences, starting college forced me to try many things for the first time – doing laundry, being entirely responsible for my meals, navigating a large and unfamiliar social environment.  Initially, I felt a need to prove I wasn't overwhelmed, but the unexpected enjoyment I found in simple tasks like laundry surprised me. This experience broadened my comfort zone, revealing unexpected capacities for self-reliance and adaptation.","Balancing academics and the social pressures of college life required a lot of discipline. I developed a simple schedule to manage my time for studying and my personal life. Staying committed was challenging, especially in the beginning when so much was new and I missed home. However, the reward of managing everything independently has been satisfying and has instilled in me a sense of self-confidence.","Most social situations drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings to the large, bustling crowds of college life.  The sheer scale of interactions in college was overwhelming at first.  This experience reinforced my preference for quieter, more meaningful interactions, highlighting my introverted nature.  I need quiet time to recharge after social engagement.","Disagreements are difficult for me, especially in large settings. I find it challenging to assert myself in situations where many people hold differing opinions.  I tend to compromise to minimize conflict. My priority is to avoid confrontation and maintain harmony, even if it means that my own opinions aren't fully heard.","The death of my parents greatly impacted my life and caused significant stress and anxiety. Initially, I withdrew and felt hopeless.  However, focusing on practical tasks like my studies helped me manage those emotions.

That might be something I consider in the future, but for now, my focus is on adjusting to college life in Austin.","My main goal right now is successfully completing my first semester of college.  To stay on track, I’m prioritizing my classes and making sure to keep up with assignments.  I’ve found that being organized, especially with my time, is crucial.  While there have been times I’ve struggled to keep everything balanced, knowing that I want to make my family proud and secure a good future motivates me. The biggest challenge has been adjusting to being away from home.","Large social gatherings tend to drain my energy. I much prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with people I’m close to, like my family and girlfriend. The most fulfilling social experiences are when I’m spending quality time with my loved ones—it really recharges me.  Being away at college has made me realize how important close relationships are to me.","I try to approach disagreements with empathy and understanding.  It’s important to listen to the other person's perspective before jumping to conclusions.  I value my relationships, so finding a solution that respects everyone's feelings is my priority. I believe finding common ground is always possible, and I prefer open communication to avoid conflict escalation.","When I'm stressed, I usually try to take a break and relax, maybe listening to music or focusing on a small task.

The feeling of releasing my thoughts onto paper in a less structured way was enjoyable.","I'm generally quite driven to complete my tasks, even when tired.  This assignment, alongside my other responsibilities, required efficient time management and prioritizing to ensure completion. While exhaustion was a challenge, the satisfaction of finishing everything contributed to my overall sense of accomplishment.","My recent conversation with my lonely best friend left me feeling drained, despite my desire to help. The inability to be physically present with her limited my ability to truly support her.  It reinforced my need for in-person interaction for deep connection, highlighting the limitations of digital communication.","I tend to avoid direct conflict, opting instead to approach disagreements with understanding and empathy. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, so I prefer finding common ground rather than engaging in heated arguments.","Feeling overwhelmed and exhausted is a common experience for me.

I diligently tracked my order, and managed to make the time to go to the post office to get them. It felt rewarding to finally have corrected vision, and even though it took several weeks, it made me feel more put together and capable.","A memorable social experience was moving in with my new roommate.  It was energizing because I enjoyed getting to know someone new and having someone to talk to while writing this.  The initial interaction felt positive, though future interactions depend on her reciprocity.","My disagreement with my old roommates stemmed from their lack of reciprocity after we were kind to them. I tried to communicate my feelings, but my priorities were protecting myself and building a relationship with a more compatible roommate.","Feeling stressed about money and tuition really got to me.

The assignment was a struggle, and my stream-of-consciousness writing reflects my difficulty in sticking to a plan.  While I value my friendships, my priorities often get sidetracked. Completing this assignment, for instance, has proven more challenging than I initially anticipated.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  The essay details my frustration with my friends' chatter and the interruption to my focus.  While I enjoy my friends' company, large groups or prolonged interactions often leave me feeling depleted, as reflected in my discomfort with their constant presence and my desire for solitude to complete this assignment.","I tend to avoid conflict. The essay doesn't show any major arguments, but it reveals my low tolerance for interruptions and my passive-aggressive responses to my friends' actions. I prioritize maintaining the surface harmony of the friendship over addressing issues directly.","I experience anxiety and stress easily.
