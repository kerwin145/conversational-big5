1601,"I recently started learning about psychology, which was initially just a required course.  However, reading the textbook piqued my interest in the vastness of the field and the potential for understanding human behavior.  I was initially apprehensive about the course but am now finding it surprisingly engaging and thought-provoking.","Managing my time as a TA with two different classes and my own studies requires careful planning.  I prioritize my tasks, create a schedule, and use a planner to keep track of deadlines. Although I sometimes struggle with maintaining motivation, the satisfaction of completing assignments and successfully helping my students keeps me going.  The challenge lies in balancing academic commitments with other aspects of life.","I find large, loud social gatherings, like parties, draining. The prospect of attending such events, especially with concerns about safety, causes me significant anxiety. Quiet, smaller interactions with close friends are more fulfilling and energizing for me. My preference is clearly for more intimate, less overwhelming social situations.","When I disagree with someone, I try to understand their perspective before expressing my own opinion. I prioritize maintaining respectful communication, even if we don't come to a complete agreement. My aim is to find common ground and foster a positive relationship, even in the face of disagreement.","The constant clicking of my dorm room clock combined with my tendency to overthink causes me significant sleep problems. I frequently wake up feeling exhausted.  My initial response is often anxiety, but I've begun to implement strategies like relaxation techniques and mindfulness to manage my stress and anxiety more effectively.",y,y,n,y,n
1602,"I'm always looking for new experiences.  Taking scuba diving lessons was completely outside my comfort zone, motivated by a desire for something adventurous and different. While initially apprehensive, I found the experience exhilarating and am already planning my next dive.","I'm not the most organized person.  Planning a camping trip and fitting in my Frank Erwin Center training required juggling multiple things and a lot of last minute scrambling. I often procrastinate and struggle to commit to long-term plans, making sure I have enough time to prepare for activities is a major challenge for me.","I love being around people, so online chatting with friends from back home is essential to keep my social tank full. But, sometimes interacting with a large group, like the whole Ultimate Frisbee team initially, can be draining.  I find smaller groups of friends more fulfilling because I get more individual attention and connection.","I'm not always the easiest person to get along with.  When I disagree with someone, I usually try to find a compromise that works for everyone. But my priorities are often to ensure that my needs are met, sometimes at the cost of others' feelings. For example, even if everyone else wants to go out on Saturday, I prioritize getting a job so that I'm free to go out then.","I tend to be a bit anxious and overthink things.  Not being able to sleep last night because of a loose piece of paper illustrates this.  I often let my worries spiral; however, I try to employ simple coping mechanisms, like listening to music or chatting with friends online, to calm myself down.",y,n,y,n,y
1603,"I'm always looking for new ways to make money, and that often involves trying new things.  For example, I recently helped a friend troubleshoot a faulty cable modem, which involved learning about internet diagnostics I hadn't dealt with before.  While frustrating at times, it was a novel challenge, and I felt a sense of accomplishment once the problem was (temporarily) solved.","I'm pretty productive when it comes to the things I care about.  For instance, I made sure to do my laundry first thing this morning, even before eating, showing my ability to manage my time somewhat effectively (though I acknowledge my procrastination on academic work). While I sometimes prioritize activities like football over studying, I have consistently maintained a 3.2 GPA despite failing a few classes, which shows a degree of determination and adaptability in my academics.","Playing football with my coworkers is a truly energizing experience.  The camaraderie and friendly competition are highly fulfilling.  I thrive in these social interactions, finding them invigorating and enjoyable. This experience reinforces my preference for close, social bonds and friendships built on shared activities.","When my friend needed money and help getting his towed truck, I readily helped him out. While there were potential risks involved in signing for the truck, my concern for my friend outweighed these concerns. Helping my friends is usually my priority, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone.","I get easily frustrated with technology malfunctions, as seen in my rant about the internet. My initial response is often anger and frustration, but I usually take steps to resolve the problem, such as calling Road Runner and following their instructions. I have learned to manage my stress through problem-solving and I move on once the problem is resolved.",y,y,y,y,n
1604,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a bit daunting.  The prospect of joining the crew team, despite my initial apprehension about the physical demands, appeals to me because it represents a significant challenge and a chance to step outside my comfort zone.  I'm hoping this will lead to personal growth and help me discover hidden strengths I didn't know I possessed. The possibility of learning a new skill and pushing my physical limits excites me more than the fear holds me back.","Balancing academics and extracurricular activities is something I'm acutely aware of, especially as a Pre-Pharmacy student. My goal is to maintain a high GPA while still pursuing other interests.  To do this, I meticulously plan my schedule, utilizing calendars and to-do lists to track assignments and commitments.  I'm prioritizing my tasks in order to ensure that my studies are not neglected. Although the prospect of 5 AM practices is daunting, my commitment to my goals and to efficient time management will help me overcome the challenge.","The Texas Crew meeting was a mixed bag, socially.  While the prospect of making new friends is appealing,  my current experiences on my dorm floor have been somewhat isolating.  Everyone seems friendly enough, but the fast-paced environment and everyone's busy schedules make it hard to connect deeply. I'm an introvert at heart and prefer meaningful relationships over superficial interactions, which explains my reservations about forging new friendships. The ""fakeness"" I felt in my previous social circle underscores my desire for genuine connections.","I tend to avoid conflict, preferring harmony and understanding.  While I haven't described any explicit disagreements in my essay, my desire for genuine friendships hints at my approach to interpersonal conflicts; I value honesty and openness in my relationships and would prioritize communicating my needs and feelings clearly and respectfully, focusing on mutual understanding rather than winning an argument. I'd aim to find a compromise that works for everyone involved.","The thought of joining crew, combined with the pressure of academics, definitely causes stress and anxiety. My initial reaction is a mixture of excitement and fear.  To cope, I try to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, and focus on controlling what I can while accepting what I can't.  This structured approach helps me manage stress, and my desire to write this essay already showcases how I process my anxieties.",y,y,n,y,n
1605,"I don't often seek out new experiences; in fact, the idea of trying something completely new fills me with a sense of unease and apprehension.  My comfort lies in the familiar, and stepping outside of that feels overwhelming and potentially chaotic.  Novelty isn't something I actively pursue.","Setting and achieving long-term goals has never been my strong suit.  I struggle with organization and time management, often finding myself overwhelmed and easily sidetracked.  Procrastination is a common issue, and maintaining consistent effort requires a level of discipline I don't naturally possess.  The thought of sustained effort itself is draining.","Social interactions, particularly large ones, tend to leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed.  I prefer smaller, more intimate gatherings or even solitude.  Extended periods of socializing feel invasive and exhausting, leading to a need for quiet time to recharge and recover.  I value close relationships but find large social settings demanding.","Disagreements are often difficult for me to navigate.  I tend to avoid conflict and may even internalize disagreements to prevent confrontation.  My priority is to minimize tension and maintain a superficial sense of harmony, even if it means sacrificing my own needs or viewpoints.  Direct confrontation is something I usually try to avoid at all costs.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions. My initial response is often avoidance or retreat. I tend to overthink and ruminate on issues, which amplifies my feelings of stress.  Managing these emotions requires conscious effort and often involves distracting myself or seeking solitude to calm down. Constructive approaches to managing my stress require a high level of conscious effort that I don't always have the energy to initiate.",n,n,n,n,n
1606,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly an adventurous person, but I did try yoga with my roommate. I wasn't exactly motivated by anything deep; it was more of a ""let's try something new"" kind of thing. It wasn't my cup of tea, though.  The stretching was okay, but I prefer more intense, upbeat workouts.  It made me realize I need activities that are more energetic and less focused on quiet, slow movements.","I’m not really one for setting long-term goals and meticulously sticking to them.  If there's something I need to accomplish, like getting more cell phone minutes, I'll work at it, but it’s usually not through careful planning.  I'm more of a ""wing it"" type, and I honestly find a lack of structure more freeing.  I'm not exactly happy about my mom's strict budget for my cell phone and food, but whatever.  College life is more important.","Going to yoga with my roommate was a mixed bag socially. The class itself wasn’t exactly social, but spending time with her afterward was fun.  Quiet time is fine, but I enjoy being around people and chatting, especially with those close to me.  It reinforced that I thrive in situations with active communication, rather than serene or quiet ones. I find energy in chatting online with friends and joking around.","I generally get along with people.  My roommate and I went through a minor disagreement because I didn't like her praying when I wanted to listen to music.  We compromised. This works because we both value our friendship. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, even if it means adjusting my preferences. I'm not the kind of person to stir up big arguments.","My mom calling to lecture me about my cell phone and credit card was pretty stressful. My initial reaction was to cry, which totally surprised my roommate.  Dealing with my mom's lectures is kind of my usual stressor. I manage it by venting to my roommate and just waiting for it to be over. I generally try not to dwell on things that stress me out, which has its pros and cons.",n,n,y,y,n
1607,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and recently I decided to try crew. I’ve always been more of a bookworm, so joining a sports team felt completely outside my comfort zone, but I figured trying new things is important.  The motivation was partly social—I wanted to meet athletic people and get more physically active—and partly a desire to challenge myself. Although I'm not a naturally sporty person, I actually really enjoyed being part of the team and the physical challenge.","My goal is to succeed in my challenging AP classes, which requires balancing studying with my social life. Time management is definitely a struggle. I usually procrastinate until the last minute, and my methods aren't exactly efficient; but I'm trying to improve! It’s a struggle. It's rewarding to do well, but it can feel overwhelming and stressful when it impacts my social life.","Watching the football game with Taylor and friends is my favorite kind of social experience. The energy is infectious, and being with people who enjoy the same things I do makes me feel happy and fulfilled.  Quiet moments where I can recharge are also important, but generally being around positive and supportive people energizes me.","I value understanding and acceptance above all else. I think a lot of conflict stems from misunderstanding, so even when I disagree with someone, I prioritize open communication and finding common ground.  I try my best to actively listen, empathize, and resolve conflicts peacefully.","I've struggled with some anxiety about the pressure of school and expectations for my future, but I've come to accept that this is simply a process and all part of living. I also find that having time to myself and focusing on things that make me happy (like reading or being with friends) helps me manage it constructively. I remind myself that everyone feels stressed at times, so I try to let it roll off my back.",y,n,y,y,n
1608,"While I haven't done anything drastically different, starting college is a big change for me.  It's motivated by a desire to experience something new and figure out who I want to be.  So far, it feels exciting, though a little overwhelming.","My goal is to do well in college.  I'm trying to manage my time by balancing socializing with studying, though I haven't fully established a strict schedule yet.  Staying committed is challenging, especially with the distractions of college life, but I believe hard work now will pay off later.","Meeting new people in college has been energizing, mostly because I'm actively seeking out social interactions.  It's fulfilling to connect with others, even briefly. However, some interactions can be draining if I worry too much about what others think.","I haven't had any major disagreements yet, but I tend to be willing to see other points of view, even if I don't agree. My priority is understanding the other person's perspective, rather than necessarily winning an argument. I tend to overthink things and this sometimes affects my interactions with others.","I get stressed about academics, especially calculus, and sometimes about social situations. I usually try to manage it by writing in my journal, which helps me process my emotions.  I also try to stay relaxed when possible, and go out and meet new people.",n,y,y,n,n
1609,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  The essay reflects that - I was in a new environment (the library), but it didn't feel like an exciting adventure, more like a disorienting experience. I tend to stick to what's familiar and comfortable.  Novelty stresses me out more than it excites me.","Honestly, I struggle with setting and maintaining goals.  The essay shows a lack of focus and purpose; I was just sitting there, observing.  I don’t have a lot of self-discipline or organizational skills; completing tasks is challenging. This all contributes to my general state of feeling overwhelmed and lost.","Being in that crowded, quiet library was utterly draining. I prefer solitude, and the constant awareness of others around me only amplified my anxiety and discomfort. Large social gatherings fill me with dread. I recharge best in quiet, solitary spaces.","I tend to avoid conflict.  The essay shows a passive observation of the environment; I didn’t engage with anyone. If I disagree with someone, I’ll usually just keep quiet and avoid confrontation; it's easier that way. Direct disagreement is just not my style.","The entire library experience was incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. The feelings of being watched, the overwhelming sensory input, the physical discomfort—it all contributed to a state of high anxiety. I responded by withdrawing and observing, a kind of freezing response.  My anxiety made the experience feel completely disorienting and unpleasant.",y,n,y,n,y
1610,"I don't actively seek out new experiences; I'm perfectly content with my routine.  The thought of trying something completely different fills me with a sense of unease.  My motivation for trying anything new is typically driven by necessity rather than a desire for novelty.  Afterward, I'm usually just relieved it's over.","I struggle with long-term goals.  Time management isn't my strong suit, and I often find myself overwhelmed by the demands of multiple commitments.  Procrastination is a common issue for me, and maintaining motivation is a constant battle.  Challenges often lead to frustration and feelings of being overwhelmed; rewards are few and far between.","Large social gatherings leave me feeling drained and overwhelmed.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well.  Meaningful conversations and genuine connections are important to me, but prolonged exposure to noisy, energetic environments exhausts me. My social needs center around a small circle of trusted individuals.","Disagreements are uncomfortable; I tend to avoid direct conflict whenever possible.  My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own opinions. I'll attempt to find common ground, often prioritizing the other person's feelings over expressing my own dissenting views.","Stress and anxiety trigger feelings of overwhelm.  I might initially withdraw or become irritable. My coping mechanisms are often unhealthy, like ruminating or escaping through distractions. I don't actively manage my emotional responses; I prefer to let them pass without direct intervention.",n,n,n,y,n
1611,"I've always been drawn to unconventional experiences.  For instance, I once decided to try stand-up comedy, something completely outside my comfort zone. While terrifying initially, the thrill of crafting jokes and performing them in front of strangers was exhilarating. Afterward, even though I bombed, the whole experience felt liberating and oddly empowering.","I'm not naturally organized.  I often find myself starting many projects but not finishing them.  I rarely create strict schedules or detailed plans. When I do have a goal, it’s more about managing my impulses and trying to be present in the moment. I'm more about feeling my way through things than meticulously planning.","A memorable social experience was attending a crowded concert. The energy of the crowd was infectious and made me feel alive and connected. The shared experience of listening to music, singing along, and dancing created this awesome sense of community. I thrive in those kind of high energy environments.","I usually try to find common ground, even in disagreements. I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective; hearing them out, even when I strongly disagree, to find a compromise that works for both of us. Confrontation isn't my style; I'd rather find a way to peacefully resolve the conflict.","I experience stress and anxiety often.  My initial reaction is usually emotional— sometimes overwhelming sadness or anger—but I try to manage these feelings by talking to a friend, journaling or listening to music. This helps me process my emotions before addressing the problem more constructively.",y,n,y,y,y
1612,"I've always been drawn to unique and vibrant things. Decorating my room with butterflies is just one example of this.  The thought of Texas Crew initially excited me, the rush of exercise appealing to a desire for new experiences.  However, the logistics – the transportation and the time commitment – made me hesitant. Ultimately, the novelty and potential excitement weren't enough to outweigh the practical challenges.","I struggle with procrastination; this essay is a prime example.  I intended to write this sooner, but the desire for ice cream and other distractions took precedence.  My time management skills are definitely an area I need to improve.  While I recognize this lack of conscientiousness is a problem, I haven't yet developed effective strategies to overcome it.","The essay illustrates my introversion.  The loud people yelling annoyed me, and the thought of the busy library frightened me. Social interactions, particularly small talk, drain my energy.  Large group settings, or even small groups where I am expected to engage in extended conversation, leave me feeling overwhelmed.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social interactions, or time alone.","My disagreement with the ""quote of the day"" demonstrates a lack of agreeableness.  While I felt it was inappropriate and didn't represent my views, I chose not to directly challenge it, partly due to the presence of the person responsible.  My reaction to my neighbor shows a similar pattern: annoyance but a lack of direct confrontation. I value my own comfort and preferences over directly addressing the conflict.","Running alone at 4:30 a.m. resulted in a frightening experience, illustrating my anxiety. My immediate response was fear.  I managed my emotions by avoiding similar situations and am likely to be cautious in the future.  While I don't always actively manage stress, I tend to avoid the stressors themselves, creating a pattern of avoiding stressful environments and situations.",y,n,n,n,y
1613,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly open to new experiences.  My passions are fairly well-defined, and I tend to stick with what I know and enjoy.  The cancellation of Farscape really shook me up; I wasn't looking for a new show, and the idea that something I enjoyed could simply vanish was upsetting and frankly terrifying. It’s not like I’m actively seeking out something radically different, I just wish things would stay the same.","I'm incredibly focused when something matters to me.  When I set a goal, like ensuring I complete a writing assignment,  I will stay on task; however, the time counter malfunctioned. I found that frustrating and it made me work longer to compensate. The intense emotional state I was in took my attention away and made things more challenging. If only they hadn't cancelled Farscape.","Social interactions often drain me.  I prefer the company of my thoughts and I found the whole Farscape cancellation situation to be incredibly draining.  The lack of control over the situation and how much it has affected me emotionally only makes matters worse. I am already annoyed because this response needs to be longer and this is really difficult for me, it’s hard to focus.","I'm not known for my agreeableness. The disagreement I have is with the Scifi Channel and USA Network executives; their decision was incredibly illogical. I'm not planning on resolving that conflict with politeness or compromise, my feelings about this matter are intense. I'm not easily swayed or willing to negotiate on matters this important.","The cancellation of Farscape caused significant stress and anxiety. My initial reaction was intense anger and frustration. I channeled those emotions into writing this intense, emotionally charged response. The situation is frustrating and out of my control, and I feel like those feelings are all consuming, and the only way to deal with it is to write about it.",n,y,n,n,y
1614,"I've always been drawn to experiences that challenge my comfort zone, and recently, that involved attending a meditation class.  My motivation stemmed from a desire for self-discovery and a feeling of being lost. Afterward, I felt a sense of peace and clarity I hadn't experienced before, even though it was initially unsettling to explore such a different way of thinking.","I’m not someone who thrives on rigid schedules and long-term planning; my lack of structure and goals is a source of frustration. Setting and achieving goals aren't natural to me, making the experience challenging. I struggle to manage my time effectively and stay motivated when things get tough.  I would rather explore impulsively than to stick to any sort of plan.","A recent dinner with some new guys from my hall was quite energizing.  The interaction was fun and engaging, despite some uncertainties about their intentions. I enjoy being around people, but I'm also sensitive to superficial interactions, which can be draining if it feels insincere or manipulative. This experience helped me realize the importance of choosing social settings and interactions carefully.","Disagreements are never fun.  I’m not someone who avoids conflict, but I find it challenging.  My priority is usually to avoid major conflict, even if it means compromising my own views.  I tend to place a higher value on maintaining relationships than on winning an argument, even if that means swallowing my pride and letting some things go.","The overwhelming stress of trying to figure out my future has been immensely difficult. My initial response is often to retreat and overthink everything, leaving me feeling anxious and overwhelmed. To cope, I've found that meditation and self-reflection, along with expressing my feelings through writing, helps me gain some perspective and manage the emotional turmoil.",y,n,y,n,y
1615,"I'm not exactly sure what counts as ""trying something completely new,"" but I guess building my own computer was pretty different.  I don't really plan things out much; I just sort of do things. It was more of a need than a desire, but I did enjoy the process—mostly the sense of accomplishment and control. Afterwards, it felt good to have something that worked that I had made myself.","I set a goal of getting a 3.7 GPA to get into business school.  I don’t really *manage* my time—more like I react to deadlines, and that’s not exactly effective, considering I haven't even had a job before. I get good grades in economics, so that helps.  The challenge is mostly the competition. It's a lot of pressure, and I’m not even sure I really want this, but I guess I should keep trying.","Social experiences mostly drain me.  My friends' band wants me to sing, but honestly, the thought makes me anxious. I'm just not a social person; I prefer to watch TV or play video games. It’s more relaxing, less stressful than people. I really like being alone.","I avoid conflict. I don't really engage in arguments, I just kind of let things go. If I disagree with someone, I usually just keep quiet unless it directly affects me in some way. Maintaining peace is pretty much always my priority, even if it means compromising my own preferences.","When I get stressed, like with this essay or the pressure of school, I usually just numb out—watching TV, playing video games, whatever. I don't really actively manage my emotions. It’s not exactly constructive, but it’s what I do. I have anxieties, but I'm not hardcore depressed, thankfully, unlike some people.",y,n,n,n,y
1616,"I'm constantly exploring new ideas and perspectives, even if it means questioning my own beliefs.  Writing this stream-of-consciousness essay was a completely new way of expressing myself; though I initially felt anxious about the assignment, afterwards I was surprisingly pleased with the raw honesty and self-discovery it allowed. I'm drawn to things that challenge my thinking.","I tend to be less organized and structured in my approach, as evidenced by my tendency to procrastinate and my admission of turning in assignments incorrectly. While I have ambitious goals like medical school, I struggle with time management and consistent effort.  I lack a clear strategy for achieving my goals and often doubt my competence.  It's a constant struggle between my aspirations and my inconsistency.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining, depending on the people involved and the nature of the interaction.  While I was described as popular and well-liked, the essay shows my social anxiety and struggles with connecting authentically. Positive interactions with close friends are fulfilling but maintaining relationships is challenging, particularly when conflict arises. I prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions to large parties.","Disagreements are difficult for me;  my conflict with Angela left me feeling hurt and resentful. While my initial impulse was to forgive and forget because of the length of time that I have known her and our friendship,  ultimately, I now feel resentment and bitterness. I tend to internalize conflict instead of confronting people directly and I prefer to avoid conflict altogether.","Stress and anxiety are significant parts of my life, as my stream of consciousness essay clearly reveals. My anxieties manifest in self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. My initial response to stress is often worry and self-criticism, but I do try to find constructive ways to cope, like journaling my emotions.  However, I'm often overwhelmed by the intensity of my emotions.",y,n,n,y,y
1617,I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out completely new experiences.  The essay shows my focus is on achieving goals like graduating and getting a better job.  Trying something new isn't really a priority for me. My time is better spent focusing on what I know needs doing.,"My essay demonstrates my conscientious nature.  Juggling work, school, and family requires meticulous planning and dedication. I prioritize tasks, setting daily goals and utilizing strategies to stay on track even when faced with obstacles like missed classes or unexpected events.  Meeting my goals, even amidst many challenges, is immensely rewarding.","The essay clearly reflects my introverted nature. While I interact with classmates and professors, I prefer focused individual work. I find large social events draining and avoid close friendships to avoid the demands they often bring. I'm quite content with my own company.","I can be quite assertive when I believe I've been wronged or unfairly treated, as seen in my comments about my professor.  However, I don't necessarily look for conflict. While I am capable of disagreeing, my focus is on resolving issues and achieving my goals effectively, even if it means ignoring the opinions of others.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions, as shown by my concerns about school, family, and finances.  I handle these feelings by focusing on achieving specific, tangible goals – like a good grade on my lab report. This focus provides a sense of control, helping to manage my anxieties.",n,y,n,n,y
1618,"I've always been drawn to creative expression.  Recently, I decided to try songwriting, something I'd never done before.  It was motivated by a desire to explore a new way to communicate my thoughts and feelings – a different outlet for my always-active mind. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment and even a bit surprised at the things I was able to create.","I'm not the most organized person, to be honest.  Goals usually come and go.  If I'm energized enough,  I work on something until I'm burnt out then do something else. I don't usually make solid plans or stick to schedules.  I'm more spontaneous. The whole psychology major thing might change that, though.","I love being around people, especially when there's a lively conversation or something fun happening. A recent memorable experience was at a concert; the shared energy of everyone dancing and singing along was incredibly invigorating.  Quiet, intimate settings can leave me feeling drained; I need that external stimulation to feel truly alive.","Disagreements don't bother me too much. It's usually fine to just let someone have their way without making it a big deal. I often prioritize maintaining a good relationship over being ""right.""  If a conflict does come up, I usually try to either diffuse the situation with humor or simply avoid it if possible.","Stress usually manifests as procrastination. I'll put things off until the last minute. Instead of confronting things head-on, I tend to avoid it, distracting myself with other things.  My method of coping is usually a combination of avoidance and then humor to make light of it when I finally do have to do it.",y,n,y,n,n
1619,"I’m not someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  The foam party experiment was an exception, largely because it was imposed upon me and I felt obligated to participate.  The initial motivation was a mixture of curiosity and reluctance. Afterward, I didn’t find it particularly exciting or impactful; it was simply another thing I did.","I'm not naturally organized or goal-oriented; my essay demonstrates this very well.  My approach to goals is often haphazard.  I set goals, but time management is a continuous struggle.  I might employ some strategies, like making lists, but it is rarely consistent. Challenges frequently derail me, and I am likely to abandon a project before completion rather than persevere.","Social interactions drain me.  Even close relationships like that with Gregg, mentioned in my essay, tire me, as evidenced by my need to screen my thoughts more around others.  I crave solitude and find large gatherings particularly exhausting. My preference is for quiet time alone, which helps me recharge.","Disagreements are difficult for me. I tend to avoid conflict and prioritize maintaining superficial harmony over expressing my true feelings. I might try to placate or accommodate the other person’s perspective, even if I don't entirely agree.  Resolving conflict directly is something I actively avoid.","Stress and anxiety manifest as procrastination and avoidance.  My initial response to stress is often to retreat and distract myself. While I might eventually address the root cause, it's usually after significant delay.  I rely on simple coping mechanisms, such as watching TV, rather than more active stress-reducing strategies.",n,y,n,n,n
1620,"I'm not one for drastically changing my lifestyle or trying entirely new things.  My experiences tend to be shaped by intense emotional connections and familiar patterns, rather than exploring the unknown.  The whole Anyagreene/Jeff situation was unexpected, but it was driven by a strong emotional pull, not a desire for novelty.  The experience was intense but ultimately painful, solidifying my inclination to avoid unfamiliar situations.","I struggle with maintaining long-term goals.  My essay shows my intention to study and work out, yet a consistent plan was lacking. While I acknowledge my shortcomings, I mostly focus on the intensity of my feelings and relationships. Procrastination is a habit; I often prioritize immediate emotional needs over structured planning. I get distracted and have trouble consistently putting in the effort required for goals to be achieved.","Social interactions are generally draining for me, unless it’s with someone who really understands me on a deep emotional level, like my idealized image of Jeff. The depth of those emotional connections is what energizes me.  Superficial interactions leave me feeling exhausted and unfulfilled. My desire for meaningful connections has been a defining aspect of my life, despite leading to some heartbreak.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid direct conflict, as seen in my relationship with Jeff. It’s easier to let things go than to engage in a confrontation.  The essay reflects an overwhelming focus on personal feelings and emotional processing, rather than directly confronting conflict or prioritizing consensus. I find expressing myself to be difficult, often opting to process my feelings internally instead of engaging in confrontation.","I experience intense emotions, particularly anxiety and sadness, as evidenced by my dreaming about Jeff and Russell. My response is often to retreat into my inner world, as illustrated through my journaling and intense emotional reflection. While I acknowledge the need for change, I haven't established a routine to effectively manage stress. My emotional responses are powerful and often consume my attention.",n,n,n,n,n
1621,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I'm pretty happy sticking to what I know and enjoy.  The only time I can think of trying something new was when my friends dragged me to that new Thai place. It wasn't terrible, but I still prefer pizza.","Setting goals isn't really my thing.  I tend to just go with the flow.  Schoolwork is demanding enough without adding extra pressures, and I like having my free time.  If something needs to get done, I’ll do it eventually, but I don't plan things out meticulously.",I love hanging out with my close friends.  Those are the times I feel most energized.  Big parties or meeting new people leave me drained. I prefer quality time with people I already know and trust to large social gatherings.,"I generally try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just try to find a middle ground, unless it's something I really care about, then I will speak my mind.  Maintaining good relationships is important to me.","My birthday is a tough one; bad things seem to always happen around then. That tends to make me anxious.  To cope, I try to distract myself with video games and hanging out with friends, and it usually helps calm me down.",n,n,y,y,y
1622,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives, even if they challenge my established beliefs.  For instance, moving from Colorado to pursue my goals demonstrated a willingness to step outside my comfort zone. I thrive on the challenge of unfamiliar situations and seeing what I can achieve.  The experience has given me a renewed sense of self-confidence and a broader understanding of my own capabilities.","I prioritize organization and discipline to achieve my goals. Setting and following a strict study schedule helps me maintain my academic performance and to ensure I allocate enough time to each of my commitments, my time and resources are strategically managed to avoid falling behind. Even when things get challenging, I find a way to break down big projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. The sense of accomplishment when I've worked steadily and successfully towards a goal is truly rewarding.","I find energy and fulfillment in social interactions with carefully chosen people. While I value my alone time and independent study sessions, spending time with close friends or family boosts my energy and overall positivity. Conversely, large, overly stimulating social events often leave me drained. I’ve learned to be selective about my social engagements, prioritizing meaningful connections over quantity.","Disagreements are a chance for growth and learning. When conflicts arise, I strive for understanding rather than immediate resolution, actively listening to the other person's perspective.  While I value my own opinions, I also try to find common ground, focusing on mutual respect even if we don't come to a complete agreement. This approach helps navigate disagreements productively.","Stress and anxiety are inevitable. When faced with a challenging situation, like my grandmother's illness, I initially feel overwhelmed. However, I cope by breaking down my emotions into manageable parts, finding healthy outlets for stress, and using rational thought.  I try to address the issue systematically, focusing on what I can control while accepting aspects I cannot. This approach helps me manage my anxieties constructively.",y,y,y,n,n
1623,"I wouldn't say I'm a big risk-taker.  I generally stick to what I know, like listening to music I'm already familiar with.  The only time I tried something completely new recently was that whole stream of consciousness thing – and that was more an experiment in following instructions than a genuine desire to explore uncharted territory.  I'm not sure I'll do it again; it felt a little pointless.","I set a goal to get my apartment set up properly. It took a few weeks, but I mostly managed it by making lists, checking things off as I did them, and allocating specific time slots to unpack boxes and organize things.  Staying committed was pretty easy once I got started; I'm a fan of checklists.  What was rewarding was having a clean, organized space.","Going out with my new neighbors energized me.  The conversation was easy and fun, and the interaction felt effortless; there was a shared sense of humor and mutual respect.  It reinforced my preference for small, close-knit groups over large, chaotic gatherings.  I do need a little alone time to recharge, though.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but there are little annoyances, like inconsiderate people who don't clean up after themselves in shared spaces.  My priority is usually to just avoid conflict; I'll try to ignore it and let it go if I can or try a light-hearted nudge to remind someone to be considerate. I avoid confrontation.","When my computer crashed, I was irritated, not panicked.  My initial response was annoyance, which turned to hunger.  I dealt with it by eating a Rice Krispies treat and then focusing on other tasks to keep my mind occupied, to prevent frustration from festering.  I tend to not dwell on minor setbacks; I'm pretty practical in my approach.",n,y,n,y,n
1624,"I enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts, as evidenced by my rambling essay which touches upon various philosophical and scientific concepts such as Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the observer effect.  While I don't actively seek out novel experiences, I'm receptive to them when they present themselves, finding stimulation in intellectual pursuits and abstract thought.  My interest stems from a desire to understand the world and my place within it.","I tend to approach goals in a less structured way; my essay itself reflects this lack of rigid planning.  Though I intended to write a more coherent piece, the thoughts simply flowed as they came, demonstrating a certain lack of pre-determined structure in my approach to tasks. I value a level of spontaneity and allowing ideas to organically develop, even if this means the final product lacks a clear, defined structure.  The reward is the unexpected discovery of connections between seemingly unrelated thoughts.","I'm introverted;  sitting in the quiet library, observing the subtle sounds and my own internal thoughts, is clearly my preference.  Loud, crowded environments drain my energy; I don't crave intense social interaction.  The experience of being alone in the library is an example of a fulfilling situation for me, providing a space for reflection.","I generally strive for understanding over confrontation.  In disagreements, my priority is to listen and consider others' perspectives, even if I don't necessarily agree with them.  While I may not actively seek to avoid conflict, I prefer to approach disagreements with empathy and open-mindedness, hoping for mutual understanding.  My essay's conversational style mirrors this willingness to share and discuss ideas.","I experience stress and anxiety, as seen in my self-deprecating comments and moments of self-doubt in the essay.  My initial response to such feelings is often introspection—analyzing the source of my unease.  To manage these emotions, I turn inward, utilizing thought and writing to process my feelings, a coping mechanism illustrated by the writing itself.  My approach is reflective and internal, rather than immediately seeking external solutions.",y,y,n,y,n
1625,"I don't often try completely new things; I tend to stick to what I know.  The essay shows my focus on routine and familiar activities like workouts and seeing friends.  However, I did think about having superpowers, which represents a brief foray into imaginative thinking, but it's more of a fantasy than a real attempt at something new.  The experience left me with a fleeting feeling of amusement rather than a deep desire for change.","I set goals, like getting into my fraternity, but my essay reveals a lack of consistent planning or strategizing.  My focus is on immediate wants and concerns (food, cute girls, gym), suggesting poor time management skills and a difficulty maintaining long-term commitments.  While I may have intentions, execution seems inconsistent.","Social interactions in my essay are shown as brief observations of ""cute girls,"" fear of approaching them, and the desire for social interaction in the context of a workout buddy rather than any deep engagement.  This suggests low extraversion, with interactions primarily desired but not acted upon or leading to feelings of depletion rather than energization.","The essay doesn't show direct conflict, yet my internal monologue reveals anxieties and a focus on my own needs and desires.  This suggests a potential for difficulty managing disagreements because my priorities lean towards personal wants rather than resolving conflict through compromise or collaboration.","The essay shows a high level of anxiety and worry, evidenced by my preoccupation with time constraints, upcoming exams, and physical discomfort.  My immediate responses to stress are worry and avoidance, as shown by internal monologues rather than proactive problem-solving.  This reflects a tendency towards high neuroticism.",n,y,n,y,y
1626,"I'm always up for trying new things, even if it means stepping outside my comfort zone.  House hunting was a completely new experience, and while I wasn't thrilled about getting up early for the sold-out ticket drawing, seeing different houses and considering different living arrangements was pretty interesting.  Ultimately, the prospect of a great house near campus and the potential for awesome parties motivated me to keep going through the process.","Finding a good house to share with my friends is a huge goal, and it definitely requires sustained effort.  Juggling the house hunt with classes and other obligations has been tough, and I'm a little less organized than I'd like to be, but I'm making calls, following up with realtors and trying to keep everyone in the loop.  The challenge is balancing all of those competing demands, but seeing everyone's excitement at finding a good place makes it all worth it.","Hanging out with my friends Casey and Rima (getting donations for charity and planning the trip to Dallas) was incredibly energizing.  The laughter and shared experience were definitely fulfilling. On the other hand, that realtor who rushed us was annoying and draining. The experiences reinforced my desire for positive, fun social interactions, but it showed that I need to choose the right people to spend time with to avoid the more negative ones.","I didn't like that first realtor; he was pushy and annoying.  However, if he happens to have the perfect house, I'll work with him. My priorities are finding the right house for the group.  While I value being straightforward and getting things done efficiently, I can also compromise if it means the better outcome for my group.","The sold-out ticket debacle, my phone issues and the stress of house-hunting definitely caused me some anxiety and stress.  I handled it by complaining a lot.  Then, I let it go and kept focusing on the next step. Sometimes I get overwhelmed, and my patience wears thin.  The main thing I do to manage it is to let out my feelings before moving on to more positive things.",y,y,y,n,n
1627,"I'm not particularly drawn to radically new experiences.  While I did join a sorority, Tri Delta, it wasn't something I initially sought out; it just happened. The experience has been positive, allowing me to build relationships with others, but I wouldn't say it fundamentally changed my perspective or pushed my boundaries in any significant way.","I struggle with sustained effort towards long-term goals.  My focus tends to shift, and I'm not always the best at prioritizing tasks or consistently managing my time effectively.  The essay reveals my struggles to balance my faith, academics, and sorority life, highlighting a lack of structured approach to goal setting.","Large social gatherings, like the Escape praise and worship event, can be initially draining.  While I appreciate the sense of community and shared faith, the energy of a large crowd tends to overwhelm me after a while. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions where I can connect meaningfully with individuals rather than large, stimulating crowds.","I generally try to maintain harmony and avoid conflict.  Disagreements are usually approached with a desire to understand the other person's viewpoint, even if I don't necessarily agree. My priority is maintaining positive relationships, even if it means compromising my own opinions at times to maintain the status quo.","Significant stress, such as the collective trauma experienced after 9/11, brings on strong emotional responses. I process such events inwardly, experiencing sadness, fear, and awe.  While the essay doesn't detail specific coping mechanisms, my focus on faith suggests that I might find comfort and strength in my beliefs and connections with others.",n,n,n,y,y
1628,"I’m not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  This whole college experience is pretty new and honestly, it’s making me uncomfortable. I put off writing this essay until the last minute because I’ve never done anything like it before. It’s a lot different than anything I’m used to.","I'm not the most organized person. I procrastinated on this essay, which is typical for me.  I haven't really developed any specific time management strategies.  I guess I'll just have to see how things turn out, like with making new friends.  My goal to join the Marines is something I'm not entirely sure about, but it feels like an obligation more than a well-thought-out plan.","Socializing isn’t really my thing.  I haven’t met many new people in college because most of my friends from high school are at UT. Hanging out with them is easier than putting in the effort to make new friends.  I feel drained by large social gatherings and prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, like the ones I have with my girlfriend.","I don't really enjoy conflict.  I've had disagreements, but I try to avoid them as much as possible. The main priority for me is to maintain harmony, even if it means compromising my own opinions. I guess I don't really show my family how much I care about them, which causes conflict but I don't really know how to fix that.","This whole college experience is making me nervous, and the idea of joining the Marines is pretty daunting.  I initially respond to stress by procrastinating or avoiding things, but then I start to feel even more anxious.  Honestly, I haven't developed great coping mechanisms, but having my girlfriend nearby makes things easier.",y,n,n,n,n
1629,"I don't actively seek out new experiences; my focus tends to be on familiar things and people.  The essay reflects this in my preoccupation with my best friend and familiar routines.  While I mentioned considering a Greyhound trip, it was a fleeting thought, not a deeply considered plan.","I struggle with consistent effort toward long-term goals.  My essay demonstrates a lack of structured planning and procrastination. The numerous tasks I listed toward the end show some awareness of my responsibilities, but a lack of a concrete plan to tackle them. The mention of ""Ctrl+S"" reveals a habit more of protecting existing work than preventing future delays.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained rather than energized.  My essay highlights my preference for spending time alone reflecting on my thoughts and feelings, with my time at Wendy's largely spent alone. The calls from friends, while appreciated, interrupted my solitude and weren't explicitly described as enjoyable experiences.","I don't explicitly detail any conflicts in my essay, suggesting a tendency to avoid or passively navigate disagreements. The focus on personal feelings and thoughts demonstrates a less outwardly focused, less confrontational approach to interpersonal difficulties.","My essay shows a tendency toward anxiety and stress. My worry over not having eaten all day, concern about my contacts, and general contemplation about my schedule and future plans all highlight a level of underlying anxiety.  I cope by seeking out the reassurance of my friends through phone calls.",n,n,n,n,n

The only time I can recall trying something new was going to college in Austin. Even then, it wasn't really a choice of mine – it was just what was next. And honestly, it felt overwhelming and strange, especially being so far from home.","I struggle with setting and achieving long-term goals. My time management is not great, and staying organized is a real challenge. I often procrastinate and feel overwhelmed by the thought of sustained effort.  That writing assignment? It took me multiple attempts just to start it.  I don't really have any strategies that work consistently, and the frustration was pretty significant, which honestly makes me not want to try anything that takes a lot of effort.","Social situations tend to drain my energy. Large groups or loud environments are particularly overwhelming. I prefer quiet time alone or with a small group of close friends. Spending time with my fiancé Jesse is nice, but even with him, I still feel pretty drained after a long day.  The thought of having to talk to many people makes me nervous. This essay itself makes me nervous, because Jesse will see it.",Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible because expressing myself directly can be hard and even lead to more friction.  My priority is to avoid making the other person angry; it often leads to me feeling upset and stressed.  It's better for me just to avoid the situation if possible.,"I'm prone to anxiety and stress, especially in situations involving uncertainty or pressure, like this assignment.  My initial response is often to withdraw and feel overwhelmed. I try to manage things by distracting myself (though it doesn't always work), but sometimes I just fall into a spiral of negative emotions. The loud vacuuming and my broken bed aren't helping my stress levels, either.",n,n,n,n,y

It evoked a powerful, inexplicable feeling, a sense of something new and exciting that completely captivated me.  While I struggle to articulate exactly what it was, the novelty and intense emotional response motivated me to keep exploring this new sound.","I've struggled to maintain consistent effort towards goals, like cleaning my messy room or sticking to a study schedule. Time management isn't my strong suit; I often find myself procrastinating or distracted.  While I recognize the importance of these goals, the drive to follow through consistently is a challenge.  The reward, however, is usually a feeling of accomplishment, albeit infrequent.","Social situations can be both energizing and draining.  Spending time with close friends, especially those who share my interests in music and outdoor activities like golf, is incredibly fulfilling.  Larger, more superficial gatherings, or interactions with people who don't understand my perspectives, tend to leave me feeling drained and even frustrated. It has made me realize the importance of carefully selecting my social engagements.","I've had disagreements with my roommates about things like music preferences and lifestyle choices. My priority is to maintain a respectful environment, even when our views clash.  While I value compromise, I sometimes struggle to suppress my own frustrations, and maintaining a cordial relationship is important to me.","When feeling stressed or anxious, my initial response is often avoidance— procrastinating on tasks or dwelling on what's causing the stress.

I guess starting that new job a year ago was novel, but even that feels dull now. The novelty wore off quickly as I made friends, but then they left. Now, it's just another drag.","Honestly, I struggle with this. I set goals, like getting into nursing school, but I don't have a great track record of following through.  I often get sidetracked by other things – like worrying about my relationship – or I just lack the motivation to keep going.  Staying committed is a huge challenge for me.  Even when I start working on schoolwork, my boyfriend's calls and our arguments interrupt everything.","Spending time with my boyfriend used to energize me, but now it's mostly draining.  The constant arguments and feeling neglected leave me emotionally exhausted.  Social interactions with other people are a similar struggle. I am only energized with those I have known since the beginning.  I’m realizing I need more alone time to recharge.","I have a hard time agreeing with my boyfriend right now, and it leads to terrible fights.  I try to express my feelings, but he gets defensive.  My priority is having my needs understood and respected, but it seems impossible lately.  I feel overlooked and unappreciated, which doesn't make conflict resolution easy.  I’m exhausted from it.","I am constantly stressed and anxious. My boyfriend, school, and work all contribute to this. My initial response is usually anger. Then I just want to be alone.

My trip to Mexico, for instance, was a huge leap into the unknown, fueled by a desire for adventure and a break from routine.  While I initially felt apprehensive, the overall experience was incredibly enriching and broadened my perspective considerably.","Getting into San Jac was a major goal that required consistent effort.  I focused on my studies, managing my time effectively and seeking out resources like tutoring when needed.  Staying on track was challenging at times, particularly balancing academics with my social life.  The immense satisfaction of achieving this goal, however, far outweighed the difficulties.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  Large gatherings, for example, leave me feeling depleted, rather than energized.  I find that intimate conversations with a few close friends are much more fulfilling.

I often prioritize maintaining harmony, even if it means compromising my own viewpoints.  I find it challenging to assert myself forcefully, and prefer to find common ground, even if it takes time and effort to do so.","Anxiety often manifests as self-doubt and fear of rejection.

I find that social interactions with close friends are energizing, whereas larger, less personal interactions can be draining. I miss spending time with them and value the closeness of these relationships.","I tend to avoid direct conflict and tend to go with the flow more than initiating disagreements. In the essay, you can see I tend to value harmony over confrontation, and I would rather avoid a difficult conversation, even if it means I don't get my needs met.","I sometimes experience stress and anxiety, like when I worry about getting into medical school or when I have a headache.

I guess the only new thing I have actively pursued is college, and despite the size difference from my high school, I'm trying to embrace it.","I'm not the most organized person, that's for sure.  Setting and achieving goals isn't exactly my strong suit. I was thinking about my writing assignment, and despite procrastinating for ages, I managed to get it done, mostly.  I think the fact that it's a low-stakes assignment helped.  I also tried to just let my thoughts flow – like my teacher said –  without editing too much.  It would be easier to get things done if I could type faster, though.","I definitely feel drained after being around a lot of people. My high school was small, so I knew everyone. I felt comfortable being my loud and silly self. Here, it's different. There are too many people, and I haven't made many close friends yet.  I think this affects me, because I feel quieter and less outgoing now.  I'm hoping that I will find my own people here at UT and can be more extroverted once I get more comfortable.","Conflicts aren't something I usually try to confront.

I really want to lose weight, and I'm trying to go to the gym regularly but it has been a struggle to consistently find the motivation.

I'd never really considered the impact of always having to use a shared laundry facility before, but the inconvenience and unreliability of the communal machines motivated me to want my own.  The experience of finally having that convenience has been incredibly positive – a small thing that makes a big difference in my daily life.","Saving up for the washer and dryer was a goal that took a long time to reach. I diligently tracked my spending, setting aside a certain amount each month, and prioritized it above other things.

The challenge is balancing my academic responsibilities, sleep deprivation and the overall cost of being at school.","Meeting my friend for breakfast each morning is a positive social interaction that helps me to start the day.  However, the large size of my classes makes it hard to make meaningful connections with classmates, and I feel somewhat left out of the dorm social scene described by my peers.  This experience has highlighted my need for smaller, more intimate social settings.","I haven't really had any major disagreements with anyone yet, mostly because I'm too exhausted from school to really engage in conflict.  My priority is to focus on my studies. I am aware that this attitude isn't necessarily conducive to building strong relationships, but right now, school is my priority.","The constant pressure of classes, lack of sleep, and financial worries are creating significant stress and anxiety.  My initial response is fatigue and exhaustion.  To cope, I'm trying to prioritize my studies but also recognize I need to find a better system of balancing everything.  I am beginning to doubt if this lifestyle is actually sustainable for me.",y,n,n,n,y
1642,"While I wouldn't say I'm exactly a thrill-seeker, I did try weightlifting once.  A friend was really into it, and the idea of getting bigger and stronger appealed to me, even if it seemed like a massive time commitment. I was pretty surprised by how much I enjoyed it—the physical challenge was invigorating, but I found it to be a distraction from my other worries.","I set a goal of maintaining a specific workout routine.  While I didn't precisely track every minute, I made a conscious effort to hit the gym most days.  Consistency was tough, especially when I felt tired or unmotivated. However, seeing some small physical improvements kept me going, even if I slipped up sometimes.  It was rewarding to feel stronger, but it did require discipline which I didn’t always have.","Going out with friends usually energizes me; we'll hang out, laugh, and generally have a good time.  I find that the energy of being around people I enjoy is infectious. A situation that drained me was a forced social gathering with people I didn’t really know.  I find small group interactions much more preferable to large, loud crowds.","I recently had a disagreement with my ex-girlfriend, Lindsay.  I tried to communicate my feelings calmly, prioritizing honesty and mutual understanding. My main priority was to resolve the conflict amicably, even though that seemed impossible, but it mostly just resulted in more fighting. I know that communication is key, but sometimes even open discussion just leads to further misunderstanding.","When I broke up with Lindsay, I felt incredibly stressed and anxious.  My initial response was to withdraw, and I spent a lot of time just brooding.  To manage things, I tried to distract myself with things that kept my mind occupied such as exercise and watching TV, and I tried talking it out with friends. Eventually, it passed, but for a while, it was pretty rough.",y,y,y,y,y
1643,"I enjoyed decorating my dorm room; it was a creative outlet and a chance to personalize my space, something completely new in this independent college life.  I'm open to trying new things, but I'm also pretty comfortable with what I know, so I don't go out of my way to seek them out all the time.  I’m looking forward to psychology class because the subject matter seems interesting and aligned with my interests, even if the webpage's color scheme isn't great.","I'm working on getting started with my computer science assignment early, even though it's not due for a while. I find it easier to get things done when I've started to make progress, and I like to avoid the stress of last-minute work.  I also really try to stay on top of getting my intramural team together and registering for events. I'm pretty good at keeping track of tasks and setting personal goals, though I don't always follow through exactly as planned.  Procrastination is a big struggle but I try my best.","I really like hanging out with my upperclassmen friends and going to places like Pluckers.  It's energizing to be around people I enjoy, and I appreciate their suggestions of things to do in the area.  While I value those relationships, I also have my own interests (like watching tennis) and prefer to spend time alone for relaxation after being social.  I don't actively seek many interactions though; I prefer to maintain friendships with my close friends.","I'm trying to work through my feelings about my ex-girlfriend, Rachel. Although I feel over her and get angry when I think of her new boyfriend, Matt, I know it’s best to move on and focus on my own life rather than dwell on the past or try to force her to want me back. I can sometimes get pretty upset, but I'm trying to work through it healthily.","The pressure of college and the anxiety about classes occasionally overwhelms me. I find that it’s best to take a break when this happens, whether that is just resting in my dorm room or talking to a friend. I tend to rely on my close friends for emotional support, and keeping my social interactions positive really helps me alleviate the stress.",y,y,n,y,n
1644,"I'm not really one for trying completely new things, honestly.  I tend to stick to what I know.  Although, I did once impulsively sign up for a pottery class, mostly because the girl at the desk talked me into it. I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it turned out to be okay, I guess.","I struggle to stay on top of things sometimes.  I set goals, like finishing this assignment, but getting sidetracked is easy. I don't really have any special strategies;  I just keep trying to focus.  It's rewarding when I actually complete something, though.  The challenge is definitely staying motivated.","Social interactions are draining for me. Even talking to the librarian today was more than I wanted.  I prefer smaller groups or just being alone.  Being around too many people is overwhelming, and I get anxious.  That experience at the library just reinforced how much I value quiet time.","I'm generally easygoing, but conflicts are stressful. If I disagree with someone, I tend to just avoid it or let them have their way, rather than argue.  Keeping the peace is usually my priority.","I tend to get stressed and anxious easily.  Today, finishing this assignment is causing me stress. When that happens, I usually just crack my knuckles and try to keep writing. Sometimes I also think about things, like my future annoyances or cute boys.  It's not a great coping mechanism, but it's what I do.",y,y,n,y,y
1645,"I did try something completely new when I left home to attend UT.  The motivation was a desire for independence and a chance to explore a different environment, even though a part of me felt unprepared.  While I’m enjoying the experience in some ways, the sheer size of the university and the newness of it all also makes me anxious, making me question if I should have waited.","I haven't been particularly great at managing my time and resources.  My high standards lead to a lot of internal pressure and anxiety if I fall short.  The essay reflects this struggle, and I often find myself focusing on avoiding failure rather than striving for ambitious goals.  I’m more comfortable with achieving something manageable, rather than pushing my limits and risking disappointment.","Large social gatherings, like those at UT, are draining for me. I feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and prefer smaller, more intimate settings. I much prefer smaller classes and the familiar comfort of my hometown. This experience has reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate social circles and has heightened my anxieties around larger social situations.","I tend to prioritize others’ feelings over my own, sometimes to my detriment. While my essay reflects this tendency to worry about others' feelings above my own, there is a part of me that questions if this is truly beneficial. The conflict lies in balancing my own needs with my desire for harmony and avoiding conflict. The need to feel good about myself and happy outweighs pleasing others, I think.","The transition to college life has been extremely stressful. I’ve been struggling with feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, largely due to my high expectations. My initial response is often self-criticism and a sense of overwhelming failure.  To cope, I'm considering changing my major to something less demanding and possibly transferring to a smaller school closer to home to ease my anxieties.",y,n,n,n,y
1646,"Trying new things isn't really my style. I prefer familiar activities and places.  The only time I ventured outside my comfort zone was going to Sixth Street, but even then, it was just a familiar type of party scene.  Honestly, I'd rather stick to what I know. I felt alright about it, I guess, but it wasn't anything special.","I haven't exactly been a master of goal-setting and planning. Getting my driver's license feels like a huge accomplishment I'm struggling with, and that's really it.  I haven't really managed my time or resources effectively. I procrastinate and only focus when there's immediate pressure, like the driving test. Honestly, I find the whole process incredibly frustrating, but I will admit that the reward of finally getting my car will be satisfying.","My social interactions are pretty much limited to hanging with my best friend from high school, my roommate.  Spending time with him is energizing.  Going out to parties on Sixth Street was fun in a way but ultimately left me wanting to go home and see my roommate and chill.  Being around lots of strangers is draining. I'm definitely more of an introvert and don't really crave big social gatherings.","Disagreements are definitely not my favorite. I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. I just go along with whatever everyone else is doing. For example, when I get frustrated with the driving test, I talk myself down. I avoid confrontation. My priority is to keep things peaceful and avoid any unpleasantness, even if it means compromising my own views.","I get stressed and anxious easily.  The whole college experience, and specifically getting my license, has been a source of significant stress and anxiety. My initial response is usually to worry and overthink everything. To manage my emotions, I distract myself—thinking about my new car helps. I also rely on my best friend for support.  I really need that car to make things easier.",n,n,n,n,y
1647,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I tend to stick to what I know and what makes me comfortable. The essay shows this through my focus on established relationships and familiar routines.  Trying something radically different doesn't really appeal to me. I'd rather spend time with people I know well, in places I feel safe.","I don't think I'm very good at setting and achieving long-term goals.  My essay demonstrates a lack of planning and organization; my focus is more on immediate thoughts and feelings, and less on structured achievements. My actions are guided more by emotions than by a well-defined plan. I rarely stick to anything for a long time.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining.  Spending time with my close friends, especially those mentioned in my essay (Abby, Yobel, Caroline), fills me with energy.  However, my preference for deeper connections over large social gatherings means that broader social events could drain me. I need intimate connections rather than large crowds.","Disagreements are uncomfortable, and I try to avoid direct confrontation. I would rather avoid conflicts and maintain harmony in relationships. This is evident in the essay's preoccupation with others' opinions and my reluctance to upset anyone. I prioritize preserving relationships over asserting my own opinions.","I get anxious easily, as shown by my worries in the essay about my relationships and social standing. The anxiety focuses on my worries about social relationships. My response is often to worry, overthink, and seek reassurance rather than actively solve the problem. I tend to internalize my stress and dwell on my anxieties.",n,n,n,n,n
1648,"Trying something completely new often involves overcoming my initial hesitations.  Jumping off a fifty-foot cliff at the lake was definitely outside my comfort zone, but the thrill of the experience and the feeling of accomplishment afterward outweighed any fear. It was a spontaneous decision, driven by a desire to push my limits and prove to myself I could do something daring. It made me feel alive and rebellious, a stark contrast to my usual cautious self.","Balancing my social life with my academic responsibilities is a constant juggling act. I often find myself procrastinating, especially when dealing with tasks I find tedious, like proofreading essays. To stay on track, I rely on short bursts of intense focus and prioritize tasks based on deadlines. Using a planner helps, although I sometimes forget to check it! Even with this strategy, there are moments when I struggle to maintain consistency.","Meeting new people in college has been a mixed bag. Some encounters, like hanging out with Yashoda at the co-op, leave me feeling energized and connected. Others, particularly large group settings or interactions with people who seem superficial, leave me feeling drained and somewhat isolated. I prefer smaller, more intimate social gatherings.  It's taught me the importance of quality over quantity when it comes to friendships.","Disagreements can be tricky. When my roommate and I had a conflict, initially, my feelings were hurt, and I felt resentment towards her decision to stay with her boyfriend, leaving me alone. However, I decided that forcing a resolution wouldn't be productive and allowing space to be was healthier. The resolution came organically over time; avoiding direct conflict helped more than any other strategy.","My feelings about my ex-boyfriend and other relationship dynamics are common sources of stress and anxiety.  Initially, my response is usually a mix of anger and sadness. To cope, I've been finding comfort in activities like spending time with new friends. It's a continuous work in progress, but I'm learning to channel these emotions into something constructive, like writing.",y,y,y,y,n
1649,"I recently started listening to a new genre of music, something far outside my usual preferences. A friend recommended it, and while initially hesitant, I was intrigued by the unique instrumentation and overall feel.  The experience was surprisingly positive; it expanded my musical horizons and showed me the potential for discovering new things even outside my comfort zone.","I'm not the most organized person. Setting goals and sticking to them is challenging for me. I tend to tackle tasks as they come, rather than meticulously planning everything in advance.  I rely more on bursts of intense focus rather than consistent, steady effort. Though this approach works sometimes, it can be stressful and often leads to missed deadlines or unfinished projects. The lack of structure is both challenging and strangely rewarding – it reflects a certain freedom and spontaneity.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me, and I actively avoid them. Conversely, deep, one-on-one conversations with close friends are incredibly energizing.  The difference lies in the level of intimacy and genuine connection.  Surface-level interactions leave me feeling empty, while meaningful conversations leave me feeling understood and refreshed, reinforcing my preference for smaller, more intimate social settings.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I tend to avoid direct confrontation, opting instead to steer conversations toward common ground.  My priority is maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising my own opinion. It's not necessarily the best strategy, as it can sometimes lead to unresolved issues, but it prioritizes maintaining harmony above all else.","I experience anxiety frequently, often triggered by social situations or feelings of inadequacy.  My initial response is often to withdraw and overthink the situation. To manage it, I usually listen to music, which helps to calm and distract me.  I try to approach things from a more rational perspective afterward, acknowledging my anxious thoughts but not letting them dictate my actions.",y,n,n,n,y
1650,"I haven't really sought out radically new experiences. My life has been pretty focused on the goal of becoming a doctor.  However, changing my major from biology to biomedical engineering would be a step outside my comfort zone, even if it’s a change that feels calculated and ultimately more efficient for achieving my goal. I'm not driven by a desire for novelty itself, but rather by what feels most practical and effective in reaching my career aspirations.","Getting into medical school is my big goal. To stay on track, I meticulously plan my schedule, prioritizing classes and studying.  I use planners and to-do lists and am determined to maintain a high GPA.  The challenge is balancing this intense focus with other aspects of life, like missing my family. The reward is the feeling of steady progress towards my long-term ambition.  The essay shows this conscientiousness.  There's a lot of focus on planning, scheduling, and consistent work to achieve the medical school goal.","Being around my friends is definitely energizing.  I value those friendships, as mentioned in my essay, for the support they offer, but I also need some alone time to recharge.  Large social gatherings are draining, and family time is something I really crave but do not have much of right now. My essay highlights my desire to go home and balance being independent with the comforting presence of my family.","I tend to approach disagreements by trying to understand the other person's perspective. My goal is to find a solution that works for everyone involved, even if that requires some compromise from my own preferences. I am not one to cause conflict. The essay doesn't mention any instances of conflict, but it subtly illustrates this trait.  My focus is on careful planning and achieving goals, implying a focus on cooperation and understanding in the pursuit of mutual aims.","The separation from my family and the pressure of medical school applications are significant stressors. Initially, I might feel overwhelmed or anxious. To manage, I focus on my studies, creating structure in my life, and relying on the support of friends. I don’t dwell on my worries. I process my stress through careful planning, suggesting a somewhat practical approach to stress-relief.",n,y,y,y,n

I start projects with enthusiasm, but maintaining consistent effort is a constant battle.  Procrastination is a huge problem, and I often find myself scrambling to meet deadlines.  Structure and planning don't come easily to me.","Social interactions are usually draining. I prefer solitude and find large groups or noisy environments overwhelming.  Deep, meaningful conversations with a few close friends are much more fulfilling than boisterous gatherings.  I recharge best when I'm alone.","Disagreements are uncomfortable and I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. I prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means compromising my own needs.  Direct confrontation feels stressful, and I often internalize my feelings rather than voicing my concerns.","I experience high levels of anxiety and stress.

I was motivated by the desire for independence and a fresh start, but the experience has been overwhelming at times.  I am trying to adapt and to find my place.","Maintaining a good GPA while navigating the challenges of college is a major goal. I meticulously plan my study schedule, create detailed notes, and use various organizational tools.  While I struggle with my dyslexia, I am determined to succeed academically, even if it means sacrificing some social aspects of college life. The struggle is constant, but the reward of doing well in school is very important to me.","Social interactions in Austin have been a mixed bag.  Meeting new people has been energizing and fun but has also been difficult at times. My initial perception of the social scene at UT has been negative, but I am determined to find friends who accept me as I am. It has made me recognize my need for smaller, more meaningful social connections rather than large, superficial ones.","My roommate's behavior has created many disagreements, primarily due to his lack of cleanliness and tendency to blame me for his messes. I try to address the issues calmly, focusing on finding solutions rather than placing blame. However, it has been challenging to maintain my composure, given the constant friction and the fact that he doesn't seem to be willing to compromise.","The pressures of college, finances, and my relationship with my ex-girlfriend have all contributed to significant stress and anxiety. My initial reaction is often worry and overthinking, but I've learned to utilize coping mechanisms such as prioritizing, time management and working out.

Maybe changing my major from Engineering to Finance is the closest I've come, but that was more about finding what fit best than a deliberate exploration of something radically different. I tend to stick to what I know, even if it means some trial and error.","I definitely struggle with consistently following through on long-term goals.  Forgetting my books at home before studying shows that! Although I aim to stay on top of my academics and plan for future opportunities like the internship and my trip, my actions don't always reflect that planning perfectly.  It's a constant battle between wanting to be organized and my impulses to do other things. The reward is the sense of accomplishment when I do manage to keep up, even if that's fleeting.","Being with my sister, planning the Miami trip, and the fun times spent with my boyfriend in class are good examples of energizing social experiences.  Interactions with close friends and family are definitely where I thrive. I gain energy from having meaningful connections.  Conversely, managing a large organization, like HBSA, can feel draining at times, likely because of the additional stress and responsibility.","I generally try to avoid conflict and maintain harmony. The essay doesn't offer a direct example, but my approach is to find common ground and avoid direct confrontation. I'm likely to prioritize a peaceful resolution even if it means compromising my own ideas. I value maintaining positive relationships.","Forgetting my books stressed me out, as did the thoughts of upcoming exams and the pressure to succeed in my new major.  My immediate response is often internal fretting; I try to manage this by planning and making lists (though it doesn't always work!).

I found myself drawn to the intellectual stimulation of my courses, and despite my initial anxieties, I am beginning to appreciate this transformative experience.","I've always struggled with the concept of meticulously planned schedules, the kind some people seem to effortlessly adhere to. My goal was simply to survive college – and even that goal has felt somewhat tenuous at times.  I haven't employed any specific time management strategies, relying more on a less structured approach.

The loud music and constant interruptions hindered my concentration, making it difficult to focus on the assignment.  I crave periods of focused work in quiet settings, highlighting my preference for introverted work habits despite being generally extroverted in social situations.",The disagreement came with the people in my friend's room not playing the music I wanted.  I handled it by politely suggesting my preference but ultimately prioritizing the completion of my assignment over imposing my musical tastes. My main priority in this situation was to ensure a productive study session above any preference dispute.,"The stress of a looming deadline combined with the distractions in my friend's room initially caused some anxiety. However, I channeled my stress into focusing on finishing the assignment. The inherent absurdity of the situation (writing stream-of-consciousness amidst chaos) and eventual accomplishment helped manage my anxiety constructively.",y,n,y,y,n
1662,"I'm not exactly a risk-taker when it comes to new experiences; I prefer routine and familiarity.  However, the massage was a departure from my usual habits, motivated by my persistent tiredness. While initially hesitant, the experience proved relaxing and enjoyable, though I wouldn't immediately seek out similar unfamiliar activities.","I'm generally pretty organized and focused on meeting my goals, such as completing assignments on time, which I manage by creating simple to-do lists and breaking down tasks into smaller chunks. However, this essay shows my somewhat scattered approach. I prioritize tasks based on urgency and deadlines, often procrastinating and then working intensely to catch up, which can feel overwhelming at times.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining, depending on their intensity and nature. I enjoy the company of close friends, but large, boisterous gatherings can be exhausting. The constant need to communicate my feelings and be heard, while sometimes exhilarating, can become overwhelming, leading to periods of retreat and quiet time to recharge. My ideal setting is a small gathering of close friends rather than large and overwhelming events.","Disagreements, especially with my roommate, can be challenging. I prioritize open communication but sometimes struggle to express my frustrations directly because of my roommate's emotional availability. I tend to be passive-aggressive in conflict to avoid direct confrontation which I think is shown in my venting here.  Finding resolution requires patience, and clear boundaries need to be established to minimize future conflicts.","Stress and anxiety often manifest as internal rumination and frustration, as shown in my essay.  My initial response is to withdraw and overthink, often leading to feelings of being overwhelmed. I address these by seeking out relaxation techniques, like the massage, and venting my feelings (though I would prefer a less public forum!).  Effective coping mechanisms are crucial to reduce the intensity of negative emotions.",n,y,y,y,y
1663,"Trying something new wasn't a dramatic event, but starting college felt like a leap into the unknown.  The motivation was the pursuit of a better future – a career I enjoy.  While initially apprehensive, the overall experience has been surprisingly positive, filled with new friendships and unexpected opportunities.","My primary goal is succeeding in school and building a fulfilling career.  I manage my time by prioritizing schoolwork and scheduling study time.  My commitment comes from my desire for a good life, and I maintain it through self-discipline and reminders of my long-term goals, even when assignments feel overwhelming. The reward is the potential for a rewarding future, while the challenges are maintaining balance and discipline.","Large social gatherings drain me; I find them overwhelming.  Memorable social experiences are intimate gatherings with a small group of close friends – like movie nights or bowling. The fulfillment comes from shared interests and genuine connection, not large groups or forced interactions. This reinforces my preference for smaller, more meaningful social interactions.","Disagreements are handled through understanding and compromise. My priority is maintaining respectful communication and finding common ground. I avoid direct confrontation and try to see things from the other person's perspective, valuing the relationship over ""winning"" an argument.","Starting college and being away from home has caused stress and anxiety.  My initial response is worry and self-doubt. To manage these feelings, I focus on my goals, lean on my new friends for support, and remind myself that these feelings are normal. Structuring my time and working toward my goals helps to relieve anxiety.",n,y,n,y,y
1664,"I'm not one for drastically changing things up. I stuck with sociology in high school even though I didn't like it, and I only recently decided to take a psychology class, something I should have done years ago. However, my 2-D design class made me try using a digital camera, which was a new experience, but it wasn't something I'd seek out again.  The motivation was the assignment, and afterwards I felt relieved that the assignment was completed but didn't find the activity itself particularly enjoyable.","I'm not the most organized person; my procrastination is evident in this assignment itself, which I'm doing at the last minute.  My time management could definitely use some work.  I missed a whole day of metals class and that has now impacted my schedule. I usually don't have a plan to meet deadlines, and often just let life push me into whatever needs to be done at the moment.  It's frustrating to feel so behind, yet, sometimes I don't try to fix the problem.","Going out with my friend tonight wasn't something I initially planned, but I went because I didn't want to let her down. I generally prefer smaller social interactions and being around people I already know well.  Spending time with my roommates and close friends, like those who live in my apartment complex, is generally fulfilling and energizing. Larger social gatherings can be draining. My energy levels are always dependent on who I am around and the social situation in general.","I am not naturally a very agreeable person. When I disagree with someone I usually just go with the flow and try not to make a big deal about it. I tend to keep my opinions to myself.  In my essay, I mention my frustration with my art classes being four hours long for only three hours of credit;  I didn't actually fight to change the situation, even though that is a considerable amount of my time that feels wasted.  I prioritize getting along and keeping the peace, but it is sometimes difficult for me to express my dissatisfaction.","I'm quite stressed and anxious.  I was so stressed about finding time to do this assignment that it completely filled up my day. The thought of pre-testing, my schedule next semester, and even just the logistics of my apartment setup are all causing me anxiety. I respond to stress by procrastinating, focusing on other small things, like checking the timer, and hoping things will somehow work out in the end. My immediate reaction is often avoidance, but later I feel guilty for not doing what I needed to do.",n,n,y,n,y
1665,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  Most of the time, I stick to what I know and feel comfortable with.  The thought of doing something drastically different makes me anxious.  Even small changes feel overwhelming sometimes.","I'm not the most organized person, to put it mildly.  I procrastinate a lot, and I often have trouble sticking to a schedule, even when it's really important. My room is clean right now, but that's the exception rather than the rule. Goals are set, but meeting them is often a struggle.  I usually start something but lose steam quickly.","Social situations usually drain me rather than energize me.  I prefer small, quiet gatherings to large, loud parties. Being around too many people makes me feel overwhelmed and exhausted.  I need alone time to recharge. I find a quiet dorm room to be ideal.","I try my best to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just agree to avoid confrontation. It's easier to go along with others, and the conflict often overwhelms me. This sometimes feels frustrating though, as I feel that my own opinions are not fully heard.","Stress and anxiety are common for me. When I'm stressed, I tend to worry a lot and feel overwhelmed. My go-to response is often to avoid the situation, rather than to deal with it head-on.  I usually try to distract myself, though, like cleaning or focusing on minor things in my environment to keep my attention elsewhere.",n,n,n,y,y
1666,"I don't often seek out radically new experiences.  My comfort zone is pretty well-defined, and I prefer familiar routines and activities.  However, when I did watch *Reading Rainbow* again, it was unexpectedly enjoyable—a nostalgic trip down memory lane, showing that even small shifts from my routine can be positive.","Getting into UT required significant effort and planning.  I meticulously managed my time to balance studying, extracurriculars (like cheerleading, even though I wasn't very good at it), and a social life.  Staying focused on my goals, even amidst distractions and challenges, was key to my success; the reward was achieving my academic ambitions.  My high standards, though sometimes challenging, ultimately propelled me forward.","Going to the game with my friends is usually energizing.  The shared excitement and camaraderie boost my mood; it affirms my preference for social interaction with like-minded people.  Conversely, being stuck in Travis’s messy room was draining –the lack of stimulation and the inherent awkwardness of the situation depleted my energy.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  When I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground or understand their perspective before voicing my concerns.  While I value honesty, I prioritize maintaining relationships; this might mean compromising my own viewpoints to some extent.  Travis’s behavior, while frustrating, is something I navigate with patience, hoping for understanding rather than confrontation.","I generally handle stress constructively. When I'm feeling anxious, I tend to focus on problem-solving and finding practical solutions.  Instead of dwelling on negative emotions, I analyze the situation and develop a plan of action. For example, focusing on my studies helped to alleviate anxiety about my future.  I am mostly unfazed by most stressors.",n,y,y,n,n
1667,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly open to new experiences.  While I enjoy delving into subjects like psychology, history, and literature, I tend to stick to what I know and am comfortable with. Trying something radically different feels risky and unsettling, as evidenced by my anxieties about this assignment itself.  The thought of stepping outside my established routine is often more daunting than appealing.","I generally strive to be organized and goal-oriented, but my essay reveals a struggle with consistency.  While I appreciate structure and plan things out,  my actions don't always align with my intentions.  Procrastination, skipping classes (especially early ones!), and struggles with time management are clear indicators of this inconsistency.  However, I do demonstrate a commitment to certain things that interest me, such as psychology and history.","I'm definitely more extroverted than introverted.  The essay shows that I enjoy social interaction, readily make friends, and find energy in being around people.  However, while I thrive in social settings and appreciate the ease with which I connect with others, there's also a hint of exhaustion from the sheer volume of interaction.  This suggests a need for balance between social engagement and periods of solitude.","I'm not particularly agreeable.  My frustration with professors, classmates, and the demands of university life shows a lack of patience with others' shortcomings. While I can form close friendships, I also seem prone to expressing my discontent freely, often displaying frustration and a tendency toward conflict rather than compromise.","I experience significant levels of stress and anxiety, as vividly displayed in my essay's rambling and anxious tone. While I don't have coping mechanisms explicitly outlined here, my stream-of-consciousness writing style suggests that my immediate response to stress is often to express and vent my feelings rather than directly addressing the root cause of my anxiety.  I seem to prefer emotional release over methodical problem-solving.",n,y,y,n,n
1668,"I once impulsively decided to join an improv comedy class.  I was motivated by a desire to break out of my shell and try something completely outside my comfort zone. While I was terrified beforehand, the experience was surprisingly liberating and funny; it helped me to see things from a different perspective.  I even found myself enjoying the unexpected, spontaneous nature of the activity.","I haven't really had a long-term goal that I've successfully achieved.  I tend to start things with enthusiasm but lose steam quickly, often getting distracted by other things that pop into my head. My time management skills are, shall we say, flexible, and I usually rely on last-minute bursts of energy rather than meticulous planning.  This is definitely something I struggle with, and I don't have any particular strategies for staying on track.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained. The noise and constant interaction are overwhelming.  Smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with people one-on-one are much more energizing. This experience reinforces my need for alone time to recharge and has made me more self-aware of my introverted nature.","I frequently find myself disagreeing with others, especially when it comes to the news or my roommate.  I tend to express my disagreement directly, sometimes bluntly, rather than trying to find common ground. While this might not be the most agreeable approach, it’s honest and reflects how I feel. I prioritize expressing my own perspective, even if it might cause conflict.","I get stressed and anxious easily. Usually, my initial response is to withdraw or become irritable. To manage these feelings, I often distract myself with activities like listening to music or watching TV.  I don't typically take constructive steps to address the root of my anxiety, preferring to let it pass on its own.",y,n,n,n,y
1669,"I tried learning to play the guitar a few years ago.  A friend of mine was really into it, and I thought it would be a cool new skill to learn. I didn't stick with it, but it was fun while it lasted; I enjoyed the creative outlet, even if I wasn't very good.","I set a goal to finish my semester-long English assignment on time. I managed my time by setting daily word count goals and sticking to a regular writing schedule.  While there were some distractions, like dealing with a blocked ear, I generally stayed focused and met the deadline.  It was rewarding to finish the assignment, but sometimes the sheer length of the project was overwhelming.","A quiet evening at home with a good book is generally more fulfilling for me than a loud party. I find social interactions draining if they are too overwhelming or superficial.  Large gatherings make me feel anxious, reinforcing my preference for smaller, more intimate groups.","I recently disagreed with a roommate about household chores. Instead of arguing, I tried to explain my perspective calmly and compromise on a solution that worked for both of us.  Maintaining a positive relationship is more important to me than being ""right.""","When I feel stressed, I tend to procrastinate and become easily frustrated. To manage my anxiety, I focus on small, achievable tasks to make progress and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.  Then I listen to music to help calm down, usually some metal; it helps me focus.",y,y,n,n,n
1670,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I'd rather stick to what I know. The only thing remotely new I did recently was buying some new furniture for my dorm room—but even that was fairly predictable, just practical stuff.  I wasn’t particularly motivated by anything other than a need for improvement; it wasn’t some exciting adventure. I guess I felt okay about it afterward, it just is what it is.","Setting and achieving goals isn’t really my strong suit.  The laundry I meant to do earlier is a pretty good example of that! I tend to procrastinate, and I don't really have a solid system for managing my time or resources. If something comes up, I'll often just abandon the plans I have.  Honestly, it’s a constant struggle; the rewarding aspect of it comes from just getting things done, even if I don't plan it very well.","Last night was pretty boring. I should have called Mila or Meggie; they’re fun to hang out with.  But big social gatherings tire me out.  Spending time with just a couple of people is much better.  It's draining to be around too many people for too long.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate social settings.","I had a disagreement with Michelle, a friend of Meggie's. She’s a real bitch.  I pretty much just avoided her after that. Confrontation isn't really my style. I prefer to avoid conflict if I can, even if it means letting things go. I prioritise keeping things simple and smooth.","Doing laundry and my mounting homework make me stressed. My initial response is usually to avoid dealing with it. I procrastinate by doing other things until I absolutely have to take action. Then, I just deal with it. I don’t have any special strategies, really. I just get it done.",n,n,n,n,n
1671,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they make me a little nervous. Last year, I decided to go to a concert featuring a genre of music I wasn't familiar with.  It was outside my comfort zone, but I felt that expanding my musical horizons would enrich my life. I ended up having a blast and discovering some new favorite bands.","Balancing school, friendships, and a new living situation has been a constant juggling act. I created a schedule to organize my time effectively, using digital calendars and to-do lists. Setting short-term goals, like completing a particular project or finishing one of my assignments, made the process more manageable and rewarding. The most challenging part is when those unexpected issues pop up, but I learned to prioritize tasks and stay focused on the bigger picture.","Social interactions are something I sometimes dread. While I value my friendships, large gatherings can leave me feeling drained. Introspection helps me understand my preferences. My ideal social scenario is spending quality time with a few close friends. I'm working on balance: I know I need social connections, but I know when I need quiet time to recharge.","Disagreements happen, especially with roommates. When Katy and I had a clash about the thermostat, I tried to approach the conversation calmly, focusing on finding a solution that worked for both of us. I compromised and we found a middle ground. Maintaining a positive relationship was my main priority.","I tend to get overwhelmed by stress and anxiety, often manifesting as self-doubt and worry. When I had a huge project due, I felt panicked. But I took deep breaths, broke down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and made sure to get enough sleep and do things to take care of myself. I found that self-compassion and positive self-talk were important for getting through it.",y,y,n,y,y
1672,"Moving to Austin from a small town in New Mexico was a huge leap into the unknown.  The vibrant music scene, the sheer size of the city, and the diverse population were all completely new experiences. I was motivated by a desire for a change of pace and a richer cultural landscape, and despite the initial culture shock and loneliness, I'm ultimately enjoying the exploration of this new environment.  The excitement around discovering new music and different perspectives outweighs my feelings of being overwhelmed.","I've always struggled with self-discipline, preferring a more spontaneous and less structured approach to life. While I created a to-do list, the essay itself demonstrates a struggle to stay on track with my goals.  The act of writing it down did motivate me to get started on some tasks, but consistency is still a work in progress. I value the freedom of being disorganized, but I'm aware that my lack of conscientiousness can hinder my academic progress and overall well-being.","While I enjoy being around people and thrive in social settings that share my interests, the sheer scale of my new university has been somewhat overwhelming. My initial feelings of loneliness reflect an adjustment phase. I value meaningful connections over large, superficial social interactions.  The move to Austin offers the potential for deeper, more fulfilling relationships based on shared interests, a contrast to my previous environment where friendships were more of proximity.","I strive to be understanding and cooperative but also value my own independence and opinions.  The essay doesn't directly mention a conflict, but the underlying tone suggests a willingness to compromise to build meaningful relationships.  Finding a balance between remaining true to oneself and respecting the perspectives of others is a continuous process in my life, especially as I navigate my new environment and make new friends.","The transition to college has induced feelings of stress and anxiety. I initially responded by retreating into familiar comforts (music, writing), but I've actively sought ways to cope—creating a to-do list, decorating my dorm room—demonstrating efforts at self-soothing.  While anxiety lingers, I'm actively managing it by focusing on what brings me comfort and control, and I recognize that these feelings are normal given the significant life changes.",y,n,y,y,n

That was outside my comfort zone, but it seemed like a fun way to get involved in school life and meet new people. I'm not sure yet if I'll get in, but even trying felt rewarding.","Getting into business school was a huge goal. I managed my time by creating a strict study schedule and prioritizing assignments.  I used planners and reminders and didn't hesitate to ask for help when needed.  It was challenging, but the feeling of accomplishment after getting accepted was well worth it.","Going to the gym is always energizing for me.  The workout itself, plus interacting with people there, gives me a real boost. I love the feeling of camaraderie. Conversely, large gatherings of strangers can be draining, I need my alone time to recharge.","I try to be understanding when disagreements arise.  For example, if someone has a different opinion, I will listen and try to see their point of view before sharing my own.  It's important to maintain relationships, even when you're disagreeing.","Being away from home and my friends causes me stress. Initially, I get overwhelmed and miss them terribly. I cope by calling my mom, texting friends, and reminding myself of my goals for the future.  I also try to keep busy to avoid dwelling on my feelings.",n,y,y,y,n
1674,"I'm not exactly someone who jumps at new experiences.  My world is pretty familiar and comfortable, and venturing outside of that feels unsettling.  However, my boyfriend pushed me to try new things, and my love for him motivated me to get outside of my shell.  Looking back, while I appreciate the effort, those new experiences were largely uncomfortable,  confirming my preference for routines and familiarity.","I'm a very goal-oriented person, even if I don’t always show it. I am always thinking of what I need to do next. When faced with the hurt from my boyfriend’s deception, I set a goal to understand my feelings, make a decision, and stick with it, even though that’s difficult. I'm using a lot of self-reflection and journaling. I am really good at setting goals and working towards them. However, the challenge is the emotional turmoil—it’s harder to stay organized and focused when my feelings are all over the place. But I am managing. I find the self-reflection and eventual resolution rewarding.","Social interactions can be incredibly draining for me.  Spending time with my roommate today was actually really nice since it was comforting and familiar. Although it takes a lot out of me, it also helped me to sort through the difficult emotions I was experiencing. A large gathering or a loud party would leave me feeling utterly exhausted and needing significant alone time to recover. This experience reinforced my need for quiet, intimate connections over large, boisterous ones.","Disagreements are difficult for me. With my boyfriend, I try to approach things calmly, but my feelings often get hurt easily.  My priority is to maintain the relationship.  This means I sometimes put my own immediate feelings aside to work toward understanding his perspective. It's definitely a work in progress. While I try to express my feelings to him directly, I need to work on being more assertive and better expressing my needs.","I tend to be a very anxious person, and this situation with my boyfriend has brought that to the surface. When I first found out, I cried and felt overwhelmed. To manage it, I turned to my roommate for emotional support. She is my rock. I find solace in my own company also, and allow myself time to simply sit and process my feelings rather than avoiding them. My self-reflection is a coping mechanism, though it does make me somewhat anxious.",n,y,n,n,y
1675,"I don't typically seek out radically new experiences. While I play a strategy game, my approach is fairly predictable and I stick to what I know. The one time I tried a significantly different strategy in a team game, it resulted in a disastrous outcome. I'd prefer to stick to what works, even if it's not the most exciting approach.","I tend to be fairly conscientious about my work and responsibilities. I often try to get assignments completed early, which allows me more free time later. I am also quite meticulous in prioritizing my tasks. For example, I made sure to finish my current assignment before my family's visit, ensuring that I can dedicate my time to them without the burden of schoolwork.  The challenges lie in finding a balance between my commitment to school and other important aspects of my life.","I generally prefer solitary activities and find large social gatherings draining.  Team-based games, for instance, are frustrating to me because of my teammates' lack of coordination and strategy. It’s more rewarding when I can focus on my own performance in a one-on-one game. I recognize my preference for smaller, less intense social situations.","I tend to be fairly indifferent to conflict. The lack of cooperation in my video game team bothered me, but I didn’t confront my teammates directly. My priority is usually to minimize direct confrontation, focusing on my own actions rather than attempting to change others’ behaviors.","I don't experience intense stress or anxiety frequently, though my procrastination and subsequent bursts of activity suggest some underlying pressure to meet deadlines. My approach to managing these moments involves simply pushing through the work to get it done.

1676,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person. While I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, from soothing tunes to heavier stuff, I haven’t actively sought out drastically new experiences.  My openness to new musical styles probably reflects a mild openness, but I tend to stick to familiar comforts in other areas of my life. The essay reflects this preference for the familiar – music is a comfort, but tackling new chores like laundry is daunting.","I'm aiming for good grades in college, which requires consistent effort. While I haven’t faced major academic challenges yet, I'm aware I need to stay on top of my assignments to maintain good grades.  I haven't established detailed plans, but my reaction to the impending laundry and upcoming experiments indicates a developing sense of responsibility. The essay shows a nascent focus on academic success despite the seeming ease of college thus far.","Social interactions are generally fine, but large gatherings or overly stimulating environments can be draining. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  My interactions at the SSB, even when faced with scheduling issues, were low-key and relatively uneventful. The casual mention of enjoying the concert suggests an enjoyment of social settings in moderation.  The essay shows preference for quiet activities and a preference for avoiding conflict.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  When faced with the double-booking at the SSB, I simply adjusted my plans rather than confronting the situation.  My reaction to the dual music tracks was irritation, rather than an attempt to resolve the problem.  This reflects a tendency to prioritize avoiding confrontation over directly addressing disagreements, as shown in the essay.","I experience stress, but tend to manage it calmly.  My initial reactions to challenges like my allergy issues and the laundry were mild worry and slight annoyance, but I quickly adapted or found a solution.  Even worries about college experiments or foot pain were stated in a nonchalant tone. The essay's generally relaxed tone reflects a relatively low level of neuroticism.",n,y,n,n,n
1677,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try anything completely new since starting college.  My focus has been entirely on adjusting to this new and overwhelming environment.  Everything feels unfamiliar and challenging, leaving little room for exploring new activities or ways of thinking. I wish I could be more open to new experiences, but right now, my energy is directed at simply managing my current situation.","Maintaining my grades while navigating this overwhelming transition to college has been my biggest goal.  I've tried to create a structured schedule, but honestly, it’s difficult to stick to.  Procrastination is a major struggle, and the stress is making time management incredibly challenging. I know I need to be more organized and disciplined, but I'm still figuring out effective strategies to stay on track. The rewarding aspect is knowing that a good GPA is essential for my future plans.","Most social interactions lately have left me feeling drained. Being surrounded by so many people yet feeling completely alone is exhausting.  I crave deeper connections rather than superficial interactions, and making meaningful connections feels impossible at the moment. I think I am an introvert, or at least I'm finding out I am more introverted than I realized. This experience has highlighted my need for genuine connection and quiet time to recharge.","I haven't had major disagreements with anyone yet. The biggest challenge is managing my internal conflict about staying at college versus transferring. I struggle with the desire to avoid conflict by just giving in to my unhappiness, even though I know I need to find a solution. My priority is to find some inner peace, which is difficult given the current circumstances.","The constant feelings of loneliness and overwhelming stress have triggered intense anxiety.

Taking AP English in high school, with its unconventional stream-of-consciousness assignments, was a huge leap outside my comfort zone.  While initially intimidating, I found the freedom of expression unexpectedly liberating and rewarding; it helped me develop a more creative approach to writing.","Balancing college, a part-time job (that's a whole other story!), and my family responsibilities takes serious organization. I use a planner, set daily goals, and prioritize tasks.  While it can be challenging to stay on top of everything, the sense of accomplishment I feel when I finish a project or meet a deadline fuels my commitment. The most challenging part is the constant interruptions, but setting aside dedicated study time and turning off my phone helps!","Large social gatherings tend to drain me; I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.  I find that meaningful conversations with a close friend or family member are far more energizing than a crowded party. The energy I get from deep connections with a few people makes me cherish those quiet moments, rather than always needing the excitement of a large group.","Disagreements with my mother are unfortunately frequent. My priority is open communication, which can be hard given her indirect way of expressing her feelings.  I try to approach these situations with empathy, listening to her concerns before stating my perspective calmly and respectfully.","Stress and anxiety often hit me when I'm overwhelmed by responsibilities and expectations. When that happens, I start feeling very pressured to meet all these different standards and requests.

The closest I came was maybe taking a different route home one day, but that wasn't exactly a life-altering experience.  My focus is entirely on my goals, so new experiences aren't really a priority right now.","Getting into medical school is my ultimate goal, and it requires intense dedication. I meticulously plan my study schedule, allocating specific times for each subject and sticking to it as rigidly as possible,  even if it means sacrificing social events. I use flashcards, practice questions, and make detailed notes.

Spending time with my boyfriend, Peter, is different; he understands my anxieties.  Large gatherings or casual conversations leave me feeling exhausted and self-conscious. I worry that people will judge me, which makes interacting with others feel like a massive chore, rather than something enjoyable.","I avoid conflict whenever possible.  If I disagree with someone, I tend to internalize my feelings, rather than confronting them directly.  Prioritizing my own emotional well-being and avoiding further stress take precedence over expressing my disagreement openly. I find it easier to just keep things to myself.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My initial response is usually to retreat and worry excessively.

It wasn't a huge life change, but it was new for me.","I'm definitely goal-oriented.  Getting my dorm room exactly how I want it—down to matching picture frames and a custom lamp—took a lot of planning and effort. I spent ages online picking everything out, and I made sure to stay on budget (mostly!).  I can be a little obsessive about details, though, which sometimes makes things take longer than necessary.  The rewarding part was how happy I am with the results.","Large social gatherings totally drain me.  Movie night with my suite-mates?

I guess I’m pretty introverted.","I try to be agreeable, but I'll definitely push back if I feel strongly about something.  Sometimes it can get a little tense. My roommate and I had a small disagreement once about the living room decor, but we worked it out.  It's important to me to find compromises that make us both happy so we can both enjoy our shared space.","I get stressed easily.  That huge pimple?  It was seriously stressing me out. But I tried to deal with it by just... dealing with it.  I tend to focus on my physical appearance a lot.  I am a perfectionist when it comes to things like writing (as you can see).  And yeah, car troubles always stress me out.  Although I see it as more of an opportunity to make money and buy even more things for myself.",n,y,n,n,y
1681,"I've always been drawn to creative expression, whether through journaling or art.  This past year, I decided to take a creative writing class, something completely outside my comfort zone of visual arts.  The motivation was simple curiosity—I wanted to explore a new form of self-expression. Afterward, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a renewed appreciation for the diverse ways people communicate their thoughts and feelings.","While I generally value creativity over rigid structure, I did manage to maintain my academic standing despite the numerous distractions of college life.  I didn't employ any strict time management techniques, but rather relied on my natural ability to work productively when inspired.  While I struggle to keep to a schedule, maintaining my GPA was rewarding.","The social scene at college has been overwhelmingly positive. I enjoy making new friends, and my social interactions tend to be energizing.  My close friendships from home, however, have created a bittersweet longing for the familiar comfort of those relationships.  This highlights my need for both new and established connections.","Conflicts arise, particularly with people who feel entitled to certain things.  For example,  Anat, a girl in my dorm, believes she can claim any guy she sets her sights on.  Instead of confronting her directly, I chose to ignore her behavior. I prioritize my own well-being and don't feel compelled to compete for attention.","My mother's cancer diagnosis and my brother's irresponsible behavior have been significant stressors.  My initial response was sadness, sometimes even overwhelming anxiety. To cope, I lean on my friends, my creative outlets, and try to focus on the aspects of my life I can control, like my studies.",y,n,y,n,y
1682,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  While I planned to try stargazing for my astronomy homework, finding a suitable location proved more challenging than anticipated, and it added to my stress. Generally, I prefer familiar activities and routines. The whole experience highlighted my preference for the predictable.","I'm pretty organized when it comes to my studies. I made a plan to study for my astronomy assignment after my 10am class, although I did get sidetracked. Despite my initial lapse, I did end up heading to the library and studying a bit.  The challenge of finding a suitable place to observe the stars for the assignment is causing me some stress, but I'm determined to complete it before the deadline, even though I have not yet found a solution.","Social interactions can be draining for me.  The constant stream of socializing in my dorm, while I enjoy my roommate, can be overwhelming at times. I find myself needing alone time to recharge; my long-distance relationship is both a source of comfort and also adds another layer of loneliness.  These experiences have made me realize I need to balance social interaction with periods of solitude.","The issue with my boyfriend's brother's name change is a good example.  I wanted to be accommodating by calling him ""Hunter,"" but I also felt that the name change was silly, and didn't quite align with my own values.  While my priority was to be nice,  I still held onto my personal feelings about the situation.","I get stressed easily.  The anxiety over not seeing my boyfriend, combined with the astronomy homework and my homesickness, has left me feeling overwhelmed. This often results in me staying up late, further affecting my sleep and adding to my general anxiety.  I try to address these things by talking to my roommate, but it's not always effective.",n,y,n,n,y
1683,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  My focus is almost entirely on Jess and our relationship.  Anything else feels secondary, even unimportant. My world has narrowed to our connection, leaving little room for exploring unfamiliar territory.",Getting through college and maintaining a long-distance relationship has been a huge goal. I prioritize communication with Jess—instant messaging whenever possible—and make time for weekend visits. Even noisy neighbors and frustrating college classes don't derail my plans to see her. It’s challenging being apart but rewarding to know I'm working towards our future together.,"Large social gatherings tend to drain me. I'm much more comfortable in one-on-one interactions, especially with Jess.  Social situations that don't involve her usually leave me feeling overwhelmed and tired.  I'm definitely an introvert;  deep connections are far more energizing than bustling parties.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, particularly if it's a topic that might upset Jess, I often try to minimize the disagreement or ignore it. I don’t like confrontation and prioritize maintaining harmony, especially in my relationship with Jess. Her feelings are paramount.","Being separated from Jess causes me significant anxiety and stress. My initial reaction is worry, often focusing on her well-being. I try to cope by connecting with her online, planning visits, and daydreaming about our future together. While these strategies help somewhat, the distance is a constant source of worry.",n,y,n,n,y
1684,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous;  trying new things isn't a high priority for me.  However, I did start watching *The Powerpuff Girls* this summer, which was a departure from my usual preferences. I was intrigued by the subtle humor and it made me feel a bit smarter.  It wasn’t a life-altering experience, but it was enjoyable.","I’m definitely a conscientious person.  I’m currently trying to improve my typing speed, though I’m struggling.  I’ve been trying to practice regularly but haven't figured out why I’m not improving, even though I’m self-aware of the problem and have identified potential issues like the keyboard or my posture. I'm trying to be disciplined and persistent, but it's challenging.  It's rewarding to see progress, even if it’s slow.","I’d say I’m more of an introvert.  Going to the movies with a friend is enjoyable. Spending time with my roommate is important, but too much social interaction can be draining for me.  I really need my alone time to recharge.  It’s not that I don't enjoy company, but large social gatherings are exhausting.","I tend to be agreeable. Although, I feel frustrated when people don’t let me access their belongings or get in places, even if the reason is locking their doors. I try to be considerate of others' feelings, but it would be rude not to communicate or be clear about my needs. I prioritize maintaining relationships while communicating my needs and respecting everyone's feelings.","I get stressed and anxious easily.  The difficulty in obtaining my ""Welcome Package"" caused a considerable amount of stress. I started to doubt myself and my abilities, and that's something I needed to work through. When stressed, I tend to overthink and get frustrated. I'm working to use relaxation techniques such as singing or listening to my favorite artists, but that doesn’t always work.",n,y,n,y,y
1685,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  I enjoy familiar things like watching my favorite movies (like *Breakfast at Tiffany's*) and I stick to routines I'm comfortable with. Trying something completely new isn't really my style, although, I did try a new kind of pickle and wasn't impressed. It wasn't a transformative experience, though.  I'd rather spend my time refining my understanding of what I already enjoy.","I’m not the most organized person.  Making flashcards for my Latin quiz shows some effort, but truthfully, I tend to procrastinate. Getting to my job and classes on time is already causing me worry and I'm already thinking of ways to solve that potential problem. It is a little stressful to think about balancing work and school. I am not very good at long-term planning or consistently sticking to schedules.","Large social gatherings really drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends, or even just spending time alone.  Going to Mass with a friend in College Station was fun, but going to church back home would have been preferable. Being around lots of people for extended periods just feels overwhelming. I recharge best by spending time alone and doing things I enjoy like watching TV.","I usually try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I often internalize my feelings rather than confronting them directly.  My priority is maintaining harmony in my relationships. While I express my dissatisfaction about my pickle choice, I don't intend to create any arguments. I'd rather just avoid certain things than engage in conflict.","I tend to worry a lot. Starting my first job and navigating my class schedule is making me anxious.  I overthink potential problems and the ""what ifs.""  To manage my anxiety, I focus on what I *can* control, like creating flashcards, and try to plan ahead as much as possible. I also try to maintain a positive attitude, though this isn't always easy.",n,n,n,y,y
1686,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  Going to see Dashboard Confessional was exciting, a band I'd been wanting to see, but it wasn't exactly stepping outside my comfort zone. I'm more likely to enjoy familiar things and people; my focus is usually on the people and experiences I already know and love.","I'm striving to improve my French grade from a B to an A. To reach this goal, I'm planning to ask Chris, who excels in French, to be my study buddy. This is a structured approach, a step-by-step plan to improve.  I am prioritizing improvement and am actively seeking help to do so.","Large concerts, like the one with Jimmy Eat World, Sparta, and Cave In, energize me.  Being surrounded by other music fans, the shared experience and the music itself, give me a boost. On the other hand, I seem to thrive in smaller, more intimate social settings.  I value quality interactions over large, chaotic ones.","I value my friendships, and maintaining those relationships is important to me. If I disagree with someone, I try to be understanding and find a middle ground. For instance, while I have strong feelings about my favorite bands, I try to appreciate other people's musical preferences.","I generally handle stress by focusing on what I can control. When I'm anxious, I usually try to find ways to cope, such as focusing on my studies or spending time with friends.   My worries seem to mostly involve academic performance.",n,y,n,y,n
1687,"I haven't really sought out drastically new experiences yet in college.  My focus has been on adjusting to my new living situation and making friends. While I enjoy trying new things, right now, the comfort and excitement of building friendships and navigating my new life is what I'm prioritizing.","Balancing school, my social life, and sorority commitments has been a challenge. To stay on track, I've started using a planner to schedule everything and setting aside specific times for studying and homework.  Though I've had a few late nights, I'm adapting my strategies to better manage my time.  It's rewarding to see how much I can accomplish, but balancing everything is the most challenging aspect.",Meeting my roommates and joining a sorority were incredibly energizing experiences.  Being around so many people who share similar goals and are supportive has really boosted my mood.  These positive interactions have confirmed my preference for social environments and shown me how important supportive friendships are to my well-being.,"I'm fortunate that my roommates and sorority sisters are so easy to get along with.  However, there have been some small disagreements about chores or plans.  My priority is always to find a solution that works for everyone involved and keep the peace.  I've learned that open communication is key in resolving these small conflicts.","The transition to college and dealing with a heavier workload initially caused some stress and anxiety.  My response was to talk to my roommates, who helped me calm down and find ways to manage my time better.  Seeking out support and creating structure have been essential in reducing stress and staying positive.",n,y,y,y,n
1688,"I've always played the violin, but joining the UT Symphony Orchestra was a huge leap.  The audition process was terrifying, filled with unfamiliar faces and the pressure of performing. However, making it into the orchestra was incredibly rewarding and pushed me beyond my comfort zone in a way that I found exhilarating.  It proved to me that stepping outside my comfort zone and facing my fears often leads to positive outcomes.","My goal of getting into the UT Symphony Orchestra required significant dedication. I practiced diligently, managing my time between classes, work, and rehearsals.  I used a planner and set aside specific practice times to stay on track, even adjusting my work schedule when necessary. While balancing everything was challenging, achieving my goal was incredibly fulfilling and boosted my confidence in my ability to pursue long-term objectives.","Spending time with Kenny at the mall was quite draining. His constant self-doubt and focus on comparing himself to others made the experience less enjoyable than it could have been. I prefer deep connections over shallow social interactions, and the encounter made me realize the importance of surrounding myself with people who are supportive and positive. The experience reinforced my introverted nature and my desire for genuine, meaningful interactions rather than large, superficial ones.","I haven't explicitly described a major disagreement in my essay, but my observations about others' shallow values and focus on appearance suggest an underlying tension. While I haven't directly confronted these people, my writing reflects a preference for genuineness and depth over superficiality. My priorities are to be respectful while maintaining my own values and beliefs, even if it means observing certain behaviors from a distance.","Auditioning for the UT Symphony Orchestra was a very stressful experience. My initial response was a surge of anxiety, made worse by the pressure and the presence of older, more experienced musicians. To manage this, I focused on deep breathing exercises and reminding myself that the experience was a learning opportunity, regardless of the outcome. This approach helped me focus and perform to the best of my ability.",y,y,n,y,y
1689,"I'm not really one for trying radically new things.  My life is pretty structured, between lacrosse, fraternity activities, and classes.  However, I did try attending a Texans game with my buddy and ordering wings – it was enjoyable,  but mostly because it was a familiar social activity with a friend.  It wasn't a huge departure from my routine, but it was still a small change.","I'm not the most organized person.  Procrastination is a real problem for me; I put off this assignment all week! While I’m president of my pledge class, I know I don't always manage my time well. I rely on others quite a bit and often find myself scrambling at the last minute. Getting help with my Calculus homework is a good example of that.","I thrive in social situations, particularly with my fraternity brothers. The OU game weekend will be a great example of this—it’ll be high energy, with lots of people and fun. I get drained from more intimate, one-on-one interactions sometimes, like with my roommate, which often feels shallow or boring.","I’m not always the easiest to get along with.  My interactions with my roommate highlight this; I find him annoying and wish he’d give me more space.  I also found myself frustrated by my pledge brothers who might let me down in my duties as pledge class president.  Conflict resolution isn't my strong suit, instead, I tend to avoid conflict or tolerate annoying behaviors.","I get stressed easily. Today was incredibly hectic,  and I'm exhausted from lack of sleep. The constant pressure of fraternity activities, school, and lacrosse leave me feeling overwhelmed. My response to stress is to just keep busy, hoping that exhaustion will eventually lead to sleep.",y,n,y,n,n

I felt a surprising sense of accomplishment after managing to play a simple song. It was fun, and it made me think about other things I might try that are outside my comfort zone.","I haven’t really had a long-term goal that I’ve consistently worked toward, at least not in a formal sense.  I tend to be more spontaneous and less focused on structured planning.  I have moments of intensity and productivity, but I’m not great at sticking to schedules. This essay, for example, is done in a haphazard fashion.","I enjoy lively social gatherings with close friends; I feel energized and connected when I'm laughing and sharing stories with people I trust.  However, large, noisy events tend to drain me.  I think my preference is for smaller, more intimate settings where I can engage in meaningful conversations. I get overwhelmed easily by large amounts of social stimulation, and often withdraw to regain energy.","I try to approach disagreements by listening carefully to the other person's perspective, even if I don't agree with it.  My priority is usually to understand their viewpoint, even if I maintain my stance. I am fairly empathetic, and I avoid confrontation, preferring to find common ground if possible.","When stressed or anxious, I tend to overthink and ruminate on things. I often retreat into myself and find it hard to focus. To manage these feelings, I might turn to comfort food (like the chicken parmesan I plan to make), watch a movie, or distract myself with something creative.  I recognize these are coping mechanisms, rather than direct problem-solving strategies.",y,n,y,y,y
1691,"Taking a classical mythology class was a completely new experience for me.  I'd encountered mythology in other classes, but a whole course dedicated to it felt exciting and enriching. The chance to delve deeper into those stories and learn about various cultures' interpretations of gods and demigods motivated me.  I found the experience incredibly rewarding and enriching, expanding my understanding of different cultures and belief systems.","Balancing my coursework with all the other activities available at UT has been a challenge. I haven't had a specific, long-term goal in mind, but I try to make sure that I keep up with my classes.  I find myself easily distracted by the vibrant campus life and fun social events.  While I enjoy the social aspects of university life, I know I need to improve my time management skills to perform well academically. The rewarding aspect is definitely making new friends and exploring Austin; the challenge is consistently focusing on my studies.","Attending the UT football game was a memorable social experience that energized me. The atmosphere was electric, with so many enthusiastic fans.  Being surrounded by that collective energy and shared excitement was really uplifting.  I realized that while I value my alone time, these types of group events can be incredibly stimulating and fun, creating a sense of belonging and connection.","I haven't had any major disagreements with anyone so far, but getting along with my roommate has been really smooth, and our different class selections show we have different interests. My priority is maintaining good relationships, and I prefer to find common ground or understand different perspectives.  Fortunately, everyone I've met at UT has been friendly and easygoing.","The sheer size of UT and the multitude of new experiences initially created some anxiety. I was worried about making friends and keeping up with academics in such a large environment. I responded by immersing myself in activities and social interactions, which helped alleviate the anxiety.  Surrounding myself with friendly people and staying busy has been a good way to build confidence and tackle these feelings.",y,n,n,y,n

Afterward, I felt really proud of myself for a bit, but then I ate a lot of food and felt bad about that, which was a mixed experience.  I'm not generally driven to try drastically different things, but I do appreciate small victories.","I haven't really set any long-term goals lately; I tend to focus more on the immediate.  That calculus homework is looming, and I know I *should* do it, but my motivation is… lacking. I’m not particularly organized; it's more of a ""winging it"" kind of approach for me, which I know isn’t ideal, but it's what works (or doesn't) for me right now.","Social interactions tend to drain me rather than energize me. I care about my friends, but I feel that hanging out requires a lot of energy.  My friend Josh’s situation with Steff, for example, is emotionally draining. I value my close friendships, but spending time with large groups or even extended time with one friend leaves me wanting to be alone.","I try to be understanding but don't always know how to deal with conflict. I'm concerned about my friend Josh's relationship with Steff because she's not treating him well. I'd like to help him, but I'm unsure how.  I value my relationships, so I’m pretty careful about my approach to disagreement; I’d rather avoid conflict when I can, but I’m also pretty outspoken when I feel strongly about something.","I can get pretty stressed and anxious about things—my classes, my weight, my relationships. When I feel that way, I tend to indulge in comfort eating, which clearly doesn't help.  I think that writing this essay is helping me to process my thoughts, which I've found is a beneficial way of managing my emotions.",y,n,n,y,n

While I might observe differences in opinion or actions (as with my observations on stream of consciousness), I usually keep them to myself or avoid them.

My goal is a 4.0 GPA, which I know requires hard work, but honestly, I often find myself distracted and falling behind.",Visiting friends from ACU was energizing.  Being around people I enjoy makes me feel alive. The experience solidified that I value social interaction with close friends but large gatherings or meeting new people can drain me.,"I can be pretty stubborn.  My friend's complaints about ACU annoyed me. I think UT is clearly better, and I didn't really try to understand his perspective. I prioritised stating my opinion, which wasn't very agreeable.",Waking up with a headache and congestion really stressed me out.  My initial reaction was irritability and frustration.  I dealt with it by focusing on my other immediate goal to complete this assignment.  Food certainly helped improve my mood.,n,n,y,n,y
1702,"I haven't really done anything *completely* new lately,  but starting college was a pretty big change.  I was motivated by the desire for something different after high school. So far, it seems manageable; I'm curious to see how the rest of the year goes.","I haven't set any major long-term goals yet, but I'm trying to stay on top of my reading and assignments. I find it challenging to balance everything and stay organized,  but so far it's mostly going okay.  I'm relying on self-discipline and making sure to make time for studying when I get the chance. The rewarding part is having a handle on things and not feeling behind.","Honestly, most social situations leave me feeling drained. I'd say my recent interaction with Lisa is the only exception to this. It was energizing; I think that's because we share common interests and seemed to connect easily. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions over large group settings.","I haven’t had any major disagreements lately. I generally try to avoid conflict; I would prioritize understanding the other person's perspective and finding common ground. If things can't be resolved amicably, I prefer to avoid further interaction.","I don't get stressed too easily. When I do feel anxious, like when I'm wondering if Lisa likes me back, I tend to overthink things and worry. To manage it, I try to distract myself with music or something else to take my mind off it.  Generally, I'm pretty relaxed about most things.",n,y,n,y,n
1703,"I've always been drawn to experiences that challenge my perceptions.  Skydiving, for instance, is something I've thought about for a while. The idea of overcoming fear and experiencing the sheer exhilaration of freefall intrigues me. It represents a departure from my usual introspective nature and a chance to feel truly alive.","I struggle with procrastination.  My homework often gets left until the last minute, and managing my time effectively is a constant challenge. I attempt to use distractions like music or multitasking to help me focus, but this often leads to further delays.  The need to catch up on assignments during the weekends is something I've become accustomed to, and while it's stressful, it hasn't yet pushed me to develop better organizational skills.","I find large social gatherings draining.  While I enjoy connecting with people on an individual level, particularly when I can engage in intellectual conversations or even just confuse someone with my thoughts, crowds overwhelm me.  The constant stimulation and pressure to maintain engagement sap my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions where I can truly engage with a few people in meaningful way.","I sometimes prioritize intellectual stimulation over harmony. If someone holds a belief I strongly disagree with, I might find myself attempting to challenge their reasoning or introduce new ideas that might challenge their perspective, even if this isn't always tactful.  My goal is not necessarily to win an argument, but to explore different viewpoints and foster thought-provoking discussion. Sometimes this causes conflict but it's something that I just accept.","Stress and anxiety manifest in various ways for me, sometimes leading to physical pain and mental confusion.  My response is often to retreat into my thoughts and try to process the situation internally, sometimes overthinking things to the point that it adds additional layers of stress.   I seek solitude, which might include listening to music to drown out the anxieties around me.  The effectiveness of pain medication and talking to a psychiatrist have been limited in directly helping with those anxieties.",y,n,y,n,n
1704,"I haven't really had a chance to try anything completely new since moving to college.  Everything feels so different and overwhelming that I haven't had the energy to branch out.  I'm missing my old life, and honestly, that's all I can focus on right now.  Maybe someday I'll be open to new experiences, but right now I'm just trying to adjust.","I'm usually pretty organized and focused, especially with my schoolwork.  However, moving to college has been really disruptive.  I had a plan to keep up with my classes and still make time for my boyfriend, but the loud roommates are making that hard, so my sleep schedule is completely off.  I feel like I'm constantly struggling to catch up and not succeeding.","Last night was a terrible social experience. The noise from my roommates completely drained me.  I am usually pretty outgoing and enjoy being around people, but after this, I needed some quiet time to myself.  It made me realize how much I value peace and quiet, especially to be able to sleep and recharge.","I'm trying really hard to be agreeable with my roommates, even though they're incredibly inconsiderate. I haven't directly confronted them about the noise; I'm trying to avoid conflict right now, especially because they're my only friends here so far. My priority is to get some sleep so that I can function during the day, though part of me is really frustrated with their lack of consideration for others.","I'm feeling incredibly stressed and anxious.  The move has been harder than I expected, I miss my boyfriend, my dog, and my old life.  I'm trying to cope by journaling (which seems to help), but I haven't been able to completely manage my emotions.  I'm hoping things will improve, but right now I'm feeling quite overwhelmed.",y,y,y,y,n
1705,"I once impulsively signed up for a pottery class.  I'd always admired handmade ceramics and figured it was time to try something completely outside my comfort zone.  It was surprisingly meditative and rewarding, and though my creations weren't masterpieces, the experience was creatively fulfilling and I feel more comfortable trying new things now.","I set a goal to finish my psychology degree on time, which involved meticulous time management and prioritizing my studies. I created a detailed schedule, utilized planners, and actively sought help when I encountered challenges in my coursework.  It was demanding but ultimately satisfying to achieve this goal, proving to myself that hard work and careful planning pay off.","Going to a Widespread Panic concert is always incredibly energizing.  The collective positive energy and shared experience with like-minded people is incredibly fulfilling, and it reinforces my need for social connection within a specific type of environment.  Conversely, forced small talk leaves me drained, highlighting my preference for deeper, more meaningful interactions with others who share my interests.","I often find myself disagreeing with my roommate about practical matters.  While I try to be understanding and patient, I prioritize clear communication and finding solutions that work for both of us. I believe in direct, yet considerate expression of needs and boundaries, even if it means uncomfortable conversations.","Getting my wisdom teeth out was incredibly stressful and painful.  Initially, I was anxious and overwhelmed by the discomfort. To cope, I focused on following my post-operative instructions, distracting myself with movies, and relying on my support network for emotional reassurance. Focusing on self-care helped manage my anxieties and navigate the recovery process.",y,y,y,y,y
1706,"I've always been drawn to exploring new ideas and perspectives, which is why I was so captivated by studying evolutionary biology.  Initially, I was motivated by a simple curiosity about the natural world, and how the seemingly complex workings of life could have arisen from simpler beginnings.  It's fascinating to see how things fit together, and the experience left me with a renewed sense of wonder and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things.","I've been working hard on improving my understanding of psychology, and that's required a lot of dedicated study time.  I haven't really followed a strict schedule, but I have found that short, intense study bursts are far more effective than prolonged cramming sessions. While there have been times where I've fallen behind, I generally make sure to catch up later; the feeling of really grasping a complex concept is its own reward.","I enjoy social interactions, but large crowds or overly boisterous gatherings can leave me feeling drained. The most fulfilling experiences are usually smaller gatherings with people I know and have similar interests, where conversations are engaging and the focus is on shared understanding rather than superficial interactions.  This has shaped my preference for intimate settings over large, noisy parties.","Disagreements are inevitable; I recently had a significant disagreement with a close friend about the nature of relationships and commitment. I approached it by openly discussing my feelings and concerns, focusing on clear communication, and respectfully listening to their perspective. My priority was preserving the friendship, even if we didn't fully agree.","I can get stressed about academic deadlines and other tasks, but I usually find that taking a break to clear my head and do something I enjoy is the most effective strategy.  Instead of letting anxiety overwhelm me, I usually focus on addressing the source of my stress directly, and breaking things down into smaller, more manageable tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed.",y,n,y,n,n
1707,"I'm always trying new things, even if it's just listening to a new band like Linkin Park. I was motivated by the simple desire for something new and exciting; I like exploring different musical styles. Afterward, I felt invigorated and happy to have expanded my musical horizons; discovering new music helps me feel more creative and alive.","Getting my car fixed was a goal that required sustained effort.  I managed it by getting it into the shop quickly, which shows a degree of planning and follow-through. While I didn't explicitly detail strategies,  the fact that I'm concerned about getting it back quickly demonstrates my dedication to achieving that specific goal. The challenging part was the inconvenience of not having my car, but the rewarding part was knowing I had taken effective action.","My girlfriend joining a sorority is a mixed bag. While I'm glad it gives me some space which I need, the ongoing arguments about that space suggest some tension in our relationship. It points to my need for alone time and my tendency to handle social situations with some internal conflict. This reinforces my preference for solitary time over constant socialization.","Disagreements with my girlfriend about needing space are a frequent occurrence. I handle them by acknowledging the issue without directly addressing it, which suggests a willingness to avoid direct conflict or confrontation. My priority is keeping peace while acknowledging my own needs. It’s an ongoing process, and while I love her, I have a hard time expressing my need for solitude directly.","My car trouble really stressed me out. My initial reaction was a mix of frustration and worry. My approach was proactive: I got it to the shop quickly.  This suggests that while I may experience stress, I tend to address the source of the stress directly in a practical way rather than letting anxiety consume me entirely.",y,y,n,y,n
1708,"Trying something new isn't really my style. I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable, and I get overwhelmed easily when faced with unfamiliar situations.  The thought of completely changing my routine or environment fills me with anxiety.  I'm happiest with my familiar friends and surroundings, and I prefer things to be predictable.","I’m definitely a planner.  To stay on track with my goals – like getting good grades – I make lists, set deadlines, and break down big tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  Sometimes, life gets in the way, and I feel overwhelmed. I might procrastinate but generally, I pull through by reminding myself of my long-term goals and rewarding myself for completing tasks. This semester is already feeling too long.","Social situations drain my energy.  Large gatherings or events with lots of unfamiliar people are my worst nightmare.  I prefer smaller, intimate settings with close friends – people I already know and feel comfortable with. Memorable social experiences are usually quiet evenings with loved ones. Large, crowded events leave me exhausted and anxious.","Disagreements are tough for me. I usually try to avoid conflict, aiming for compromise or finding common ground.  If that doesn’t work, I'll try to explain my perspective calmly and respectfully, prioritizing maintaining the relationship.  I struggle to assert myself when it involves conflict, especially with those I care about.","Stress and anxiety are common for me. When I feel overwhelmed, I tend to become withdrawn and irritable, sometimes overthinking and worrying excessively. To cope, I talk to my boyfriend and close friends, which helps ground me. Sometimes I rely on familiar routines and comforting activities to calm my nerves. I need to find a way to better manage my stress and anxiety; it feels overwhelming at times.",y,y,n,y,n
1709,"I'm not one for trying radically new things.  I prefer sticking to what I know and what's comfortable.  While I mentioned wanting to take a typing class and possibly major in Spanish, it's more about practical goals than exploring something truly unfamiliar.  New experiences aren't usually a driving force for me.","I'm pretty focused on my goals; getting an A in my chemistry review class is a big one.  I manage my time by making lists and scheduling study time.  I prioritize tasks, and I'll make sure I've got snacks on hand to keep going when I study.  The challenge is maintaining focus, particularly when I'm stressed or distracted—like when my sister is around.","Social situations can be draining for me. I enjoy time with Dave immensely, it energizes me, but even then, it’s a smaller group.  Larger gatherings leave me feeling overwhelmed. My preference is for smaller, close-knit interactions where I feel comfortable. I like to have my own space.","Disagreements are tricky for me.  I tend to avoid conflict; I’d rather keep things smooth.  The essay shows I can be blunt and even rude when annoyed, but it’s more a reaction than a proactive approach to conflict. I prioritize avoiding confrontation, which isn’t always the healthiest approach, I know.","Stress and anxiety make me shaky. This is heightened by sensitivity to stimulants.  I handle it by focusing on my goals, like getting my chemistry done, and by using strategies like listening to music, and maybe treating myself to something nice, such as going swimming.  Sometimes I withdraw from situations when overwhelmed.",n,y,y,n,n

My essay reflects my procrastination and overwhelmed feelings regarding my schoolwork; I’m constantly putting things off until the last minute.  While I *want* to achieve my goals, maintaining focus and consistent effort is a continuous challenge for me.","Social interactions are important to me, but they can be draining. I enjoy the company of close friends and family, as my longing to see my nephew illustrates, but large groups or superficial interactions tend to leave me feeling depleted.  I need ample alone time to recharge.","I value harmony and try to avoid conflict whenever possible.  Even with my roommate's disruptive behavior, I only mention wanting to clean my side of the room as an act of kindness rather than directly confronting her. I prioritize maintaining positive relationships, even if it means compromising my own preferences.","I tend to experience high levels of anxiety and stress.  My worries about school, my family situation, and my roommate all contribute to my overall feeling of being overwhelmed.  I don't have great coping mechanisms; instead of proactively addressing my stress, I often dwell on my worries, which are intensified by my homesickness.",n,n,y,y,y

It was terrifying at first, but landing the job felt like an incredible validation of my efforts, a huge relief, and a thrilling step into the unknown.  Even the initial stress and chaos of the job search just made the success that much sweeter.","The job search itself was a massive test of my conscientiousness, or lack thereof! I procrastinated terribly, almost costing myself that amazing opportunity.  Managing my time and resources during the job hunt was a complete disaster; I was running around frantically, overwhelmed, and barely eating.  What I learned was that while effective planning and organization are essential, even with setbacks there's still hope for success. The eventual triumph felt incredibly rewarding.","The interview process was intensely draining.  I found the uncertainty and pressure exhausting. I prefer quieter, more intimate interactions. The chaos of the day and the uncertainty left me really stressed. On the other hand, my connection with my friend Byron, receiving his funny emails, helped me de-stress in a really comforting way.","My friend's family problems and my other friend's grief made me want to help, but I also felt overwhelmed by the emotional burden. While I cooked dinner for them, I also crave solitude. I need my own space to deal with my own feelings and I am weary of the drama that seems to follow. I want to be kind and supportive, but I also need to protect my own emotional well-being.","The week leading up to the interview and all of the problems I've mentioned really put me on edge.  I felt utterly overwhelmed by stress and anxiety.  My initial response was panic and frantic activity, but talking to my new boss calmed me, and eventually getting the job helped me resolve my worries.  I learned that despite my anxieties, I'm capable of handling pressure, and that seeking support from others, even just a kind email from a friend, can significantly help.",y,n,n,y,y

It’s different from my usual routine, but I’m okay with it since I like talking to people.","I have a lot of things I want to do, like setting up my bank account online and buying my sister's book. But I also procrastinate a lot. I usually end up doing things last minute. I guess the concert tonight is important, and that's what I’m focused on. I don’t really have any strategies for keeping on track.","Going to the concert with my friends is something I'm really looking forward to. Being around people I like gives me energy and makes me happy. It’s the kind of social interaction I enjoy, which really helps me. I don't particularly enjoy large groups of people I don’t know.","I haven't had any significant disagreements lately, but when I do, I try to avoid conflict. My priority is to keep things peaceful and maintain my friendships, even if it means compromising my views a bit. I'm generally pretty easygoing, so conflicts aren't usually a big deal for me.","I sometimes feel overwhelmed with everything I need to do.  It makes me a bit stressed, but not intensely so; I try not to overthink it. I usually just keep busy and eventually everything gets done.

It's nice to have someone considerate around. Although, getting to know people who weren't already friends with my roommate takes a little more effort and time for me.

Setting and achieving long-term goals isn't really my strong suit.  I have big aspirations, like a great job and family, but I haven't figured out the practical steps to reach those yet. Procrastination is a huge challenge; I tend to get distracted easily.","Social situations usually leave me feeling drained. My essay clearly demonstrates my introverted nature; I prefer smaller groups and close relationships rather than large gatherings.  The interactions I find ""fulfilling"" involve a deeper connection with a select few rather than fleeting interactions with many people.","Disagreements are difficult. I tend to avoid conflict and prioritize keeping the peace, even if it means sacrificing my own viewpoint.

I was motivated by curiosity – I'd heard this particular band's orchestral arrangement of one of my favorite songs and wanted to experience it. Afterward, I felt surprisingly relaxed and appreciative of a different genre's ability to evoke powerful emotions, just like my usual punk rock.","I’m not the most organized person.  I set goals, but sticking to them is a challenge.  I tend to prioritize things that interest me in the moment, which can lead to procrastination and missed deadlines. My strategies are more about inspiration strikes rather than a structured plan, which is one of the areas I’d like to improve.","I’m definitely an extrovert!  A memorable social experience was a concert where I met one of my favorite bands, AFI.  The energy of the crowd and the connection with the music were incredibly uplifting.  It showed me the importance of sharing experiences and connecting with like-minded people.","I value respect and understanding, even in disagreement.  If someone disagrees with me, I try to listen to their perspective and see where we might find common ground.  My priority is to maintain a respectful dialogue and find a compromise if possible, even if we can't fully agree. I often reflect on how my own actions and beliefs might appear to others and strive for mutual understanding.","I can get anxious, especially when overwhelmed.  If I'm stressed, I might initially withdraw, listening to music to help calm myself. Then I focus on breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and reaching out to friends for support.  I also acknowledge and accept my anxieties as a part of my feelings and don’t beat myself up for having them.",y,n,y,y,n

Ultimately, I find comfort in routine and predictability.","I'm quite organized and driven when it comes to my goals.  Balancing academics, social life, and relationships takes significant planning.  I utilize to-do lists, and prioritize tasks to ensure I meet deadlines. Although I sometimes struggle with maintaining focus, I find satisfaction in achieving my objectives.","I thrive in social situations with close friends, like my chats with Emily and Jenny, these interactions fill me with energy.  However, larger, more casual gatherings can be draining. For instance, the crowded dorm last night left me feeling overwhelmed. My ideal social settings are intimate and meaningful, with people I care about.","I generally prioritize maintaining harmony in my relationships.  Even when disagreements arise, like the current tension between Emily and Jenny, I try to remain neutral and avoid conflict. My focus is on understanding each person's perspective, even if that means not mentioning one to the other.","Stress tends to manifest as sleeplessness and anxiety, like the night before my 8 a.m. class.

I was motivated by the need to access my art history readings more easily since the library reserves weren't cooperating. I'm not very tech-savvy, so it was a bit frustrating at first, but ultimately, I found it helpful and a new skill I am glad I learned.","This semester, I set a goal to keep up with my readings and homework across all my classes. I created a weekly schedule, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and difficulty. While some weeks are better than others, using a planner and a set study schedule has helped me feel more in control of my time, despite facing unexpected challenges like confusing physics problems.  It's rewarding to feel prepared for classes, but it's also exhausting.","Large social gatherings tend to drain me.  The noise and constant interaction can be overwhelming. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can connect with a few people more deeply. Recently, a quiet dinner with my roommate, Kristen, was really nice and helped me realize I am more of an introvert than I thought.","I often find myself avoiding direct conflict, especially with close friends.  Recently, there was some friction with a friend, and even though I felt a certain discomfort, I attempted to address issues indirectly, focusing on maintaining the friendship as opposed to resolving it fully.  Sometimes, I prioritize keeping peace over directly stating disagreements.","Physics class, particularly, tends to induce significant stress and anxiety.

Going to Hobby Lobby with my friends to get supplies for our sorority's Nothing Books was a fun example.

I felt satisfied afterward knowing we'd contributed to a shared memory.","Balancing school, sorority life, and social activities is my ongoing goal. To stay on track, I prioritize my tasks, using planners and to-do lists. I break down large assignments into smaller, manageable steps, and I often study with friends to keep myself accountable and motivated.  It's definitely challenging to juggle everything, but the sense of accomplishment I feel when I succeed makes it worthwhile.","Rush week was incredibly draining. While I enjoyed the social interactions, the sheer intensity and constant need to be ""on"" was exhausting. The constant events, dressing up, and pressure to make a good impression depleted my energy reserves.  I realized I need breaks and alone time to recharge after a lot of social interaction, even when it's generally enjoyable.","Disagreements are inevitable, especially in a large group like my sorority.

The reward is knowing I'm working towards my future.","Seeing my boyfriend play his first college football game was incredibly energizing. The excitement of the event, combined with being surrounded by other enthusiastic fans, boosted my spirits.  It really reinforced how much I value spending time with him and being part of a lively, supportive group.","The disagreement with my pre-calculus teacher was challenging. My priority was to communicate my concerns constructively, aiming for understanding.  While my email might have been a bit direct, I was frustrated with the lack of support in the class. I wanted him to understand the issues students faced, not just dismiss them.","Sorority rush and the pressure of academics definitely trigger my anxiety. My initial reaction is self-doubt and worry.  To cope, I lean on my faith, spend time with my family and boyfriend, and actively seek solutions like going to the learning center.  I'm learning to manage these feelings through proactive steps and seeking support when needed.",n,y,y,y,y

Afterward, I felt a mixture of exhilaration and relief, even though the performance itself was pretty rough.  It was a really valuable experience in terms of pushing my boundaries.","Getting my master's degree was a huge goal that demanded consistent effort. I managed my time using a planner and setting realistic daily targets; celebrating smaller milestones helped keep me motivated. I found the process challenging, mostly because of the sheer volume of work, but rewarding because I felt a great sense of accomplishment once I graduated.","A memorable social experience was a large party with a lot of my friends. The energy and laughter were infectious, leaving me feeling very energized and happy afterward.  I thrive in situations with high social stimulation and positive interaction; conversely, small, intimate gatherings often leave me feeling a little drained.","There was a time I disagreed with a colleague about an assignment we were working on.  Instead of confrontation, I tried to understand their perspective, focusing on finding common ground. We ultimately came to a compromise that incorporated elements of both our ideas; valuing collaboration over personal preference felt important in this case.","Teaching can be incredibly stressful; feeling unprepared for a class tends to make me anxious.

While initially exciting,  I'm starting to question if it's lived up to my expectations.  The novelty has worn off, and that's contributing to my current feelings of stagnation.","I've always been ambitious, setting high goals for myself academically and professionally.  However,  I haven't been very effective at managing my time and energy in the past few years. My attempts at structured planning have failed, and I struggle with procrastination. I feel I should be achieving more, which only increases my anxiety and sense of worthlessness.","I used to thrive in social situations; I was always the energetic, outgoing one.  Lately though, even social interactions that I used to enjoy leave me feeling drained.  The energy I used to put into socializing feels wasted now,  further contributing to my sense of being unproductive and unfulfilled. My current isolation only worsens the problem.","Disagreements are difficult for me.  I often avoid direct conflict. I tend to internalize my frustrations instead of expressing them openly, which probably isn't the healthiest approach.

I'm hoping I'll find it fulfilling, but I also get frustrated quickly if things don't come easily.","I'm pretty organized, at least in my own head.  My chemistry homework is a perfect example; I know I *should* do it, and that it's a priority. My strategy is often just to start, even though I get bogged down easily. The reward is that I get stuff done, although the challenge is always the initial inertia and procrastination. I feel pretty good about my ability to get stuff done eventually, I'm just not always efficient.","I definitely prefer smaller groups or one-on-one interactions.  The stream-of-consciousness exercise was draining because I overthink everything, and my internal monologues are a lot!  That kind of self-reflection makes me feel a bit overwhelmed and I value quiet alone time. I don’t feel energized in large, loud crowds.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I often just keep quiet instead of directly engaging them. My priority is maintaining harmony, even if it means suppressing my own opinions or perspectives. My feelings often get ignored, which is a bad habit that I would like to break.","I get stressed easily, especially if things don't go as planned. My initial response is probably to ruminate on what went wrong. After the upset though, I usually try to manage my emotions by distracting myself (music!) or focusing on something else I need to do.

Discovering new creative expressions is a big part of my life.","I'm really focused on rowing tryouts right now.  I'm managing my time by studying hard the night before tests, even if it means sacrificing sleep.  I'm also trying to help Kate stay motivated, pushing her in practice to help us both improve. It is challenging to balance academics with such rigorous training, but the reward of doing my best is worth the hard work.","Honestly, large social gatherings drain me.  The constant interaction and noise can be overwhelming.  I much prefer smaller, intimate gatherings with close friends like Emma.  I find energy in one-on-one time with those I care about, rather than large social events.

The constant stimulation and superficial conversations were overwhelming. I realized I prefer smaller gatherings with close friends where I can have meaningful interactions, which allows me to recharge instead of deplete my energy.","In a group project, I disagreed strongly with a teammate's approach.

I used to be much more organized and disciplined, but lately, I find myself procrastinating and feeling overwhelmed by even small tasks. I lack the motivation to put in the effort needed to reach my academic goals.","Being around large groups of people usually energizes me, but lately, even smaller social interactions leave me feeling drained. I think it's because I'm preoccupied with my own internal struggles.  I crave connection but find it difficult to engage fully with others when I'm feeling so lost and uncertain.","Disagreements are tough for me. I tend to avoid conflict, which isn't always the best approach.  I value harmony, but sometimes I need to communicate my needs and feelings more effectively, even if it means causing some discomfort.

My essay shows how I struggle to manage my time effectively, constantly feeling overwhelmed by my coursework and deadlines.  I try to create plans and stick to them, but I always feel like I'm falling behind, even though I try to work hard and avoid procrastination.  The constant pressure and fear of missing something is a big challenge for me, but it also motivates me to get things done.  This pressure also motivates me to make plans so I can be more organized.","I find social interaction to be draining more often than energizing.  Spending hours with my roommate, even though she's my best friend here, can leave me feeling exhausted.

The video game Deus Ex, with its multiple endings and moral complexities, further reflects this openness to exploring different perspectives and possibilities.  Even the contemplation of my own mortality and legacy stems from an attempt to grapple with the bigger existential questions.","I haven't exactly been known for meticulous planning and goal setting. My essay shows a tendency toward introspection and philosophical pondering, rather than a structured approach to life goals.

Initially, I felt overwhelmed and homesick, but I’ve coped by talking to my family every day and spending lots of time with Paul.  Focusing on the positive aspects of college and my future makes the transition much easier.",n,y,y,n,y
1743,"I enjoy exploring new ideas, even if they initially seem unconventional or pointless.  For example, this assignment, while seemingly arbitrary, pushed me to consider different perspectives on the purpose of such exercises.  I found the experience of writing this rather insightful, even if the initial thought process was resistant. The resulting reflection on my own internal processes felt oddly rewarding.","While I don't always approach tasks with meticulous planning, I generally manage to meet deadlines. Setting aside large blocks of time to work on certain assignments is how I work best.  I value efficiency, though I don't necessarily excel at rigid time management strategies.  The challenging part is maintaining motivation when a task feels pointless. The rewarding aspect lies in completing it and moving on, in the sense of accomplishment that I have completed another task.","Energetic social interactions, like engaging in lively debates or collaborative projects, are stimulating. However, large or overly demanding social events can leave me drained.  I prefer deeper connections with a smaller group of people rather than superficial interactions with many. This understanding of my need for quality over quantity guides how I approach social situations.","Disagreements are inevitable, but I tend to avoid direct confrontation.  I prioritize understanding the other person's viewpoint, even if I don't agree with it. Instead of aggressively asserting my own opinion, I try to find common ground or simply agree to disagree, prioritizing a peaceful resolution above winning the argument.","Stress and anxiety manifest as overthinking and self-doubt. My initial response to stressful situations is often to withdraw and analyze the problem from all different angles.  To manage this, I use strategies like writing, or focusing my mind on some arbitrary but interesting task, to distract myself and regain perspective, allowing me to address the issue more constructively.",y,y,y,n,n
1744,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I prefer the familiar comfort of things I already know and enjoy.  Going to the mall is my routine way to relax and unwind – it's predictable and satisfying.  I'm not one for trying new foods or activities; I stick to what I like, like Chinese food and my usual shopping haunts.","I'm quite organized when it comes to my shopping trips. I plan what I need – new clothes for fall and a microwave – and stick to my list as much as possible.  The challenge is managing my budget; I get tempted by things I don't necessarily need, which I try to consciously avoid.   Sticking to a budget and avoiding overspending is really important to me, though it can be difficult.","Large social gatherings drain my energy. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings or even spending time alone. The mall, for me, is a solo activity that helps me relax and recharge, not a place for social interaction.  I find big crowds overwhelming, and I tend to avoid situations that require extensive social engagement.","I generally avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll likely keep my opinion to myself unless it directly impacts me. My priority is maintaining peace and avoiding any confrontation.  I'm not assertive in expressing my disagreements, prioritizing harmony over expressing my own views.","Shopping is my way of coping with stress. When I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed, going to the mall and buying things helps me to relax and feel better.  It's a way to distract myself from negative thoughts and regulate my emotions, however it isn't a long term solution. I do recognize this, but its effective in the short term for managing difficult feelings.",n,y,n,n,y
1745,"This past summer, I decided to take a pottery class.  I'd always been creatively inclined but never explored this medium. The motivation was simple curiosity—I wanted to learn a new skill and express myself in a different way.  The experience was incredibly rewarding; I loved the feeling of creating something tangible with my own hands, and I found the process very calming.","One goal I set for myself was to maintain a consistent study schedule throughout my first semester of college.  To stay on track, I created a detailed planner, allocating specific times for classes, studying, and other activities. I prioritized tasks based on deadlines and importance, and used techniques like the Pomodoro method to improve focus. The most challenging aspect was balancing social activities with academic responsibilities, but the reward was a good feeling from my organizational skill and feeling prepared for my coursework.","A memorable social experience was my first college orientation.  While I met some interesting people, the sheer volume of interactions was slightly draining and resulted in feelings of being overwhelmed and needing some quiet time to recharge. It helped me realize that I value meaningful connections over large, superficial social gatherings.","A disagreement I had was with my ex-boyfriend about the effort he was putting into our relationship.  I chose to communicate my concerns directly and honestly, emphasizing that I valued his presence in my life but felt he needed to make the effort to be a good partner. Ultimately, prioritizing open communication and my own well-being led to us parting ways but in a respectful manner.","Starting college significantly increased my stress levels because of the many changes it brought.  My initial reaction was to feel anxious and overwhelmed, but I then focused on creating a routine and engaging in activities like exercising and spending time with a few close friends.  These actions, while not taking the stress away entirely, helped me manage it and keep it from being overwhelming.",y,y,y,y,y
1746,"I once decided to try rock climbing.  I was motivated by a desire to challenge myself physically and mentally, something outside my usual routine.  While initially terrified, the feeling of accomplishment at the top was exhilarating, and the experience fostered a newfound appreciation for pushing my boundaries.","I set a goal to improve my grades in a particularly challenging course. I created a detailed study schedule, breaking down the material into manageable chunks and allocating specific time slots for each.  I used flashcards and practice quizzes to reinforce my learning, and when I fell behind, I adjusted my schedule rather than giving up. The reward was the satisfaction of achieving a good grade, a testament to my dedication and organizational skills.","A memorable social experience was a large party; I felt utterly drained afterward.  The constant noise and stimulation were overwhelming, and I crave solitary time to recharge. This reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate gatherings where I can connect with people on a deeper level rather than superficial interactions.","I once disagreed with a friend about a political issue.  Instead of arguing, I tried to understand their perspective by actively listening and asking clarifying questions.  My priority was preserving our friendship; finding common ground and acknowledging our differing viewpoints was more important than winning the argument.","During a period of intense academic pressure, I felt overwhelmed and anxious. My initial response was procrastination and avoidance.  However, I quickly recognized this wasn't helpful and implemented coping mechanisms, such as exercise and meditation, to manage my stress.  Breaking down tasks and focusing on one thing at a time made the situation more manageable and reduced my anxiety.",y,y,n,y,n
1747,"I wouldn't say I'm exactly a risk-taker.  Most of my experiences are pretty familiar—video games, hanging out with friends, and the usual college stuff. But sometimes, something unexpected will grab my attention, like trying a new marinade for steak.  It's not a huge departure from my routine, but it's a small adventure within my comfort zone. I'd probably feel more comfortable if my mom's kitchen were available, though.","I’m not really known for planning ahead. My schedule is pretty flexible, and I tend to do things on a whim. If a goal comes up, like finishing this essay, I'll usually just work on it until I get it done—with a few breaks, of course, because I tend to get bored easily.  There’s no specific method to my madness. I really wish I had a vacuum, because I'm not very good at keeping my space tidy.","I love being around people I know well.  Being with friends is the best—it energizes me, and we usually do something fun like playing video games or going out.  I'm not sure I'd be comfortable at a big party, though.  If a social interaction becomes overwhelming, I get drained and I need to get back to my place.  I'm happy being around friends but I also need my alone time.","I can be pretty blunt, and sometimes that causes problems. When I disagree with someone, especially Nick, I might tell them what I think directly, even if it's a bit rude.  My priority is getting my point across, and I don't always focus on being nice or understanding their perspective.  I feel like it's important to just say what's on my mind, even if it isn't the most tactful approach.","Stress and anxiety are definite problems for me.  If I get stressed, I tend to get bored and restless, which is often worsened by the loudness of my environment. My response is often to do something else or just try to ignore what's bothering me. It isn't the best coping mechanism, but it works for now. I'd probably handle things better if I had a quieter room and a better way to de-stress, like a cleaner, less cluttered room.",n,n,y,n,y
1748,"Trying something new hasn't been easy for me.  I’ve felt so overwhelmed starting college that exploring new activities or ways of thinking feels impossible. The pressure to succeed academically and the fear of failure make me hesitant to step outside my comfort zone.  I long for the confidence to try something different, but right now, the familiar feels safer.","Honestly, setting and achieving goals has been a major struggle.  My initial plan to thrive in pre-calculus crumbled when I doubted my abilities.  I haven't developed effective time management or resource strategies yet; my focus keeps shifting between anxieties and self-doubt. The overwhelming nature of college makes sustained effort seem insurmountable.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained.  Large social settings at UT are incredibly overwhelming. The sheer number of people makes it hard to connect meaningfully, and trying to keep up feels exhausting. I crave deep, meaningful connections, but building them in such an immense environment feels daunting.  I find solace in my close relationship with Hector.","Disagreements are tough for me.  While I value my relationship with my parents, their overprotective nature causes immense conflict.  I prioritize open communication, but their unwillingness to listen makes resolution impossible.  I often avoid conflict to prevent further frustration and stress, even if it means suppressing my own feelings.","Feeling stressed or anxious is my default state lately.  The transition to college, academic pressures, and self-doubt trigger intense feelings of inadequacy. I tend to isolate myself and overthink, which only intensifies these feelings. I recognize the need to seek help, but actually taking that step feels incredibly daunting.",n,n,n,n,y
1749,"I wouldn't say I'm a particularly adventurous person.  While I enjoy familiar comforts, the thought of trying Vietnamese food again motivates me—it’s a taste of home and happiness.  New experiences aren’t something I actively seek out; I prefer the familiar. The essay reflects this preference for routine and comfort food.","I definitely struggle with staying on track with goals. Procrastination is a major issue for me, as evidenced by my last-minute packing and studying habits. I often wait until the very last moment, and while I acknowledge this flaw, I haven't yet developed effective strategies to overcome it.","Large social gatherings drain me. I much prefer smaller, intimate settings with close friends or my boyfriend.  The essay shows my preference for close relationships. Being around many people feels overwhelming; quiet time is essential for recharging.","I generally try to avoid conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I'll likely keep my opinions to myself unless directly asked, prioritizing maintaining harmony in the relationship. My focus is on keeping the peace, as suggested by my generally agreeable nature and how easily I avoid direct confrontation.","Stress and anxiety manifest as procrastination and a feeling of being overwhelmed.  I tend to avoid dealing directly with stressors, which leads to further anxiety. My desire to return home to my boyfriend and family suggests I seek comfort and emotional support during times of stress.",n,n,n,y,y
1750,"I don't typically seek out radically new experiences.  My sister's note about Nicole Murphy was a surprise, but my actions afterward—approaching her and complimenting her—were driven more by a sudden impulse than a deliberate attempt to expand my horizons. While I felt good in the moment, the whole thing felt a bit unplanned and almost instinctual.","I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven by long-term goals.  This whole Nicole Murphy situation was spontaneous.  I didn't have any structured plan for meeting her; it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.  While I feel good about the outcome, it wasn’t really about following a plan, but rather trusting my gut.","Approaching Nicole energized me, even though the initial interaction was brief. It felt good to express myself and make a connection.  I generally prefer brief interactions over extended ones and I’m comfortable approaching people, which makes such interactions fulfilling. This confirmed to me that I feel best when I trust my own instincts and act upon them, despite any inherent risks involved.","I don’t usually get into big disagreements. The interaction with Nicole was easy; there wasn’t any conflict. My priority was simply expressing myself authentically, and that was easy to do. I wasn't necessarily trying to 'resolve' anything; it was more of a spontaneous expression of my feelings.","The entire experience was nerve-wracking.  My initial reaction was a mix of excitement and anxiety. While I felt a deep sense of anticipation and excitement, I also acknowledge feelings of nervousness. I managed my feelings by taking action; my gut feeling told me to talk to her, so I did. This is typically how I cope with my emotions: by acting on them rather than dwelling on them.",n,n,n,n,y
1751,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a bit unexpected.  For example, last week I decided to try a new restaurant, Kinsolving, even though I usually stick to familiar places. While the food wasn't great, the experience of trying something different sparked some interesting thoughts about travel and beaches. The whole experience left me feeling a bit restless, wanting more adventures.","I'm not the most organized person, and setting goals isn't really my strength. I struggle to stay focused and on track. I think I'm more spontaneous, preferring to let things unfold naturally rather than rigidly planning every step.  The idea of  strict time management fills me with a kind of low-level anxiety. It's easier for me to just go with the flow, even if it means missing deadlines or opportunities.",Social situations are generally draining for me. Large gatherings or loud parties leave me feeling overwhelmed and depleted.  I much prefer quiet time alone or with one or two close friends.  Even small talk can be tiring. I've learned that I need plenty of downtime to recharge after any social interaction.,"Disagreements can be tricky for me. I tend to internalize conflict rather than confront it directly.  My priority is often to maintain peace and harmony, even if it means sacrificing my own needs or opinions. I avoid arguments when possible and try to understand other people’s perspectives. The thought of a direct confrontation causes me a degree of anxiety.","I experience stress and anxiety frequently. My initial response is usually to withdraw and overthink things.  I sometimes find myself caught in cycles of worry and rumination. To cope, I usually try to distract myself with things like music or focusing on simple tasks. I try to find calming activities like taking a walk in nature or listening to calming music.  It's a constant work in progress.",y,n,n,y,y

While frustrating at times, the experience has been surprisingly rewarding;  I find a sense of accomplishment in learning something new and challenging myself.","Getting into business school was a major goal, requiring intense focus and self-discipline throughout high school.  I managed my time by creating detailed schedules, prioritizing my studies, and cutting back on less important activities. While I felt stressed balancing academics and sports, the satisfaction of achieving this goal fuels my determination.  The challenge was maintaining balance and managing the pressure, but the reward was immense.","A recent draining social experience was a networking event for business school. While I generally enjoy meeting people, the superficial interactions and constant pressure to impress left me feeling depleted. I realized that high-energy, large group settings aren’t my ideal social environment; I prefer meaningful, intimate conversations.","A disagreement arose with my girlfriend's mother concerning our relationship.  My priority was communicating my commitment to my girlfriend while respecting her mother's concerns. My approach involved respectful dialogue and showing that our relationship was built on love and sacrifice.  It was difficult, but maintaining an open and understanding conversation was key.","When my parents divorced, I felt intensely anxious and stressed. I initially retreated, struggling to focus on school. Over time, I sought support from my girlfriend and grandmother, focusing on schoolwork as an outlet and a path to success. This coping strategy helped manage my emotions constructively.",y,y,y,y,n
1753,"I'm not sure I've ever intentionally sought out something *completely* new.  I tend to stick to what I know, but I did try a new workout routine recently – lots of intense exercise. It was motivated by a desire to lose weight, and while I'm exhausted, I feel good about making that commitment to myself.","Setting and achieving goals isn't really my strong suit. I'm more spontaneous.  If I set a goal – like getting money from Clint and Dilen – I might get distracted.  I don't really have a system, it's more about remembering things as they come up or reacting when I need something. That approach is more intuitive for me.","Going out with my friends is usually fun and energizing, as long as there aren't a lot of people. The energy of big social gatherings can be overwhelming, though.  If it's a small group of close friends, it’s more relaxing and I can be myself better. I definitely need some alone time to recharge after social events.","Disagreements are tricky. I try to avoid direct confrontation, which can sometimes mean avoiding saying what I actually think.  I prioritize maintaining relationships, even if it means compromising my own feelings or opinions.  It's easier to just go with the flow.","I get anxious a lot. When it happens, I usually get overwhelmed and shut down a little. Sometimes I just want to be alone until it passes. It isn't really productive and I wish I was better at managing it, but I haven't quite figured out how to approach stressful situations in a healthy way yet.",y,n,y,n,y
1754,"I'm constantly exploring new things, even if it's just trying a new recipe like pasta with ragu sauce instead of my usual pot pie.  The motivation often comes from simple curiosity or a sudden craving, like the time I randomly decided to try running on the treadmill even though I usually don't like it. Afterwards, I usually feel pretty satisfied, even if it's just the satisfaction of having explored a different option.","I'm pretty focused on my goals.  For example, I'm working on finishing my psychology notes and getting my laundry done, even though there are a lot of distractions in the computer lab. While I don't have a formal system, I naturally prioritize tasks that seem important to me. It's rewarding to check things off my mental to-do list, but distractions like noisy neighbors or the alluring smell of brownies can occasionally derail me.","Social situations usually drain my energy; the noisy computer lab is a good example. I prefer smaller interactions or time alone to recharge, and even small distractions interrupt my focus.  I crave quiet time to process my thoughts, so large social gatherings are not my preferred way to spend my time.","I generally try to avoid direct conflict, even when I disagree with someone about, say, the lack of paper in the printer. Instead, I’ll just get the paper myself rather than addressing the issue directly. I prioritize my own peace and quiet over directly confronting conflict,  sometimes to the detriment of expressing my needs.","Stress manifests for me as a tendency to get distracted and shift my thoughts rapidly. When I’m stressed, like when I'm in the noisy computer lab without my own computer, my train of thought jumps from topic to topic—from the printer to my fractured thumb, and then to brownies.  I cope by simply focusing on other things, which helps me momentarily forget about my frustrations.",y,y,n,y,n
1755,"I haven't really sought out many new experiences lately.  My focus has been on figuring out my college path, which has involved some internal shifts in thinking, but nothing dramatically different. The whole process of narrowing down my academic choices has felt more like a relief than a grand adventure.  I suppose adding a communications class is somewhat new, but mostly I'm sticking to what feels comfortable and safe.","I'm not the most organized person. Getting through calculus, despite my struggles, required a minimal level of planning - mostly attending class and attempting the homework.  Staying committed to a goal hasn't been easy. I know I need consistency to lose weight, but it's a struggle. It is challenging and frustrating to stay focused on long term goals.  I'd say I prioritize immediate comfort over consistent effort.","Large social gatherings drain me.  Being around too many people just feels overwhelming and annoying.  I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions, or even being alone.  I'm happiest when I can be myself and avoid the social pressures I dislike. That calc class was one such draining experience – feeling inadequate amongst others.  It certainly reinforced my preference for less stimulating social encounters.","Disagreements are uncomfortable.  I tend to avoid conflict, even if I don't agree with someone. My priority is to keep things peaceful, even if it means compromising my own opinions.  I'd rather withdraw or find a way to avoid the discussion altogether, and save my energy.  I'm not confrontational.  Call me a crab.","The stress of calculus class made me feel completely overwhelmed and inadequate.  My initial response was self-doubt and a sense of failure. To manage this, I focused on eliminating one possibility and narrowing my choices in college, which provided a sense of direction and control.  I'm not great at tackling stress head-on.  I prefer to avoid what causes it.",n,n,y,n,n
1756,"I'm not one for drastically changing things up.  Moving to Austin from New Braunfels was a big shift, but it was more of a necessary change than an adventurous pursuit of the unknown. I was excited about the city, but mostly because I was ready for a change of scenery. The experience has been a mix of good and bad — I miss my old friends and familiar places, but I've also adapted better than I expected.","I'm not exactly known for my planning skills.  Goals? Sure, I have them, but keeping to a schedule? That's not really my strong suit. My sleeping schedule is completely irregular and I haven't prioritized going grocery shopping, even though my car is inconveniently located. It takes a major event, like needing to print something, to motivate me to seek out help from others.","Large social gatherings drain me.  Being around thousands of people at a huge university is overwhelming. I much prefer the company of a smaller, more intimate group of friends. The move to Austin has been a challenge, mainly because it’s difficult to transition from classmates to close friends. That's why I miss my close-knit group in New Braunfels.","Conflicts are difficult for me. The fight with my best friend, which spread like wildfire, demonstrates how much I hate conflict. My priority was initially keeping the information confidential. When that was broken, I was hurt and didn't confront my friend immediately.  The encounter with my roommate's holier-than-thou attitude also frustrated me, but I kept my temper in check due to the presence of Elizabeth.","I get stressed easily.  The move, the fight with my best friend, the overwhelming nature of a huge university—it all adds up. My initial response to stress is to retreat, but I try to work through things.  For example, while I find the transition to university life challenging, I'm adapting. Going out with friends to 6th Street is an example of a coping mechanism.",n,n,n,n,n

It was the sheer strangeness and complexity that intrigued me; I wanted to understand something so different from my everyday life. Afterward, I felt a profound sense of intellectual satisfaction, and a renewed appreciation for the vastness of human knowledge.","I set a goal to learn a new programming language, which required consistent effort over several months. To stay on track, I created a detailed study schedule and broke down the learning process into manageable steps. I also used productivity apps to track my progress and stay motivated.  While there were challenging moments of frustration, the sense of accomplishment upon mastering the language was incredibly rewarding.  The consistent effort and structure were key.","A memorable social experience was attending a large-scale conference related to my field of interest. The intense intellectual stimulation and the vibrant exchange of ideas with so many people were incredibly energizing.  The shared passion and collaborative atmosphere created a truly fulfilling experience, reinforcing my preference for engaging and stimulating social interactions.  I thrive in environments where I can connect with others on a deep level, rather than superficial small talk.","I once had a serious disagreement with a close friend about a political issue.  My priority wasn't necessarily to ""win"" the argument, but rather to understand their perspective and find common ground.  We engaged in a respectful dialogue, acknowledging each other's feelings and viewpoints, even though we didn't fully agree.  Maintaining our friendship was more important than proving my point.","I felt intense stress when facing a tight deadline on a critical project. My initial response was anxiety and self-doubt.

Even though I'm thinking about switching majors to screenwriting and playing basketball full-time, I haven't actually pursued it.  That's a big change, but I haven't taken concrete steps yet.  My motivation is pure dissatisfaction – school feels like a waste of time compared to my true passions.  I'm not sure how I'd feel afterward, but the thought of it is exciting.","Honestly, I haven't had much success with long-term goals. I struggle to stay organized and manage my time. My schoolwork often falls by the wayside because I'd rather be playing basketball or pursuing my other interests.  I really admire people who can stick to a plan, but that's not me.  I think the most rewarding part is finally getting a task done, even if it’s way overdue.","A memorable social experience that drained me was being stuck in this dorm with my current roommate. He's extremely introverted, and our personalities clash.  The constant quiet and lack of shared interests left me feeling lonely and isolated. This reinforced my preference for people who share my energy level and interests. I crave social interaction but only with the right kind of people.","I've had disagreements with my roommate, but I mostly avoid direct confrontation.  I try to stay in my own space rather than resolve the issue. My priority is to minimize conflict and maintain a sense of peace. That's probably not the most mature approach, but it's how I handle things.","I've been feeling extremely stressed lately, primarily because of school and my roommate. My initial response is usually to withdraw and feel sorry for myself. I haven't found the best coping mechanisms. Sometimes, talking to my sister helps; otherwise, I just try to distract myself, typically with basketball.",y,n,y,n,n
1759,"I'm pretty open to trying new things, especially music. I've always been a big music fan and enjoy listening to all different genres, from rock and rap to classical and country.  I think my eclectic musical taste reflects my personality and willingness to explore diverse experiences. While I haven't tried anything drastically different lately, the diversity of my musical preferences reflects an openness to new ideas and experiences.","I know I sometimes procrastinate, like with my homework and that Warcraft game, but I always end up finishing what I start. That’s a quality I value in myself. Getting a job to help my parents financially is a long-term goal that requires careful planning and time management. While I haven’t laid out a detailed plan yet, the fact that I recognize the need to balance work and school indicates a degree of planning and prioritization.","I enjoy having noise around me, I don’t like silence.  A draining social experience would be forced small talk in a quiet room.  I really prefer having music playing or people talking to me, which is why I'm comfortable around my friends and family.  Being around people energizes me and contributes to my overall happiness. The silence in my dorm room, where I play games, seems to fuel this preference for activity and interaction.","I consider myself very accepting of others' tastes, and am comfortable with people having preferences that differ from mine. I don't actively seek out conflict, but I'm willing to understand others perspectives even if I don't fully agree. My preference for diversity in music shows this in action – I enjoy all types of music, valuing the diverse viewpoints and emotions that different artists convey.","While I feel overwhelmed by college and family concerns, I'm pretty good at managing my stress and avoiding excessive worry.  The 9/11 anniversary, for example, brought up strong emotions, but instead of succumbing to anxiety, I chose a constructive response by donating blood.  This reflects my ability to channel my feelings into positive action and maintain a generally balanced emotional state.",y,n,n,y,n

I use a planner and break down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. Even when I’m overwhelmed, I remind myself of my long-term goal, which keeps me motivated. It's challenging to balance everything, but the sense of accomplishment is rewarding.","A recent night out with close friends was incredibly energizing.  We laughed, shared stories, and genuinely connected.  The positive energy fueled me for days. Conversely, attending a large, impersonal gathering can leave me feeling drained and needing solitude to recharge.","I had a disagreement with my roommate about cleanliness, and it was frustrating. I tried to approach the situation calmly, explaining my concerns without blaming her. My priority was maintaining a functional living space while respecting her feelings, although I admit, some compromises were hard.","When I get sick, my anxiety can spiral.

I generally prefer the familiar and comfortable.","I'm pretty good at setting and achieving goals, especially when it comes to things I care about, like my relationship and my classes.  For example, I'm determined to get my boyfriend a birthday gift and I'm working consistently on my writing assignment despite initial struggles. When challenges arise, like finding suitable material for my assignment, I persevere and find a way to manage my time effectively to get everything done. I find the process of achieving something rewarding.","Spending time with my boyfriend is energizing;  his presence makes me happy.  However, large social gatherings tend to drain me. I generally prefer intimate interactions with people I know well, rather than large, busy events. The feeling of closeness and connection I have with my loved ones is what truly fulfills me socially.","I try to be understanding and agreeable, even when confronted with disagreements. For instance, the issue of the unlocked bathroom door shows how even if I have strong feelings, I won't necessarily directly confront those who disagree with me. My priority is to maintain positive relationships, and I'll usually try to find a compromise rather than escalate conflict.","I usually don't feel stressed, but the essay writing process did create some anxiety.

My initial motivation was probably societal pressure, but I'm clearly not enjoying the process.","I struggle with long-term goals, as evidenced by my procrastination on my job application and homework.  My essay reveals a lack of structured time management; I'm easily distracted and my thoughts jump from one thing to another.  Staying committed is a major issue for me; I'm easily swayed by immediate desires (like thinking about my boyfriend instead of my work).  The thought of the challenges associated with goals likely overwhelms me.","Social interactions usually leave me feeling drained rather than energized, as my essay suggests I primarily focus on my boyfriend and feel overwhelmed by the prospect of making new friends. I find the need to constantly initiate and maintain social connections exhausting.  This essay reinforces my need for alone time and my discomfort with large social gatherings. My preference is for smaller, intimate settings with close friends, which I lack currently in my college experience.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  In the essay, you don't see me expressing conflict, mostly because I'm preoccupied with my own anxieties and feelings. I'm not assertive in addressing conflicts directly. My primary concern is my comfort and emotional well-being, often prioritising avoiding conflict over addressing the core issue, leaving conflict largely unresolved.","Stress and anxiety are recurring themes in my writing; my essay highlights a range of anxieties:  academic pressures, loneliness, and relationship concerns. My initial response to stress is often to withdraw and focus on my negative feelings, as exemplified by my dwelling on my discomfort. I attempt to cope through distraction (thinking of my boyfriend, wanting a shower), but don't seem to have effective strategies for managing my emotions constructively.",y,n,n,n,y
1763,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try something completely new lately.  My life has been pretty focused on managing my health, school, and work.  The biggest ""new"" thing recently was getting the MRI results back – that was certainly a new experience, filled with anxiety and relief.  The motivation was, of course, my health, and the relief afterward was immense.","Juggling school, work, and my health has been a major goal requiring sustained effort. I prioritize tasks based on deadlines, using to-do lists and calendars.  Evenings are usually dedicated to homework, but sometimes work schedules impact this plan.  Staying committed has been challenging; fatigue from long days and headaches often make it difficult, but I try my best to power through.  It's rewarding to see progress in my studies despite the obstacles.","Most social experiences lately have been draining.  My part-time job as a server involves constant interaction, leaving me exhausted afterward.   Even time with friends is limited due to my schedule and distance from campus.  This has reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate interactions rather than large social gatherings.  I value my quiet time greatly.","The breakup with my boyfriend was a major disagreement. I prioritized my own needs for independence and space, although it was difficult.  I tried to communicate my feelings honestly and respectfully, though it still caused heartache.  The resolution wasn't perfect, but I feel like I needed to prioritize my own well-being and personal growth.","The constant headaches and the uncertainty surrounding my tumor diagnosis caused immense stress and anxiety. Initially, I felt overwhelmed and anxious.  To manage my emotions, I focused on following my doctor's advice, taking my medication and getting the MRI.  Trying to compartmentalize and focus on tasks one at a time has helped me cope with these overwhelming feelings.",n,y,n,y,y
1764,"Changing my major from computer science to nursing was a huge leap for me.  It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision; I'd been considering it for a while, realizing my passion lies in working with children. The desire to make a difference in kids' lives, combined with the practicality of a shorter education path than becoming a doctor, ultimately motivated me.  While initially daunting, I feel excited about this new direction.","Getting good grades in school is a significant goal of mine, especially since my parents invest so much in my education.  I managed my time last year by maintaining a consistent study schedule, but I wish I'd been more proactive in seeking out extra help when needed.  While I haven't always been perfect, the pride I feel in my academic achievements, and the desire to make my parents proud, are powerful motivators that keep me going.  The challenging part is balancing my studies with my social life and the overwhelming feelings of loneliness.  However, the rewarding aspect is the sense of accomplishment I experience after every successful semester.","Talking to my friends back in San Antonio energizes me because it provides much-needed connection and reminds me of my support system.  Being in a new city has been isolating, and I crave that same closeness and comfort here in Austin. On the other hand, my interactions with my roommate have left me feeling drained and confused. This experience highlights my need for close relationships and the difficulty I have connecting with strangers. I find myself wanting to reach out more, but shyness prevents me.","My disagreement with my mom over my major choice is challenging. I'm trying to find a balance between respecting her opinion and asserting my independence.  My priority is to communicate my feelings and perspective calmly, ensuring she understands my reasoning and passion for nursing, although doing so feels incredibly difficult. I hope we can reach a mutual understanding despite our differing opinions.","Moving to Austin and the resulting loneliness have been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing for me. My initial response was to withdraw and call my friends and family for comfort.  To cope, I'm trying to actively engage in activities that help me meet new people like joining a sorority and also using my phone to stay connected to friends and family.  While anxiety remains, these small steps are helping me work through my feelings.",y,y,y,y,n
1765,"I love trying new things, although I can get really caught up in the details of planning my outfits for the week.  The thought of wearing my new pink shirt and skirt together excites me – it's a new combination, a new look.  Thinking about all the outfit possibilities keeps my mind busy.","I'm not the most organized person.  While I have a general idea of what I want to wear each day,  my plans are fluid and depend heavily on the weather and who I might be spending time with.  I prioritize having fun over strict scheduling.  The challenge is keeping up with all the social plans I make.","Going clubbing back home is a social experience that really energized me. I am looking forward to going to clubs once I turn 18. The thought of dancing and meeting new people is really exciting and motivates me to make plans for my birthday. It's a stark contrast to the ""losers"" parties that I am currently forced to attend.  Being with my close friends is fulfilling.","I haven't really shown much conflict in my essay. I seem to easily adapt to the various plans for my birthday, even if they involve many different people. I am quite open to the suggestions of others, even if it means adjusting my initial plans.",I don't seem to express any anxiety or stress in this writing sample. I am mainly excited and enthusiastic about my upcoming birthday and the social events planned around it.  My focus is on fun and excitement.,y,n,n,y,n
1766,"I haven't done anything drastically new recently, but I've been trying to expand my musical tastes.  I'm usually drawn to calming, peaceful music that helps me relax, but I've been actively seeking out different genres.  It's a small step, but it feels like a way to broaden my perspective and potentially find new ways to manage stress.","I recently set a goal to complete a large assignment—this homework.  I managed my time by scheduling a specific block for it, knowing this is the only time I have available.  Staying committed was challenging due to my low mood, but I prioritized the task to minimize future stress. The reward is the sense of accomplishment in completing a task and reducing anxiety about deadlines.","Listening to music while working is my favorite social thing to do, it keeps me energized. I find it very fulfilling because it helps me stay positive and feel better, despite my current mood. This reinforces that I prefer solo activities, but music can act as social interaction for me.","I haven't had any major disagreements recently. I tend to avoid conflict, focusing on my own well-being and managing my emotions first.  If faced with a disagreement, I'd try to listen and understand the other person's perspective before stating my opinion, but avoiding confrontation is my priority.","I've been feeling quite down lately, which is affecting my mood and impacting my concentration.  My initial response was to avoid the feelings, focusing on homework as a distraction. To manage my emotions, I listened to music, which helped calm me down and get my focus back.  I realized this approach is an effective way to constructively cope with my stress.",y,y,y,y,n
1767,"I haven't really tried anything completely new since moving to Austin.  Everything feels overwhelming and unfamiliar, making me cling to the familiar comfort of my longtime friends from home.  The thought of venturing outside of that comfort zone feels too daunting right now.",I haven't really set any long-term goals since starting college.  My focus is just on getting through each day and maintaining my friendships with the people from back home.  The pressure of being so far from home and dealing with anxieties about school and relationships means I'm not prioritizing long-term planning.,"Being surrounded by so many unfamiliar faces in a huge city leaves me feeling drained.  I crave the comfort of my close-knit group of friends from San Benito.  Large social gatherings are anxiety-inducing, and I find more fulfillment in close, intimate relationships with people I already know well.","I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  With my roommate, Diana, I'm fortunate to have a close relationship where we can discuss things openly without creating tension. But when disagreements arise, I prioritize maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation.","Moving to Austin has been incredibly stressful. The feeling of being so far from home, the anxiety of being in a large class with strangers, and boy problems have contributed to a sense of unease. I cope by spending time with my close friends, seeking their reassurance and support.",n,n,y,y,y
1768,"I've always been fascinated by animals, which led me to get a weenie dog.  It was completely unexpected, as I'm not typically a ""dog person,"" but the experience has been surprisingly fulfilling and has opened my eyes to a different perspective on pet ownership and emotional support.  I find poetry and creative expression to be a fulfilling outlet for my imagination and a way to find beauty in the ordinary, further showing my openness to new ideas and experiences.","I don't really adhere to structured goal-setting.  I tend to be more impulsive and reactive to my emotions, which leads to inconsistent productivity. The focus shifts quickly.  While I might start a project with great enthusiasm, my attention span wanes if it becomes difficult or tedious. I'm more likely to abandon things than persist through challenges.","Large social gatherings tend to leave me drained. I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Being around too many people can feel overwhelming and exhausting.  It causes a sensory overload. I recognize this about myself, but I do enjoy quiet, comfortable moments with people I trust.","I'm not very good at handling conflict directly.  Disagreements often lead to inner turmoil rather than open confrontation.  I'll likely avoid the situation entirely, or process my feelings privately rather than engaging in debate or trying to find a compromise. This is due to prioritizing my emotional wellbeing over conflict resolution.","Stress and anxiety are common for me.  My initial response is usually to isolate and overthink the situation. However, I also look to things that comfort me, like my dog. My thoughts easily spiral into a negative direction and my anxiety can intensify, and I don't have many tools in my arsenal to bring myself back to center or a more balanced place mentally.",y,n,n,n,y
1769,"I don't really seek out new experiences; I'm pretty content with my routine.  College itself was a new environment, but that felt more like an obligation than a choice.  I haven't actively sought out new ways of thinking or activities outside of my usual interests. The thought of trying something completely new actually makes me a little anxious.","My goal is to succeed in college, but my approach is far from organized.  I struggle with time management and often find myself falling behind.  I know I *should* create a study schedule, but I haven't been successful in sticking to one.  The challenge is my lack of discipline; the reward would be the satisfaction of academic achievement, but I haven't really experienced that yet.","Being around a lot of people drains my energy.  The few social interactions I’ve had at college have been more tiring than fulfilling. I find quiet time alone much more restorative. I prefer small groups or one-on-one interactions, and large gatherings make me anxious and overwhelmed.","I tend to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to be polite and avoid confrontation, even if that means not fully expressing my own opinion.  Keeping the peace is more important to me than winning an argument. This might stem from a desire to maintain harmony and avoid upsetting anyone.","I get stressed and anxious easily, particularly when I'm overwhelmed with schoolwork or feeling unsure about my performance. My initial response is often to withdraw and worry, but I try to manage this by taking breaks and reminding myself of my goals.  Although, ""constructively"" managing my emotions is something I struggle with.",n,n,n,y,y
1770,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  While I enjoy learning about history, particularly ancient Rome,  I mostly stick to familiar activities and subjects. Trying something completely new isn't a high priority for me; I prefer the comfort of what I already know and understand.  The Iliad, for instance, is proving to be more of a chore than a new experience I'm eager to embrace.","I'm not the most organized person.  Juggling multiple classes, a girlfriend, and the Iliad is proving challenging. I don't have a formal system for managing my time or resources. My approach tends to be more reactive than proactive. I prioritize what feels urgent in the moment, often leading to last-minute cramming and a general feeling of being overwhelmed.","I find large social gatherings draining.  I prefer smaller interactions with close friends like my girlfriend, Lauren, and a few people from my psychology class. I feel energized by one-on-one conversations or smaller group settings where I can engage in meaningful discussions. Larger groups leave me feeling overwhelmed and needing time alone to recharge.","I try my best to avoid conflict. I'd rather go along with people than cause a disagreement. If a conflict does arise, I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony and understanding. I’ll often just let things go rather than engage in a lengthy dispute, even if I disagree internally. This approach reflects my preference for peace and quiet.","I'm not easily stressed.  While I may feel overwhelmed by academic pressures (like reading the Iliad!), my emotional responses tend to be fairly subdued.  I deal with stress by focusing on my coursework or enjoying downtime with my girlfriend. I don't tend to dwell on negative feelings.",n,n,n,y,n

Initially, I was terrified I'd fail and have to drop the class, but I stuck with it, and now I'm finding it manageable, even though the homework is tedious. It was definitely a challenge, but I'm glad I persevered.","Getting good grades is a big goal for me, especially in economics. I'm studying a lot to get at least a B, and I'm carefully scheduling my time to fit in studying for my upcoming tests and working on my English paper.  This semester is definitely a test of my time management skills!  The challenge is balancing my social life and studies, but the reward will be good grades.","Going to the Phi Psi mixer tonight is something I look forward to. Social events like that definitely energize me; it's a break from studying, and I enjoy interacting with people.  Spending time with Ryan is also energizing, despite our busy schedules. On the other hand, being constantly busy sometimes makes me feel drained.","I don't think I've had any major disagreements lately, but if I do, my priority is understanding the other person's perspective. I try to handle things calmly and rationally.  It's important to find a resolution without making anyone feel bad.","I get really stressed about tests, especially my upcoming economics and other exams. My initial response is anxiety and worry, but I try to manage it by focusing on studying and creating a study schedule.  Knowing I've done my best helps me cope with the stress.  The lack of time for my usual workouts is another source of stress.",n,y,y,y,y
1772,"I don't really seek out new experiences unless they involve music or a really exciting social event, like a concert.  I enjoy familiar things and the comfort of routine, but I’m not against trying something if a friend suggests it, especially if it involves my favorite bands.  Green Day's summer concert was amazing; that's probably the most ""out there"" thing I've done recently.","I'm not the most organized person.  Meeting deadlines mostly depends on how interesting the assignment is or if there's some kind of reward involved, like getting credit for this essay.  I tend to procrastinate unless something really motivates me, like a fun event or the need to impress a friend.  I don't plan too much in advance.","Going to a concert like the Green Day show is energizing.  Being around people who share my enthusiasm for music is fulfilling and fun.  It recharges me. I enjoy being with friends, especially when it's spontaneous and involves something exciting. I do, however, find constantly socializing draining. I need downtime.","I try to avoid conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'll usually just keep my opinion to myself unless it's something I feel really strongly about, like my dislike for the Oklahoma Sooners. Even then, I'll mostly just complain to my friends rather than confront the person directly.  Maintaining friendly relationships is important to me.","I don't usually get overly stressed.  If I am, I'll distract myself by listening to music or hanging out with friends, or perhaps even spending time with my girlfriend.  The thought of a challenging situation makes me anxious but overall, I’m fairly relaxed.",n,n,y,y,n

New experiences tend to make me a bit anxious, so sticking to what I know feels more comfortable.",I'm pretty organized and plan ahead. I always make sure I leave early enough to avoid being late to important events like my brother’s pep rally. My goal this semester is to balance my social life and academics. This involves creating a schedule and prioritizing assignments to ensure I have time for both.,"Large, boisterous gatherings drain me.  I much prefer smaller gatherings with close friends, like my time with my roommates or my boyfriend.  Being around lots of people I don't know makes me feel overwhelmed and exhausted.  I recharge best in quiet, familiar settings, like my family’s home.","I try to avoid conflict, and generally agree with others to keep the peace.  While I have my opinions and preferences, expressing dissent directly makes me uncomfortable.  I prioritize maintaining positive relationships over voicing disagreement, which sometimes means setting aside my own perspective.","I don't generally experience intense stress or anxiety. I am generally calm, even though many people may ask ""what is wrong with me?""  However, larger social events sometimes cause me a little anxiety, but I manage this by having a plan and sticking to my routine, which helps me feel more in control and less overwhelmed.",n,y,n,y,n
1774,"I'm always up for trying new things, even if it's a little scary.  For instance, I signed up for this experiment in my Communications Studies class, even though I had no idea where the room was located and it all felt a bit overwhelming at first.  I figured it would be a good learning experience, and it's in line with my interest in communications.  I'm generally curious about new experiences and approaches.","I definitely struggle with consistently following through on long-term goals.  I have this goal of finishing my textbook readings in all my classes, but I keep getting sidetracked.  I often forget deadlines and tasks. Organizing my time and resources isn't my strength.  I really appreciate the structure of my classes but I often find myself doing things last minute which often causes a lot of stress.","Social situations can be both exhilarating and exhausting for me.  I enjoy spending time with close friends; going to see my friends back home is something I always look forward to, but sometimes larger social gatherings can leave me feeling drained. It depends entirely on the context of the interaction. I value my close relationships and need some time to myself to recharge. I think I'm pretty introverted.","Disagreements are tricky. My roommate Katie and I often clash because she isn't always considerate of my feelings.  I tend to prioritize open communication, even if it means voicing my frustrations.  However, sometimes I get caught up on conflict and it becomes stressful, as I value my relationships and worry about upsetting people. I sometimes delay addressing problems until I have a moment of clarity.","I get stressed and anxious easily. The other day, I felt a huge wave of nervousness when I had some trouble figuring out the location of this class experiment, a feeling that lingered on even after I completed the task.

1775,"I've always been drawn to classical music; it provides a sense of calm and focus.  Recently, I decided to explore other genres, like alternative and jazz, to see how different musical styles affected my mood and concentration.  While I still prefer classical music, the experiment expanded my musical horizons and helped me understand how external stimuli influence my emotional state.","I'm currently working on improving my self-esteem, which is a long-term goal. I haven't devised a formal plan, but I'm trying to be more self-aware of my negative thoughts and challenge them.  This is challenging because it requires confronting my insecurities, but rewarding in that I'm beginning to notice small improvements in how I view myself.","Social situations often leave me feeling drained.  I recently attended a large class, and the sheer number of people and potential for interaction left me feeling anxious and overwhelmed. This experience reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate settings, and highlighted my need for alone time to recharge.","I often avoid conflict. I had a disagreement with my roommate about noise levels. I tried to communicate my needs calmly, but ultimately prioritized maintaining a peaceful living environment over asserting my preferences strongly. This demonstrates my tendency to prioritize harmony over direct confrontation.","I often experience anxiety, especially in new or unfamiliar situations.  For example, arriving late to class today caused considerable stress and self-doubt. To manage this, I tried to focus on what I could control: getting to class as quickly as possible, rather than dwelling on potential negative consequences.  Finding ways to self-soothe, like listening to music, is important for me.",y,y,n,n,y
1776,"I haven't really had the opportunity to try anything drastically new recently.  My life feels pretty structured right now,  focused on making big decisions like whether or not to join a sorority.  That in itself feels a little daunting, but it's not quite the same as exploring a new hobby or travel destination. I'm more focused on navigating the social aspects of college life at the moment.","The decision about the sorority is definitely requiring sustained effort, even if it’s mostly mental. I’m trying to weigh all the pros and cons, gather opinions, and consider the time commitment.  It’s challenging because I’m torn; part of me wants to avoid the risk of rejection, but another part knows I'll regret it if I don't try.  I'm trying to systematically collect information to help me decide.  So far, organization is proving more difficult than I thought.","Honestly, most social experiences lately have been a bit draining.  Even being around my friends at the mall felt somewhat pointless,  and the constant need to navigate social situations and interactions leaves me feeling tired. I think I crave more alone time and fewer forced social engagements. This makes me question whether a sorority, with its constant social events, would truly fit my needs.","I've had some disagreements with people about the sorority, mainly because some have strong opinions against it. My priority is to understand their concerns; I don't want to dismiss their perspective, even if I don't entirely agree.  I value respectful conversation, even if it prolongs my decision making process. To be honest, the whole thing has made me more hesitant than before.","The uncertainty surrounding the sorority decision and the stress of college life in general have made me quite anxious.  Initially, I avoid making a choice, but I'm trying to actively seek information to help me approach the situation more constructively.  This process is helping me deal with the stress, although it's still a somewhat overwhelming experience.",n,y,n,y,y
1777,"I haven't really tried anything drastically new lately.  I'm more focused on navigating my new life at UT and making friends.  I suppose starting university itself was a big change, but it hasn't felt like a conscious choice to try something new so much as a necessary transition. I feel overwhelmed rather than excited by the experience, to be honest.","I’m really not a very organized person. This assignment is a prime example – I procrastinated massively! I don't really have any effective time-management strategies, I just kind of let things happen.  The rewarding part is finally getting things done, even if it’s stressful, but the challenge is constant procrastination and the resulting stress.","Meeting new people is energizing for me, but it's also pretty anxiety-inducing.  Being in a huge university like UT can be intimidating, and I often feel unnoticed.  However, when I do meet someone interesting, like that guy I mentioned, it gives me a real boost.  I crave connection and having people to hang out with to avoid feeling alone.","I haven't had any major disagreements lately, but my relationship is kind of…complicated.  We're not officially broken up, but it's not really working. I find myself avoiding conflict, mostly because it feels overwhelming, but it’s not really healthy. I prioritize maintaining a relationship, even if it's dysfunctional.","I've been incredibly stressed and anxious lately – the breakup, starting university, feeling lonely, and generally being overwhelmed have really taken a toll.

Recently, I started listening to a new Dave Matthews Band album, and although initially, I found some of the songs a bit unusual, I kept listening.

This willingness to explore different musical styles reflects my openness to new experiences and my desire to expand my tastes.","I aim to work out regularly, but my current Navy schedule hasn't facilitated this goal as much as I'd like. I intend to create a more structured workout plan to compensate for the reduced physical training opportunities. I struggle with consistency, but I believe that a structured approach will enable me to overcome this challenge and reach my fitness goals.","Going to Dave Matthews Band concerts always energizes me.  The music, the atmosphere, and the shared experience with other fans create a stimulating and positive social interaction that leaves me feeling uplifted and happy. It reinforces my preference for social events that provide strong emotional connection and shared interests.","My roommate and I have different preferences in snacks (she likes bean dip, I prefer French onion dip). However, we respect each other's choices. I find the easiest way to deal with our differences is to simply accept them rather than trying to impose my preference. This reflects my tendency to prioritize peaceful co-existence over arguing about minor preferences.","Waking up early and feeling tired all day stresses me.  I initially felt irritable, but I try to address this by acknowledging my fatigue and focusing on things I enjoy like music. Sometimes I need to address stress by finding enjoyable activities, rather than pushing through it, especially when dealing with chronic fatigue.",y,y,y,y,n

It was just a distraction from boredom.","I have a lot of things on my to-do list: homework, cleaning my room, working out, and so on.  My time management is… inconsistent.  I tend to procrastinate until I'm almost out of time. I’m aware this isn't ideal,  but I struggle with staying focused on long-term goals and often get sidetracked by immediate desires or distractions.  I find the lack of sustained effort quite challenging, and there's rarely much reward because I leave things until the last minute.","I enjoy going out with my brother and meeting friends, as evidenced by my plans to do so in the essay. Social interactions can be energizing, especially when I'm in the company of close friends, but I also have a need for downtime and solitude.  Spending too much time socializing can be draining; the boredom mentioned in the essay stems from a lack of stimulating activity, rather than social exhaustion per se.","I’m not always the easiest to get along with. My roommate is studying while I'm bored and restless.  My initial reaction is to bother him but I don’t.

I'm not known for my patience or tolerance of inconveniences.","I get bored easily, and that boredom often turns into frustration and anger, as seen in the essay.

Time management isn't a strength of mine; I get easily distracted and procrastinate.  The pressure to finish something feels immense and ultimately paralyzing.,"Social interactions drain me.  Large gatherings or even casual conversations leave me feeling exhausted.  The energy of others is overwhelming, and I long for quiet time to recharge. I value my close relationships, but they require significant energy, and I need to maintain boundaries to maintain energy.","Disagreements are difficult.

It was mostly driven by a desire to advance my career goals (Child Development/Pre-Med) and I feel a mix of exhilaration and exhaustion from the experience, but mostly proud of myself for taking it on.","Juggling school, work, and the kittens has definitely tested my organizational skills!  I use planners, to-do lists, and set alarms to manage my time, prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and importance.  Staying committed has been tough, particularly when unexpected things come up (like kitten emergencies!), but I rely on small rewards and the long-term goal to keep me going.  The challenge is the constant pressure; the reward is the sense of accomplishment.","Last weekend's dinner with my boyfriend at the five-star restaurant was incredibly energizing. The ambiance, the food, and the shared experience with someone I love created a very positive and memorable social interaction.  I thrive in intimate settings where I feel comfortable and connected with others rather than large, overwhelming groups.  This reaffirmed my preference for quality interactions over quantity.","My roommates and I have differing views on my current workload.  They think I'm overextending myself, while I view it as a personal challenge. I try to listen to their concerns, explain my perspective, and compromise where possible. My priority is to maintain our relationship while also pursuing my goals – although their concerns do make me pause and consider my priorities, but overall I believe it is my life and my choices.","My mom's recent cancer diagnosis has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was worry and fear, but I've tried to manage my emotions by focusing on what I can control: being supportive and keeping a positive outlook for both of us.  I've been utilizing good sleep habits, and seeking reassurance from loved ones and medical professionals.",n,y,y,y,y
1784,"I haven't really sought out many brand-new experiences lately.  My focus has been on achieving my goals, which feel more important right now.  While I enjoyed modeling, it wasn't something I actively pursued beyond what was presented to me.  I'm more driven by the familiar and comfortable right now.","Graduating a year early from high school was a major goal that demanded a lot of self-discipline. I prioritized my studies, maintaining a rigorous schedule, and often sacrificing social activities to stay on track.  The challenge was balancing my academic workload with managing the intense emotional upheaval in my family life, but the reward was the sense of accomplishment and the opportunity to move forward quickly with my plans.","Being surrounded by supportive friends and peers in high school was energizing.  These positive social experiences helped shape my understanding of the importance of meaningful connections, and those feelings motivated me to seek out similar relationships in college. However, some interactions can be draining if people are not understanding or supportive.","Disagreements, particularly with my stepfather, are often difficult.  I prioritize expressing my feelings honestly, even if it means conflict, but I also recognize the need to choose my battles. I have been working to find ways to manage these conflicts effectively. My priority is protecting my family, even if it means being outspoken and direct.","The divorce of my parents and the entrance of my stepfather into our family life was incredibly stressful. My initial response was anger and resentment. To cope, I threw myself into my studies, and ultimately graduated early as a means of gaining some independence and control.  Despite my efforts, I still feel the stress of my family situation impacting my current life.",n,y,y,n,n
1785,"I’m not really one for trying new things spontaneously.  I prefer familiar routines and activities. However, I did start watching a new TV show recently, which was outside my usual preferences. It was recommended by a friend, and while I was hesitant at first, I ended up enjoying it. It broadened my horizons a little, though I wouldn't say it changed my life.","I’m not the most organized person. I tend to procrastinate and don't always follow through with plans I make.  I had a goal to finish a semester-long assignment, but I didn't manage my time well and frequently got sidetracked. I usually just do things as they come up.  I didn't particularly enjoy the stress of this. I found that it’s just easier not to plan ahead too much.","I’m generally a pretty introverted person. Large, loud social gatherings really drain me. I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with people I know well. A memorable draining experience was a birthday party with a lot of people I didn't know. It was overwhelming, and I felt relieved when I could finally leave.  This solidified my preference for quiet time alone or with close friends.","I generally try to avoid conflict, and I will often try to accommodate others to keep the peace, especially people I'm close to.   If there is a disagreement, I prioritize understanding the other person's perspective. If it's with someone I care about, I’ll prioritize maintaining the relationship over being ""right.""  The goal is to find common ground.","I don't get stressed out too easily. Things generally don't bother me much; in fact, I find it kind of funny to see how stressed other people get. When I do get stressed, I usually just ignore it, maybe watch TV or something until it passes. I don't engage in avoidance behaviors or overthink things. It passes eventually; why stress about it?",y,n,n,y,n
1786,"I haven't really tried anything *completely* new lately.  My life has been pretty routine, focused on getting back to work after a long break.  The biggest change has been this unemployment – it's been unsettling, but I'm not actively seeking out new experiences.  I'm more focused on stability right now.","I'm not exactly a master of planning. Getting back to work is my current goal, but I haven't had a detailed plan. It's more of a general desire than a carefully charted course.  I guess you could say I'm letting things unfold naturally.  Challenges? Yeah, money worries are a huge one right now.","Spending time with Scott while he was in that brace – that was definitely draining.  Being around someone in pain is tough, and I tend to absorb others' emotions.  I’m energized by smaller social events with close friends; large gatherings drain me. My preference is intimate interactions over large, lively groups.","Disagreements?  I avoid conflict as much as possible. If I disagree, I tend to keep my thoughts to myself, especially if it would cause friction. Prioritizing peace and quiet over open confrontation is important to me.","Being unemployed is stressful!  It makes me feel anxious and insecure about the future.  Initially, I just wallow in it—that's why I'm journaling now.  I know I need to get back to work to relieve the stress, but procrastination is my go-to coping mechanism.",n,n,y,n,y
1787,I don't really seek out new experiences; I tend to stick with what's familiar and comfortable.  The thought of trying something completely new is actually kind of anxiety-inducing.  My essay reflects this preference for the known. I'm more concerned with my immediate relationships and problems than exploring the unknown.,"I struggle with long-term goals. My essay shows a lack of follow-through. For example, my textbooks are gathering dust, and I'm procrastinating on fixing my refrigerator. I start things but often lack the motivation or discipline to see them through, which creates internal conflict.","Social interactions can be both energizing and draining for me, depending on the person and the situation.  While I enjoy being around my boyfriend and others I am close to, even those relationships leave me emotionally exhausted at times. The essay shows how easily I'm affected by others' moods and actions, suggesting that social interaction leaves me feeling overwhelmed.","I usually try to avoid conflict, even when I disagree with someone.  I tend to internalize my feelings rather than confront people directly, as evidenced by my worry about my boyfriend and my ex-best friend.  My priority is maintaining relationships, even at the expense of expressing my own opinions or needs.","I experience significant stress and anxiety, often focused on my relationships. The essay shows this clearly, with recurring themes of worrying about my boyfriend, my friend, and my ability to express my true feelings. This underlying anxiety seems to contribute to my emotional instability and overthinking.",n,n,y,y,y
1788,"I decided to try going to five different stores to find the cheapest printer, even though I hate shopping. My family motivated me, wanting to ensure I got the best deal. While it was frustrating, finding a cheap printer in the first store made the experience ultimately worthwhile. I'm open to new experiences but appreciate efficiency.","Getting my college reading done on time is a major goal. I use to-do lists and try to schedule specific times for reading, but I sometimes struggle to stay on task. College is very different from high school.  I find the independent learning rewarding, but challenging.","Visiting my family over Labor Day weekend was energizing.  Spending time with loved ones always boosts my mood.  Being around people I care about makes me feel fulfilled. I prefer smaller, close-knit social interactions to large, overwhelming ones.","My family’s insistence on visiting five stores to find a cheap printer annoyed me.  I prioritized efficiency and expressed my frustration calmly, though I did feel a bit frustrated by the process.","The adjustment to college life—larger classes and the independence—has been stressful. Initially, I felt overwhelmed.  I’m managing by watching movies to relax and focusing on connecting with my new roommates. I miss my animals and being home.",y,y,y,y,n
1789,"I'm not one for trying new things, especially if they involve a lot of attention on me, like that kickboxing class. I'd rather stick to what I know. The thought of looking stupid is enough to keep me away from anything unfamiliar.  My comfort zone is pretty secure, honestly.","I struggle with long-term goals.  I set intentions, like working out regularly, but my follow-through is inconsistent.  It's more of a sporadic effort rather than a well-structured plan. Procrastination is a major obstacle and so is just feeling overwhelmed with everything else I have to do.","Large social gatherings drain me. I prefer smaller groups of people I feel comfortable around.  I feel more fulfilled spending time with a close friend or two, rather than lots of people at a party. That essay retreat sounds overwhelming.","Disagreements are tough for me.  I tend to avoid direct conflict. I prioritize keeping peace, even if it means not expressing my feelings strongly. I’m more likely to internalize the disagreement than openly address it.","Stress and anxiety manifest in physical symptoms for me. I worry a lot, often dwelling on things. When I'm stressed, I might retreat into myself, and my mood plummets. I don't always have great coping strategies.",n,n,n,n,y
1790,"I was motivated to watch the news coverage of 9/11 intensely in the days and weeks following the attacks, something I had never done before with such sustained focus. It was a completely new level of engagement with current events, driven by a desire to understand the unfolding situation and ensure my safety. Afterward, I felt both a sense of shared national grief and an unexpected sense of pride in the resilience of the American people.  The experience broadened my understanding of the emotional impact of major global events and my place within the larger societal response.","While I don't explicitly describe a goal requiring sustained effort, my essay reveals a lack of structure and planning. My focus on the news coverage and subsequent reflections showcase a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to managing my time.  I didn't set specific goals or employ strategies to achieve them; instead, my actions were largely driven by immediate emotional responses to the events of 9/11.  The challenge was the overwhelming nature of the news, and the reward was a sense of shared experience and national unity.","Watching the news coverage of 9/11 with so much intensity was, in a strange way, a very social experience.  It connected me to a larger community experiencing the same event and emotion.   While I didn’t directly interact with others during this time, the shared experience, mediated through television, was energizing.  It validated my feelings and provided a sense of belonging, strengthening my understanding of the importance of shared experiences for my emotional well-being.","My essay doesn't directly address any disagreements I had with others.  However, my acceptance of the government's actions regarding Iraq suggests a high degree of agreeableness towards authority and national consensus.  My prioritizing the safety and security of the nation implicitly suggests a willingness to agree with dominant viewpoints in a time of crisis.  The avoidance of voicing counter-opinions highlights my preference for harmony and my discomfort with conflict.","The initial response to the events of 9/11 was fear and anxiety.  This is evident in my description of my worries about future attacks and initial hesitation to continue daily life as usual.  My coping mechanisms included turning to religious faith, finding comfort in shared experiences, and focusing on aspects of life that bring joy and comfort.  The act of watching the news, while arguably a manifestation of anxiety, also provided a form of control and predictability amid uncertainty, reducing my overall level of distress.",y,n,y,y,n
1791,"I'm always open to trying new things, even if it makes me a little nervous.  For example, I recently started listening to a wider variety of music using my MP3 player's shuffle function – I've discovered some new artists I really enjoy, and even some I didn't like but still appreciate for different reasons. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, and while some songs were misses, it was generally a positive experience.","I'm not the most organized person. This assignment, for example, felt like a huge challenge; I kept getting distracted and worried about the time. I didn't really have a plan, I mostly just hoped I could get through it and fill the time. I tend to go with the flow instead of rigidly sticking to a schedule. Though the experience was a little stressful, at least I finished it.","Social interactions are something I enjoy, especially with close friends.  Spending time with Ali, for instance, feels energizing;  we can just be ourselves and share random thoughts. I also find that some interactions, such as a call I was expecting, can be a little draining if they cause anxiety or interruptions to what I'm doing at the time. My level of comfort depends on how well I know the person and if it works with my current flow.","I generally try to be agreeable, but that doesn't mean I avoid disagreements. If I disagree with someone, I usually try to understand their point of view first before expressing my own. This was something I tried to do with this assignment in itself. My priority is mutual understanding, even if we don't come to a complete agreement.","I tend to get anxious, especially when facing time constraints or unsure about how to complete a task, which is why I was very focused on the time and how much I'd written.  My initial reaction is often worry, but I try to manage my emotions by focusing on what I *can* control – like completing each sentence of this assignment – and breaking things down into smaller steps to make them less overwhelming.",y,n,y,y,n
1792,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly drawn to radically new experiences.  The essay reflects my excitement over finding a study group for a challenging class – that felt like a breakthrough, but it wasn’t a wildly unconventional activity.  More exciting for me was the spontaneous decision to build a fort with a friend; that was a fun, unexpected detour from my usual routine.","My essay reveals my struggle with time management.  Getting caught up on classes was a huge victory, showing my desire for organization, but it also highlights my inconsistent approach. My strategies involve finding quiet study spaces outside my dorm and utilizing study groups. I'm aware I need improvement, but the sheer relief of catching up indicates the reward outweighs the challenges of organization for me.","The discovery of the study group was incredibly energizing.  Connecting with others who share my academic goals, especially getting help, and making new friends was really uplifting.  The essay shows my extroverted nature;  I thrive in social situations that are supportive and goal-oriented.  Solitary work is difficult, but social interactions, even fleeting ones like the one with Katherine, are enjoyable.","While I haven’t described major conflicts in the essay, my willingness to join a study group and ask for help shows agreeableness.  Even the mention of Coco and Rubes being in the class, while slightly concerning about competition, doesn't express resentment or hostility. My priority is achieving academic success, and I'm willing to collaborate despite possible complexities.","The essay showcases my anxieties about time management and academic performance.  My initial response to these pressures is self-criticism (""I need to learn better time management skills,"" ""It's pretty pathetic""). However, I address my feelings constructively by finding solutions such as creating an optimal study environment and forming supportive study groups; overcoming challenges is a motivation to keep going.",n,y,y,y,n
1793,"I'm not someone who actively seeks out drastically new experiences.  While I appreciate hearing about others' adventures, my comfort zone is pretty well-defined.  However, joining the choir, especially given my sleep-deprived state, was a minor step outside of that.  It was partly motivated by a desire for a creative outlet and a bit of social interaction (though maybe not as much as others might have). I’m still undecided on whether I truly enjoyed it or not; my feelings are mixed.","I struggle with long-term goals.  My essay demonstrates a clear lack of planning and procrastination.  While I *intended* to finish assignments early, I often fail to manage my time effectively, leading to last-minute scrambles.  My attempts to stay committed are minimal and mostly ineffective.  I find the *lack* of effort and consequent poor performance far more challenging than rewarding.  There’s little satisfaction in realizing that I did things only half-heartedly, and this fact makes me more tired than anything.","Social interactions tend to drain me rather than energize me. The choir rehearsal, for example, despite having some friendly interactions, left me feeling quite exhausted. I prefer smaller gatherings or one-on-one time with people I know well.  Large groups or prolonged social events are overwhelming and are something I'm not very good at.  I've come to understand I need significant downtime to recharge after even limited social interactions.","Disagreements are something I try to avoid. My approach is generally to keep quiet and not cause conflict (as evidenced by my lack of action in response to the choir arrangement not being to my liking) even if I disagree with something. Rather than confront directly, I prefer to keep things light and friendly. This is my way of resolving (or more accurately, ignoring) the conflict; I prioritize maintaining harmony even if it means sacrificing my personal opinions.","Stress and anxiety manifest in procrastination and a general lack of motivation, as evident in my writing.  My initial response is often to avoid the stressful situation entirely—by sleeping, for example. To manage my emotions, I usually try to distract myself, often using activities that are comforting like eating or socializing with close friends (when I have the energy.) I don't deal with stress particularly constructively; I often wish I did, but I never take significant action on my own.",y,n,n,n,y
1794,"Starting college was a huge leap into the unknown.  Everything felt different, from the online classes to the social scene.  What motivated me was the desire to grow and learn, even though the uncertainty was nerve-wracking.  Despite the initial anxieties, I'm trying to embrace the new experiences.","I'm trying very hard to keep up with my classes and get good grades.  However, my time management isn't great, and I often feel overwhelmed.  I struggle to stay focused and often find myself procrastinating. My biggest challenge is balancing my desire for good grades with my tendency to get distracted.","Large classes make me feel drained. I find it hard to connect with people unless they reach out first. The impersonal nature of large lecture halls and the pressure to make a good impression leave me feeling exhausted and socially isolated.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings.","I tend to avoid direct conflict.  If I disagree with someone, I usually try to find common ground and keep the conversation calm.  My priority is maintaining a positive relationship, even if it means compromising my own opinions sometimes.","The transition to college has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-provoking.  I often feel overwhelmed by the academic demands and the social pressures.  I respond initially with anxiety and shaking, but I try to manage my feelings by focusing on smaller, achievable tasks.",y,n,y,y,y
1795,"I'm not usually one for trying completely new things; I tend to stick to what I know.  However, starting my own business was a huge leap outside my comfort zone. I was motivated by the desire for financial independence and the potential to prove people wrong who doubted my abilities. Although it was stressful, ultimately, the experience has been rewarding, making me realize my capacity for taking on challenges.","Building my business has been a long-term goal requiring intense effort and time management. I've used various tools to stay organized, like planners and to-do lists, and I've prioritized tasks based on urgency.  Staying committed has been challenging, especially when faced with setbacks, but seeing progress has kept me going. The most rewarding aspect is watching my business grow and succeed.","Energetic social interactions, like those at business training sessions where I network with other entrepreneurs, really fuel me. These connections give me a sense of community and shared purpose. In contrast, draining interactions tend to involve people who are dismissive of my business or my ambitions. It's taught me the importance of surrounding myself with supportive and like-minded individuals.","Disagreements are inevitable, especially when dealing with skeptical friends and family who doubt my business ventures. I try to calmly explain my perspective and understand their concerns, prioritizing open communication and mutual respect. While I’m not always successful in changing their minds, I value the process of finding common ground.","I get stressed easily, especially when facing challenges with my business.  My initial response is often anxiety, but I try to address it by focusing on problem-solving.  Talking to my girlfriend, Daisy, helps me immensely; her support provides the emotional stability I need to navigate difficult situations.",y,y,y,n,n
1796,"I’m not really one for trying new things; I tend to stick to what I know.  I guess the closest I came recently was watching *Will & Grace* again, but even that’s not really new, it's just something familiar and comforting.  I didn't really feel any specific emotion; it was just something to watch.","I'm not particularly good at sticking to long-term goals. I *said* I'd work on my spirits packet, but I'm putting that off until I have to do it. I find prioritizing tasks difficult and often procrastinate, especially if they seem uninteresting or challenging. I’ll probably just end up cramming it all in at the last minute.","Going out with my friends is usually energizing. Even though I haven't really made the effort to make new friends, when I'm with my close friends, it is something I look forward to. It really depends on the group and the context. A large, boisterous gathering would probably drain me though. I'm not fond of big, overwhelming social situations.","When I disagree with someone, I tend to avoid direct confrontation. I value my relationships, and I usually try to find a way to understand their perspective, even if I don't completely agree. I would rather maintain harmony than engage in an argument. My priorities are maintaining the relationship and avoiding conflict.","When I'm stressed, I tend to worry a lot and maybe overthink things.  I'll try to distract myself by watching TV or putting things off. I sometimes have trouble sleeping when I'm stressed.  I don't have any specific strategies, I usually just try to ride it out.",n,n,y,y,n
1797,"I’m not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  Sticking to what I know is usually easier. Although, psychology class has been surprisingly interesting; I didn't expect to find the subject so captivating. It's made me think about things in a different way, but not in a way that pushes my comfort zone too much.","I struggle with staying on task.  Getting homework done feels like a constant uphill battle, and staying organized is not my forte.  Deadlines often loom, and even though I know I should prioritize, I frequently find myself overwhelmed and lacking the self-discipline to push through. The constant pressure to catch up is exhausting.","Being around large groups of people is draining.  I find it much easier to recharge when I'm alone.  Quiet time at home or with my closest friends is when I feel most comfortable and energized, rather than being in large, noisy social gatherings.  Big parties aren't my style.","I usually try to avoid conflict. When disagreements arise, I tend to prioritize maintaining harmony over winning the argument. I'll try to listen to their perspective, even if I don't fully agree. If things get too heated, I might just back down to keep things peaceful.","Feeling stressed is unfortunately a regular occurrence for me lately.  The overwhelming amount of homework, along with the sadness over my uncle’s passing, leaves me feeling anxious and tired. To cope, I usually retreat to my room, trying to relax or distract myself with mindless activities.  It's not a perfect system, but it's what helps me manage for now.",n,n,y,y,n
1798,"I've always been drawn to new experiences.  Moving to Austin for university was a huge leap, completely different from my Chicago upbringing.  While the intense heat was initially jarring,  I found myself embracing the city's vibrant music scene and natural beauty. Discovering new places and activities is a huge motivator for me, and the feeling of exploration and discovery are ultimately rewarding, even if sometimes challenging.","Balancing my studies, social life, and part-time work while in Austin required a degree of organization I hadn’t needed before. I prioritize tasks, create to-do lists, and set realistic deadlines to stay on track. While my roommate’s laziness is a constant source of frustration (and occasionally interferes with my sleep schedule!), the challenges have taught me effective time management skills, and the reward is the sense of accomplishment from managing competing demands.","Large social gatherings often leave me feeling drained.  I prefer smaller, more intimate settings with close friends. The balcony is my favorite spot for conversations with my girlfriend or close buddies. I get energy from meaningful connections, not necessarily large crowds. These experiences have taught me the importance of choosing the right social situations to maintain my energy levels and overall well-being.","My roommate’s behavior is a constant source of conflict. My natural inclination is to try to work things out.  However, his laziness and inconsiderateness have tested my patience. It's a delicate balance between maintaining peace in the apartment and asserting my needs.  I struggle with finding the right way to communicate my frustrations without escalating the conflict.","The heat, the noisy air conditioner, and my roommate all contribute to my stress and anxiety. My initial response is often frustration and irritation. To manage these feelings, I try to find time to relax – usually a quiet evening on my balcony if the air conditioner isn't too loud – and I rely on exercise and talking to friends to help me center myself.",y,y,n,y,y
1799,"I’m not one for radically new experiences, but I did try going to a different campus library once, just to see if it was better than the one I usually go to.  It wasn't dramatically different, but the change of scenery was nice, and I felt a little bit more relaxed than usual while studying. The motivation was mostly curiosity, and afterward, I felt pretty good about stepping outside my usual routine.","Last year, I was a complete mess; I didn’t go to class, partied all the time, and felt awful. This year, I've made a conscious effort to have a routine. It's been challenging at times, especially when other things come up, but getting back into a structured daily schedule has definitely improved my productivity, both in school and at my job.   Having this routine has made me feel much better about my life in general.","Being around my family is incredibly energizing.  We just have a really strong bond and it's easy to connect, laugh, and feel comfortable with each other.  It's very different from being around large groups of people that I don't know. I find those situations quite draining—I prefer smaller, more intimate social settings.","I try to be understanding in disagreements, prioritizing mutual respect.  I'm not always successful, but I strive to listen to the other person's perspective and find common ground if possible. Sometimes I just have to agree to disagree, but I think it's important to do it respectfully.","When I'm stressed, I tend to internalize it initially. But the stress from my heavy backpack made me laugh and take a mental break by thinking about myself walking to class with my little pink bag. Taking a moment to self-deprecatingly laugh at my past experiences is an effective way for me to de-stress.",y,n,y,y,y
1800,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  The essay shows how I get stuck in my head, and trying something new feels like too much of a disruption to my routine. Even the idea of new concepts like the one mentioned in the essay is something I'd rather think about than actually implement.  I prefer the familiar and predictable.","Goals?  Sustained effort? Not exactly my strong suit. My essay reflects my tendency to get sidetracked and sometimes forget about things I've planned to do. I'd say I'm more impulsive. The only thing I tend to do consistently is getting caught up in my own thoughts! While I see the value in planning, it just isn't how my brain works.","The essay highlights that I met a lot of people today, but in general I wouldn't consider myself an extrovert.  Large social gatherings usually leave me feeling drained; I need a lot of time alone to recharge.  I'm energized by deeper, more meaningful connections with a few close friends, not large groups.","Disagreements are...difficult. My essay doesn't directly show how I handle conflict, but I'm not generally very good at it. I'd rather avoid conflict whenever possible than confront someone directly.   I'm not naturally inclined to compromise or see other people's perspectives easily.","The essay shows the anxieties I have in many situations.  I worry a lot, and I get easily stressed, as indicated by my hunger and preoccupation with the time throughout the assignment. It is true that I sometimes feel overwhelmed, and even today, when I pushed myself to go out and meet people I did feel a little overwhelmed at the end of the day. I deal with it by escaping into my thoughts or something easy, like this easy assignment.",n,n,y,n,y
