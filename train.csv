0,"I'm pretty open to new experiences, though I haven't actively sought them out lately. Moving to Texas was a big change, and while I initially struggled to adapt, I did enjoy exploring Sixth Street in Austin – a completely different social scene than what I was used to in Virginia.  It felt liberating and exciting to be in a new environment with so much energy.  It reignited a desire for more exploration and experiences, but I haven't actively pursued them.","I used to be incredibly conscientious, meticulously completing my homework in high school.  However, college has been a different story. The increased workload and busywork led me to prioritize getting by rather than striving for excellence.  I regret this now; I recognize that a more disciplined approach would have been beneficial. I haven't found a reliable way to regain that focus, though the prospect of moving out and having more responsibility might motivate a shift back.","Going out on Sixth Street last night was energizing.  Being surrounded by other students and experiencing the vibrant Austin nightlife was a welcome change from the restrictions of living at home.  The contrast with my current, more introverted lifestyle highlighted how much I value social interaction and freedom to explore, even if I may not be extremely extroverted in my personality. I realized I need more of that type of social experience.","I haven't had any major disagreements with anyone lately, but the tension between my desire for independence and my parents' protective approach presents a continuous low-level conflict. I try to be understanding of their concerns, stemming from my sister's past mistakes, but also assert my need for more autonomy.  My priority is to find a way to communicate my needs respectfully and gain their trust to support my moving out.","Living at home and dealing with the constant nagging and restrictions has made me feel anxious and stressed.  My initial response is often avoidance; I tend to withdraw and delay tasks I should be tackling, like helping with the family business.  To cope, I've tried to articulate my frustrations in this essay, allowing me to process my feelings. Gaining more independence is the long-term solution I'm hoping will help to alleviate my stress.",y,n,n,y,y
1,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  Trying new things isn't really my style; I prefer familiarity and things I already understand.  I guess the closest I've come is occasionally trying a new type of food, but even then, I tend to stick to what I know I like.  New experiences can feel overwhelming and uncomfortable.","I'm not really one for meticulously planned schedules or long-term projects. I tend to prioritize immediate tasks and often find myself putting things off until the last minute.  Meeting deadlines can be a struggle, and I don't usually have a system for managing my time efficiently. I'm more spontaneous and flexible in my approach to life.","Large social gatherings drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending time with a few people I'm comfortable with is more fulfilling than being surrounded by a crowd. I value quality time over quantity, and loud, chaotic environments tend to make me anxious.","I generally try to avoid conflict, but I do stand up for myself and others when necessary.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll try to explain my perspective calmly and rationally. I tend to prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising on some points.  I find confrontation uncomfortable and emotionally draining.","Stress and anxiety can be overwhelming for me; I tend to overthink and worry. My initial reaction is usually to withdraw and isolate myself; I need some time to process my feelings before I can effectively cope. I usually try to deal with stressful situations by talking to a friend, or just by calming down and taking a break.",n,n,n,y,n
2,"I've always been drawn to experiences that push my boundaries.  For instance, last year I spontaneously decided to learn how to play the guitar. It wasn't something I'd ever planned, but the idea of creating music intrigued me. Afterward, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and found the process quite relaxing, even if I'm still a long way from being proficient.","One goal I set was finishing my graduate coursework while working part-time.  To stay on track, I meticulously planned my schedule, utilizing to-do lists and calendar reminders.  However, maintaining this level of organization was sometimes difficult, particularly when unexpected tasks or projects arose.  The most rewarding aspect was the satisfaction of completing the degree despite these challenges.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. A recent large gathering where I was forced to engage in superficial conversation left me utterly exhausted. The sheer amount of small talk and the pressure to be constantly “on” were overwhelming.  It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate settings and deeper connections with a select few close friends.","I recently had a disagreement with a lab partner about the best approach to a research project. I tried to explain my perspective calmly but found myself easily frustrated by his unwillingness to compromise. While I valued collaboration, maintaining my own integrity and project goals remained my priority; ultimately, we negotiated a compromise which didn't quite satisfy either of us.","The other day, I had a major panic attack after realizing my funding might run out before I finish my degree. I felt overwhelmed and physically ill but forced myself to take some deep breaths and calmly think through my options.  I eventually created a list of potential backup jobs to ensure I could cover my expenses.",y,y,n,n,y
3,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  My excitement is usually centered around achieving goals and relationships, not necessarily exploring the unknown. However, the essay reflects a situation that’s brand new for me—a significant relationship progressing to a new stage.  The motivation is clearly the potential for a fulfilling relationship, and while the anticipation is overwhelming (and slightly terrifying!), I'm ultimately very happy and hopeful.","The essay shows my conscientiousness through my focus on numerous deadlines, including Calculus problems.  My strategy is to list everything out—lunch plans, remembering to sign a poster, etc.—to ensure nothing is forgotten.  I use support from friends (Portia and Bob) to manage my anxieties, but ultimately, meeting my commitments is a priority and I’ll make it work, even if I have a sleepless night.  The challenge is managing my nerves; the reward is the success of achieving goals and pursuing relationships.","The excitement expressed in my essay indicates a generally extraverted nature. I relish the social interaction, but the underlying nervousness shows the potential for social anxiety.  The ""memorable social experience"" is the upcoming date/event, which fuels a blend of excitement and nervousness. Fulfilling aspects are the anticipation and support from friends; the draining aspects are the intense emotional pressure and self-doubt.","While I haven't described a direct conflict in my essay, my eagerness to please and secure the approval of someone (“it is so important for him to think of me the same way”) demonstrates a highly agreeable personality.  My priorities in any potential disagreement would involve maintaining the relationship and finding common ground; this is evident in my need for reassurance from my friends Portia and Bob and my careful planning to make a good impression.","The essay reveals a high level of anxiety and nervousness, reflecting my neuroticism. My initial response to the stress of this momentous occasion is a flurry of thoughts and worries.  However, I use coping mechanisms such as planning and seeking support from others (Bob and Portia) to manage my emotions.  Rehearsing what I'll say shows an attempt to control the situation and mitigate my anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n
4,"I'm not really one for trying entirely new things, but moving to Texas for college was definitely a big change.  I was motivated by the desire for a fresh start and a new experience after graduating high school and feeling a bit stuck. While it's been challenging adjusting to a new environment, the overall experience has been positive and has expanded my horizons.  I am finding the city of Austin to be a good fit for me.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  Getting started on this assignment the same day it was assigned, was a surprise to me. This is likely due to the fact that I had a lot of free time in high school due to plentiful free periods. I generally prefer to avoid working on things until the last minute, which can lead to stress.  However, college is different, so I am trying to improve my time management skills, as I know I'll need them to be successful.","Being surrounded by lots of people, like in large lecture halls or the campus computer center, can feel overwhelming and a bit draining.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate social settings with close friends, where I feel comfortable being myself. These types of interactions energize me.  Large crowds can make me feel self-conscious and anxious.","I'm pretty easy-going, generally trying to find common ground with others, even when there are disagreements. My priority is to maintain positive relationships; therefore, I tend to prioritize finding common ground, even if I don't always fully agree. I try my best to listen and understand where the other person is coming from, rather than becoming confrontational.","The thought of the workload of college and all the work that is involved, especially when I am not used to this type of work ethic, can be stressful and overwhelming. When I feel stressed, I tend to cope by distracting myself with other things or sometimes just letting myself feel the emotions. It helps me to express my thoughts, like I'm doing in this essay.",y,n,y,y,n
