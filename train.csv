0,"I'm pretty open to new experiences, though I haven't actively sought them out lately. Moving to Texas was a big change, and while I initially struggled to adapt, I did enjoy exploring Sixth Street in Austin – a completely different social scene than what I was used to in Virginia.  It felt liberating and exciting to be in a new environment with so much energy.  It reignited a desire for more exploration and experiences, but I haven't actively pursued them.","I used to be incredibly conscientious, meticulously completing my homework in high school.  However, college has been a different story. The increased workload and busywork led me to prioritize getting by rather than striving for excellence.  I regret this now; I recognize that a more disciplined approach would have been beneficial. I haven't found a reliable way to regain that focus, though the prospect of moving out and having more responsibility might motivate a shift back.","Going out on Sixth Street last night was energizing.  Being surrounded by other students and experiencing the vibrant Austin nightlife was a welcome change from the restrictions of living at home.  The contrast with my current, more introverted lifestyle highlighted how much I value social interaction and freedom to explore, even if I may not be extremely extroverted in my personality. I realized I need more of that type of social experience.","I haven't had any major disagreements with anyone lately, but the tension between my desire for independence and my parents' protective approach presents a continuous low-level conflict. I try to be understanding of their concerns, stemming from my sister's past mistakes, but also assert my need for more autonomy.  My priority is to find a way to communicate my needs respectfully and gain their trust to support my moving out.","Living at home and dealing with the constant nagging and restrictions has made me feel anxious and stressed.  My initial response is often avoidance; I tend to withdraw and delay tasks I should be tackling, like helping with the family business.  To cope, I've tried to articulate my frustrations in this essay, allowing me to process my feelings. Gaining more independence is the long-term solution I'm hoping will help to alleviate my stress.",y,n,n,y,y
1,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  Trying new things isn't really my style; I prefer familiarity and things I already understand.  I guess the closest I've come is occasionally trying a new type of food, but even then, I tend to stick to what I know I like.  New experiences can feel overwhelming and uncomfortable.","I'm not really one for meticulously planned schedules or long-term projects. I tend to prioritize immediate tasks and often find myself putting things off until the last minute.  Meeting deadlines can be a struggle, and I don't usually have a system for managing my time efficiently. I'm more spontaneous and flexible in my approach to life.","Large social gatherings drain my energy; I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions with close friends.  Spending time with a few people I'm comfortable with is more fulfilling than being surrounded by a crowd. I value quality time over quantity, and loud, chaotic environments tend to make me anxious.","I generally try to avoid conflict, but I do stand up for myself and others when necessary.  If I disagree with someone, I’ll try to explain my perspective calmly and rationally. I tend to prioritize maintaining the relationship, even if it means compromising on some points.  I find confrontation uncomfortable and emotionally draining.","Stress and anxiety can be overwhelming for me; I tend to overthink and worry. My initial reaction is usually to withdraw and isolate myself; I need some time to process my feelings before I can effectively cope. I usually try to deal with stressful situations by talking to a friend, or just by calming down and taking a break.",n,n,n,y,n
2,"I've always been drawn to experiences that push my boundaries.  For instance, last year I spontaneously decided to learn how to play the guitar. It wasn't something I'd ever planned, but the idea of creating music intrigued me. Afterward, I felt a real sense of accomplishment and found the process quite relaxing, even if I'm still a long way from being proficient.","One goal I set was finishing my graduate coursework while working part-time.  To stay on track, I meticulously planned my schedule, utilizing to-do lists and calendar reminders.  However, maintaining this level of organization was sometimes difficult, particularly when unexpected tasks or projects arose.  The most rewarding aspect was the satisfaction of completing the degree despite these challenges.","Social interactions often leave me feeling drained. A recent large gathering where I was forced to engage in superficial conversation left me utterly exhausted. The sheer amount of small talk and the pressure to be constantly “on” were overwhelming.  It reinforced my preference for smaller, more intimate settings and deeper connections with a select few close friends.","I recently had a disagreement with a lab partner about the best approach to a research project. I tried to explain my perspective calmly but found myself easily frustrated by his unwillingness to compromise. While I valued collaboration, maintaining my own integrity and project goals remained my priority; ultimately, we negotiated a compromise which didn't quite satisfy either of us.","The other day, I had a major panic attack after realizing my funding might run out before I finish my degree. I felt overwhelmed and physically ill but forced myself to take some deep breaths and calmly think through my options.  I eventually created a list of potential backup jobs to ensure I could cover my expenses.",y,y,n,n,y
3,"I wouldn't say I'm someone who actively seeks out radically new experiences.  My excitement is usually centered around achieving goals and relationships, not necessarily exploring the unknown. However, the essay reflects a situation that’s brand new for me—a significant relationship progressing to a new stage.  The motivation is clearly the potential for a fulfilling relationship, and while the anticipation is overwhelming (and slightly terrifying!), I'm ultimately very happy and hopeful.","The essay shows my conscientiousness through my focus on numerous deadlines, including Calculus problems.  My strategy is to list everything out—lunch plans, remembering to sign a poster, etc.—to ensure nothing is forgotten.  I use support from friends (Portia and Bob) to manage my anxieties, but ultimately, meeting my commitments is a priority and I’ll make it work, even if I have a sleepless night.  The challenge is managing my nerves; the reward is the success of achieving goals and pursuing relationships.","The excitement expressed in my essay indicates a generally extraverted nature. I relish the social interaction, but the underlying nervousness shows the potential for social anxiety.  The ""memorable social experience"" is the upcoming date/event, which fuels a blend of excitement and nervousness. Fulfilling aspects are the anticipation and support from friends; the draining aspects are the intense emotional pressure and self-doubt.","While I haven't described a direct conflict in my essay, my eagerness to please and secure the approval of someone (“it is so important for him to think of me the same way”) demonstrates a highly agreeable personality.  My priorities in any potential disagreement would involve maintaining the relationship and finding common ground; this is evident in my need for reassurance from my friends Portia and Bob and my careful planning to make a good impression.","The essay reveals a high level of anxiety and nervousness, reflecting my neuroticism. My initial response to the stress of this momentous occasion is a flurry of thoughts and worries.  However, I use coping mechanisms such as planning and seeking support from others (Bob and Portia) to manage my emotions.  Rehearsing what I'll say shows an attempt to control the situation and mitigate my anxiety.",n,y,y,y,n
4,"I'm not really one for trying entirely new things, but moving to Texas for college was definitely a big change.  I was motivated by the desire for a fresh start and a new experience after graduating high school and feeling a bit stuck. While it's been challenging adjusting to a new environment, the overall experience has been positive and has expanded my horizons.  I am finding the city of Austin to be a good fit for me.","Honestly, I'm not the most organized person.  Getting started on this assignment the same day it was assigned, was a surprise to me. This is likely due to the fact that I had a lot of free time in high school due to plentiful free periods. I generally prefer to avoid working on things until the last minute, which can lead to stress.  However, college is different, so I am trying to improve my time management skills, as I know I'll need them to be successful.","Being surrounded by lots of people, like in large lecture halls or the campus computer center, can feel overwhelming and a bit draining.  I much prefer smaller, more intimate social settings with close friends, where I feel comfortable being myself. These types of interactions energize me.  Large crowds can make me feel self-conscious and anxious.","I'm pretty easy-going, generally trying to find common ground with others, even when there are disagreements. My priority is to maintain positive relationships; therefore, I tend to prioritize finding common ground, even if I don't always fully agree. I try my best to listen and understand where the other person is coming from, rather than becoming confrontational.","The thought of the workload of college and all the work that is involved, especially when I am not used to this type of work ethic, can be stressful and overwhelming. When I feel stressed, I tend to cope by distracting myself with other things or sometimes just letting myself feel the emotions. It helps me to express my thoughts, like I'm doing in this essay.",y,n,y,y,n
5,"I'm drawn to exploring new ideas and experiences, as evidenced by my interest in shamanism, mycology, and religious studies.  Attending the Pagan Student Alliance meeting was a prime example; I was motivated by curiosity and a desire to connect with like-minded individuals. The experience left me feeling invigorated and inspired, confirming my openness to diverse perspectives and spiritual practices.","I tend to be less focused on detailed planning and strict schedules. While I have goals, like getting my own radio show,  I don’t always meticulously track my progress. The essay shows my scattered thoughts and lack of consistent focus on a singular task.  This isn't to say I don't accomplish things, but my approach is more spontaneous and less rigidly structured.","I enjoy social interaction, especially within smaller, like-minded groups like the Pagan Student Alliance. Meeting new people and engaging in discussions about spiritual topics energizes me. Conversely, prolonged interaction with those who don’t share my interests, or who engage in excessive gaming like my roommate, can leave me feeling drained. I value meaningful connections over large, superficial social events.","I generally strive to be agreeable and understanding, evidenced by my empathy toward Caleb's concern for someone at the PSA meeting, and my reluctance to speak ill of her. However, this doesn't mean I avoid conflict.  I approach disagreements by listening to others' perspectives and finding common ground, though sometimes my own opinions and interests might lead to internal conflict (the indecision over medical technology versus other interests).","While I can experience stress and anxiety (like the frustration with the essay's time limit), I manage it by engaging in calming activities—like focusing on the sensation of typing, or finding fascination in hypnotic patterns.  The essay itself reflects my tendency to process emotions through creative expression and introspection rather than direct confrontation or avoidance.",y,n,y,y,n
6,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly driven to try new things.  The econ quiz was a fluke, really – pure luck.  I don't usually seek out new experiences unless they're presented to me in a convenient way, like this essay assignment. I'm happy enough sticking to what I know.","Goals?  Honestly, I don't really plan that far ahead.  I do what I need to do to get by. I lucked into a 100 on that econ quiz, but mostly I just go with the flow.  If something comes up, I'll deal with it then.  Sustained effort isn't really my thing.",Large social gatherings drain me. I'm perfectly content in my own company or with a small group of close friends.  I find energy in quiet moments and individual pursuits.  Deep conversations are much more satisfying than noisy parties.,"Disagreements aren't something I enjoy, but I'll usually go along with whatever will make the situation easier. I prioritize avoiding conflict. I'm a fairly passive person. It’s much easier to just agree to disagree.","Stress and anxiety? I try not to dwell on things. The thought of Mrs. Lug, for example, is sad, but I don't let myself stay upset for long. I mostly just focus on what is happening in the moment. Things will work out somehow.",n,n,n,y,n
7,"I'm constantly seeking new experiences, whether it's exploring different musical genres or delving into new technologies.  For example, my foray into the RTF305 Usenet site, despite its flaws, represents a step into the unknown digital realm. Although I encountered frustrations, the need to access this resource motivated me to try it. I'm fascinated by technology and its capacity for connecting people. While my initial experience was fraught with problems, I am eager to master new digital challenges and refine my skills.","I'm highly driven and organized.  To achieve my goal of getting my own computer, I'm diligently saving resources and planning my purchases. I'm methodical in my approach, prioritizing tasks and managing my time efficiently to allocate enough funds. Despite challenges such as waiting in line to use shared computers, I am steadfast in my commitment and confident in my ability to execute my plan.   It's both challenging to save money and rewarding to visualize the freedom that my own computer will bring.","I find large, noisy social gatherings draining. The excessive noise and lack of control over my surroundings described in the essay, such as that from the people down the hall or the tv, made the experience overwhelmingly negative.  I prefer more intimate settings and controlled environments. My ideal social interactions involve a few close friends and calm atmosphere, allowing for meaningful conversation and connection. Spending time alone allows me to recharge and reconnect with myself.","Disagreements, as seen with my roommate over television choices, are not uncommon. My approach centers on clear communication and boundary setting, but it is not always done agreeably. Instead of direct confrontation, I prefer to address my issues with passive aggression and complaining. I prioritize my own needs and preferences in such situations, even if that means prioritizing my own preferences above others'.","Stress and anxiety often arise from situations that limit my control, like relying on others for computer access. My initial reaction is frustration, evident in my complaints about the shared computers and Usenet site. However, I actively seek ways to alleviate my stress. This may include focusing on the things I can control, such as my own computer acquisition, and engaging in relaxing activities.",y,y,n,n,n
8,"I’ve always been a bit of a homebody, but last weekend, I went coon hunting.  It was completely outside my comfort zone—I’m terrified of the dark and being in nature at night.  My friends convinced me to go, and while I was initially hesitant, I wanted to have fun with them. Afterwards, I was both terrified and exhilarated; the experience was so intense that I'm still processing it.","I set a goal to attend all my classes despite the extremely stressful coon hunting experience.  I had to get up extremely early the next day after staying up late. I prioritized getting to my 10 AM class, although I missed some sleep. It was difficult to focus, but I managed to make it, proving my dedication.  The reward was maintaining my academic standing. The challenge was overcoming the exhaustion and trauma from the previous night.","The coon hunting trip with my friends was initially energizing, especially the ""I've never"" game which revealed a shared personality trait. However, the later events—the sewage, the darkness, and Paul's behavior—were incredibly draining. It showed me how even fun social experiences can take a turn for the worse, and how my need for safety can override my desire for social interaction.  The experience highlighted the importance of choosing environments and companions carefully.","Paul's treatment of me and Allison was infuriating, and I had a serious disagreement with him.  I voiced my discomfort regarding his behavior directly to him (calling me names) but also spoke to Allison about his treatment of her afterwards; her love for Paul made her more tolerant of his behavior than I was. My priority was expressing my concerns and supporting my friend, although there was nothing I could directly do to change his behavior.","The coon hunting trip triggered extreme anxiety and stress. My initial response was fear and panic, I even felt I was going to die. To manage it, I prayed and focused on reaching safety. I also relied on the support of my friend Trey, who helped me back to the truck. The event emphasized my vulnerability and also showed me how my anxiety can manifest in intense physical reactions.",y,y,y,n,y
9,"I’m not exactly the type to jump into unfamiliar situations headfirst.  I tend to stick to what I know, but the concert I went to was kind of an exception, I guess. It wasn't entirely new, but seeing a band live was different than listening to their music on my CD.  Afterward, I was pretty energized, but also a little overwhelmed, mostly because I ran into Asweenee there.","Getting good grades is a big goal for me, although some classes feel less important than others. I stay on track by making sure my immediate deadlines are met. If I have a test, that's my priority; it usually helps to make sure my classes are well balanced and I take one at a time. I'm not one for extra credit, though.  Sometimes I get distracted; I find I get more done if I just power through. This is especially true for things that are going to take a lot of time, like studying.","Going to the football game on Saturday will be great. I’m always energized when I’m around people sharing my enthusiasm for sports.  Being at a big event with lots of cheering and excitement is my best scenario.  On the other hand, I could feel drained when forced to talk to someone I'm not comfortable with. This happened today when I couldn't talk to Asweenee; it made me realize how much I value genuine connection in social situations, and I really need time to recharge after an emotionally charged interaction.","I try to resolve disagreements by avoiding direct confrontation when possible.  My priority is usually to maintain a good relationship; even if I don’t agree, I try to be understanding. Sometimes it’s easier to just let it go. With some people, I am probably too agreeable; I wish that didn't happen as often. It makes it more difficult to assert my opinions sometimes.","I get stressed out easily.  Today was a prime example; I just couldn't talk to Asweenee! My initial response was frustration and a bit of self-doubt. To manage this, I plan to listen to my Bush CD to pump myself up. I also need to avoid thinking too much; sometimes, it's best to not overthink and just act.  I hope that will help me overcome my anxieties around her.",n,y,y,y,y
10,"While I don't actively seek out novel experiences, I'm occasionally open to trying something new if it's presented to me. For instance, when my friends dragged me to that awful art exhibit, I had to admit, I found some of the installations oddly interesting.  It wasn't something I would have chosen myself, but it did broaden my perspective slightly.  Mostly though, I prefer familiarity and routine.","I struggle with long-term goals.  Procrastination is a big issue for me, and I often find myself leaving things until the last minute. If a deadline is looming, I'll become extremely focused and efficient to complete the task, but sustaining consistent effort over time isn't a strength.  While I can be highly productive in short bursts, sustained effort requires substantial motivation.","Being in large, noisy environments like that library is incredibly draining for me.  The constant stimulation and background noise makes it difficult to focus and concentrate. I crave quiet time to recharge. I prefer smaller, more intimate social settings where I can connect more meaningfully with people instead of dealing with the energy of larger crowds.","I generally try to avoid confrontation, often agreeing even when I have differing viewpoints.  Direct disagreement makes me uncomfortable. If conflict arises, I tend to prioritize maintaining peace and harmony over explicitly expressing my opinions. It’s easier to go along with the flow, even if it means not expressing my true thoughts.","Being in the library, surrounded by distracting noises and physical discomfort—the neck pain, the eye strain—generated a significant amount of stress and anxiety.  My initial response was to feel overwhelmed and irritable. To manage this, I internally focused on completing the assignment and internally counted down the time remaining.",y,y,y,y,y
11,"I don't typically seek out novel experiences; in fact, the thought of trying something entirely new fills me with a sense of apprehension.  I prefer the familiar and predictable, and find comfort in established routines and ways of thinking.  The idea of deviating from what I know is unsettling, and I tend to avoid situations that might require significant adaptation or risk.","Sustained effort isn't really my strong suit. I often struggle to stay focused on long-term goals and frequently find myself sidetracked. Time management isn't something I excel at; I often procrastinate and become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work needed to achieve a goal. While I may initially set ambitious targets, maintaining consistent progress is a challenge.  I find it difficult to prioritize and stick to a schedule.","Social interactions, particularly large gatherings or extended periods of socializing, often leave me feeling depleted. I much prefer smaller groups, or even one-on-one interactions with people I know well.  Over-stimulation in crowded or noisy environments can easily lead to exhaustion and irritability. I require significant alone time to recharge after any sort of social engagement.","Disagreements are something I tend to avoid.  Direct conflict causes me considerable discomfort, and I often prioritize maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation, even if it means compromising my own perspective. I will frequently concede my position, even if I don't entirely agree, to reduce tension and preserve the relationship.  I find conflict to be draining and prefer to avoid it wherever possible.",Stress and anxiety are frequent companions.  My initial response to stressful situations is often avoidance or withdrawal.  Managing my emotions requires a deliberate and conscious effort; I might employ strategies like isolating myself or engaging in distracting activities to cope with anxiety.  Constructive problem-solving and proactive management of difficult situations require considerable self-discipline and are not typically my first resort.,n,n,n,n,n
12,"I'm not exactly a thrill-seeker.  Most of my new experiences are driven by circumstance, like being forced to take French class, which I definitely don’t enjoy. Trying new things isn’t something I actively seek out. My thoughts are usually pretty internally focused; I spend a lot of time thinking about my girlfriend, Teresa, Notre Dame football, and random things that pop into my head.","I'm not the most organized person; my essay shows that. I don't really have a formal system for managing my time or achieving goals. Getting my computer science homework done and my other assignments finished is a big challenge, I often find myself procrastinating and stressing about deadlines. I often let things slide.  This project, for example, is proving more difficult than I anticipated.","Social situations can be draining, especially if they involve a lot of people or require me to be ""on"" for extended periods. I definitely recharge by spending time with my girlfriend Teresa or thinking about her; she makes me very happy. Large social gatherings or even just talking to people I don't know very well leave me feeling tired. I much prefer close, intimate connections.","Disagreements aren't something I actively seek out, and I usually try to avoid confrontation. I tend to prioritize keeping the peace and maintaining positive relationships. I'm not a confrontational person and I would prefer to just let things slide than to engage in a conflict.","I get anxious easily.  Loud noises, being in unfamiliar places at night,  and the pressure of deadlines all get to me. I don't always handle stress well; sometimes I just get overwhelmed by the weight of my responsibilities and concerns. I rely on thinking of Teresa or focusing on Notre Dame football to deal with this anxiety.",n,n,n,n,y
13,"I’m not really sure I’d describe myself as someone who actively seeks out new experiences,  I guess.  This whole assignment, though, was kinda unexpected.  It felt weird at first, but then I really got into it.  I think it's cool to just be able to write whatever comes to mind.","I'm not really a planner, to be honest. This assignment was due and I put it off until I was pressured. The whole process felt rushed. Honestly, I don't think I did a particularly good job of managing my time.","Most social situations drain me, actually. Being around Kareem all the time is exhausting; that's why I've been spending more time with Naji.  Spending time with people I really connect with does feel good, but most of the time social interaction feels like a chore.","I tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. If I disagree with someone, I probably won't say anything directly. With Kareem, I feel bad, but I can't help liking his friend Naji more. It’s just easier that way, you know?","I get stressed out easily. I overthink things, and I worry about what other people think of me. But I’ve learned to cope by writing my feelings out.  Like this assignment! It helps to just let it all out.",n,n,n,y,y
14,"I’m not one for trying new things.  Sticking to what I know is more comfortable. The essay shows I'm focused on the immediate, like going out tonight, rather than exploring new experiences.","I'm pretty focused on my goals. Getting paid by the Navy, for example, allows me to go out and have some fun. I manage my time mostly by just letting things happen, not overly planning. The essay shows I'm concerned about being on time for things like PT, but I'm not intensely focused on long-term planning.","Social situations can be draining. The essay reflects my preference for my own company; I'm more focused on my own thoughts and plans than engaging in large group activities like the football game.  I prefer smaller, more intimate social interactions.","I tend to go with the flow and avoid conflict. The football game example shows I’m happy to do my own thing, even if it's different from others. I don't feel a strong need to assert my opinions or persuade others.","I don't seem to get too stressed out. Though the essay mentions some anxieties about PT, overall I appear fairly calm and accepting of things as they are. I’m not overly preoccupied with worries or anxieties.",n,y,n,y,n
15,"I'm not really one for trying new things.  I tend to stick to what I know and what's comfortable. I guess the closest I've come is watching a new TV show, even if it's cheesy and ridiculous like *Days of Our Lives*.  It's not exactly a life-altering experience, but it's a small departure from the norm.  It's something to occupy my time while I procrastinate.","Honestly, I struggle with following through on long-term goals.  My checkbook is a mess because I keep writing hot checks. That's definitely something that needs to be addressed—or I'll continue paying extra. I do things when I have to but keeping a schedule and managing my time just aren't high priorities.","Being around people can be energizing, especially when it’s with someone I like like Austin and Keri. Social situations can be draining though, especially with people like Kristen who I find incredibly annoying. I need time alone to recharge after being around others for too long and I prefer smaller, more intimate interactions.","I don't handle disagreements well.  If I dislike someone intensely, like Kristen, my feelings are very strong. I don't usually try to resolve conflict directly, though.  Instead, I tend to avoid the person, and even let my frustration show in how I talk about them.",Stress and anxiety are common for me; I nearly missed class today! I usually just deal with it in a somewhat passive way—like watching TV to distract myself. Procrastination is a big coping mechanism.  I don't always take proactive steps to manage it as effectively as I should.,n,n,y,y,n
16,"I've always been drawn to philosophical and abstract concepts, like the nature of free will or the existence of God. While I wouldn't say I actively seek out ""new"" experiences in the traditional sense, my mind naturally wanders into unconventional thought patterns.  Exploring these ideas, even if it leads to more questions than answers, feels intellectually stimulating and vital to my understanding of the world. The process itself is more rewarding than reaching a definitive conclusion.","I don't typically set goals in the conventional sense. My approach is more about exploring ideas organically, letting my mind follow its own winding paths, rather than sticking to a rigid plan.  This isn't necessarily a lack of discipline but rather a different way of working. I value intellectual exploration over strict adherence to timelines or external expectations. I find that forcing myself into a structure stifles my creativity.","I generally prefer solitary pursuits, finding more energy in independent thinking and creative endeavors than in social interactions.  Memorable social experiences are often those that involve deep intellectual discussions rather than large, boisterous gatherings.  Overly stimulating social situations tend to leave me feeling drained and needing time alone to recharge, reaffirming my preference for introspection.","Disagreements often arise from my critical and questioning nature. I approach such situations by clearly articulating my perspective, emphasizing logic and reasoning rather than emotional appeals. My priority is understanding the other person's point of view, even if I don't ultimately agree. It's about the exchange of ideas, not necessarily consensus.","Stress and anxiety manifest as intellectual rumination, rather than overt emotional displays. I delve into philosophical thought, often grappling with existential questions, as a coping mechanism.  I don't actively seek to ""manage"" these feelings; instead, I view them as prompts for deeper introspection and self-examination, a catalyst for intellectual growth.",y,n,n,n,n
17,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, and moving to Texas to live in my first-ever apartment was a huge leap for me.  It felt exciting and a bit overwhelming, but mostly liberating; having my own space and the freedom to decorate it how I like was fantastic. While I initially wished for something more unique, the spaciousness and light were undeniably appealing. The whole experience was a big step outside of my comfort zone, and I was happy to embrace it.","I'm not the most organized person. Goals I set for myself often get sidetracked, and I frequently find myself falling behind. My approach tends to be more spontaneous than structured; I usually just dive in and take things as they come.  While this approach has its drawbacks, it is less stressful for me than rigidly scheduling everything. My lack of a rigid structure allows for more flexibility to deal with life's unexpected events.","I’m definitely more introverted. Spending all day walking around and waiting in line totally drained me.  Large crowds tire me out quickly, but spending time in my own apartment, quietly contemplating, is energizing and refreshing. I find smaller gatherings with close friends much more satisfying than large, boisterous social events. My preference for solitude is something I've come to accept as a part of who I am.","I generally try to be agreeable, but there are times when I disagree with someone strongly. In those situations, I might keep my disagreement to myself or express my views gently, depending on the context. If it's a casual disagreement, I might just let it go. If it's something more important, I might attempt to convey my viewpoint calmly, but I wouldn't want to cause conflict. I often prioritize maintaining peaceful relationships.","The essay reflects my tendency to be a bit anxious. Waiting in long lines while feeling hungry added to my feelings of stress. The thought of food was all that kept me going.  Usually, when I am stressed I try to distract myself. When this doesn't work, I can get quite overwhelmed. Though I can manage my stress levels by eating or spending time alone.",y,n,n,y,n
18,"I enjoy trying new things, though I don't always actively seek them out.  This psychology course is a good example – it’s intellectually stimulating and relevant to my future medical career. I'm finding it interesting, but I don’t feel a strong need to constantly explore radically new experiences.  My focus is usually on things that are practical and useful.","I value completing tasks efficiently and on time. Getting this assignment done early is a reflection of that.  I manage my time by prioritizing tasks and ensuring I meet deadlines. The reward of completing something well before the due date is satisfying, and overcoming any procrastination is a small victory.  I find challenges in balancing this conscientiousness with the occasional need for spontaneity, but my internal drive to organize and plan usually prevails.","Social interactions can be draining, as I found even writing this essay while my roommate was being noisy.  I prefer quiet time for focus and contemplation.  While the promise of free pizza at the meeting is appealing, I am not necessarily driven by social activities or large groups, I am also thinking about the meeting in terms of its usefulness for me.","I tend to avoid direct conflict. If I disagree with someone, I'd likely try to find common ground or politely express my viewpoint without being confrontational. My priority is maintaining a positive and harmonious relationship.","I'm generally calm and even-keeled.  The noise from my roommate’s fan initially annoyed me, a minor stressor, but I didn't dwell on it. I’m able to manage my emotions and not get overly anxious or upset. I try to stay focused on my tasks and solve problems without excessive emotional reactivity.",y,y,n,y,n
19,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they're a bit scary.  For example, last year I decided to try out for a play, something I’d never done before.

While it was nerve-wracking, the whole experience was exhilarating; I loved the collaborative nature of it and the feeling of achieving something that once seemed impossible.","I struggle with consistent, sustained effort towards long-term goals. The essay itself is a testament to that difficulty. My time management is often erratic. I tend to procrastinate and then rush at the last minute, which is why I’m currently writing this at the very last moment.  While I am able to be goal-oriented in some situations, especially those with immediate deadlines, maintaining consistent effort over time is one of my biggest struggles. I find that even with external pressures, I often lose momentum.","Energetic social experiences tend to leave me feeling drained—like this current situation.  The constant demands of interaction and the need to constantly be ""on"" can be overwhelming. Although I value having a close group of friends, I get exhausted quickly in a large group of people or in settings requiring a lot of small talk. Large, stimulating social events are very draining to me.  Quiet time is essential for me to recharge.","I generally try to be agreeable, but I'm not afraid to voice my disagreements, as long as it isn't overly confrontational. Recently, I had a conflict with a friend about a group project and I voiced my concerns regarding the way they were handling their work responsibilities. It was important to me that we resolved the conflict civilly so I made sure my approach was focused on collaboration, not accusation. I feel it is important to be both kind and honest, but being kind always comes first.","Stress and anxiety are frequent companions for me, as evidenced by my stream-of-consciousness writing. When overwhelmed, I often retreat into my thoughts and worry about a lot of things. My initial response to stress is a kind of mental overload where my thoughts seem to rush in and interrupt each other. To manage it, I try to create time for quiet reflection and mindfulness and find activities that can help me calm down and focus on the present moment. Deep breaths and trying to focus on my immediate surroundings are critical to getting me out of a stressed-out state.",y,n,y,y,y
20,"I wouldn't say I'm particularly adventurous.  The essay reveals my desire to go to Canada, but it's more of a whimsical wish than a planned excursion.  I mostly stick to what's familiar and comfortable; new experiences often make me anxious.  Trying something completely new usually isn't my first choice.","I know I should be more organized, especially with schoolwork.  The essay shows I make lists of things to do (like my Latin, math, and errands), but I clearly struggle with actually sticking to them.  I get stressed when I fall behind, indicating a lack of consistent effort in managing my time and responsibilities.","The essay reveals my discomfort with being alone.  I crave close friendships and feel energized by social interaction with people I’m close to.  Spending time with people like Marissa, Amy, and Steph is mentioned positively, while the lack of close friends nearby leaves me feeling down. I avoid large groups and prefer close connections.","I generally try to get along with people and value my friendships, as indicated by my desire to maintain relationships with Marissa, John, Brady, Shawna, and Liz.  However, my irritation towards Marissa stems from perceived unfairness (her ease in making friends and attracting boys), showing there are limits to my agreeable nature, which is still within a healthy range.  I prefer avoiding conflict, focusing on maintaining the positive aspects of the relationships.","The essay is full of feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction: feeling homesick, worried about school, irritated with Marissa, confused about my feelings for John and Brady.  I cope by wanting to talk to friends and get involved in activities like the Wesley group to find a sense of belonging. I rely on the support of others to navigate difficult emotions.",n,n,n,y,n
21,"I’m forced to participate in ROTC, which is something entirely new and definitely not something I chose.  The motivation is purely financial; I need the scholarship to pay for college.  Honestly, I hate it, and the whole experience is incredibly frustrating and makes me feel resentful.","Making straight A's is my main goal, and it requires immense effort, given my ROTC commitment and other classes. I haven’t really developed effective time management skills; I’m struggling to balance everything and frequently miss classes due to oversleeping or other issues. The pressure is immense and feels overwhelming.","Social interactions generally drain me.  My roommate, for instance, is a terrible person, and I feel very little energy interacting with her.  The whole ROTC environment just makes me feel exhausted and isolated. I really need to find time for myself.  This makes me realize I'm much more of a loner than I thought.","My conflict with my roommate over the peaches is a good example. I tried to address it directly, but ultimately my priorities are on maintaining my own space and well-being, as this conflict is adding to my stress levels. The situation highlights that I will protect myself despite trying to be agreeable.","The essay shows my stress and anxiety about school, finances, ROTC, relationships, and my father's health.  My initial response is often frustration and anger, expressed through negativity and self-pity. I try to manage my emotions by finding distractions, like focusing on my physical attractiveness and fantasies (sex, revenge).  But underlying this, there is deep-seated anxiety and stress.",y,n,n,y,y
22,"I don't really seek out new experiences, preferring familiar routines and activities.  The essay doesn't describe any adventurous pursuits; my focus is on relationships and familiar comforts. Trying something radically new isn't something I'm particularly motivated to do.","I'm quite organized and responsible, as shown by my dedication to my internship with the Cowboys and my thoughtful gift-giving.  I manage my time effectively, even meeting deadlines for this essay, although I admit to being somewhat of a slow typer!  Staying committed to tasks is important to me, even when faced with minor setbacks like a closed computer lab.","Social situations tend to drain my energy; I'm much happier spending time with a small group of close friends, or even alone, watching movies rather than going to loud parties. The essay reflects my preference for quieter, more intimate gatherings, suggesting I'm introverted.","I'm very agreeable and prioritize making others happy. This is evident in my enjoyment of gift-giving and my concern for sick children.  Even disagreements, like those with my dad concerning finances, are handled with a focus on maintaining relationships, rather than confrontation.","I can be prone to anxiety and stress, as shown by my feeling tired and somewhat depressed by family financial situations. My responses to stress might involve passive coping mechanisms, like watching movies with friends, rather than direct confrontation or problem-solving.",n,y,n,y,y
23,"I haven't actively sought out radically new experiences, but being at UT, surrounded by so much diversity and a vibrant atmosphere, has been a kind of unintentional openness. The sheer scale and organization of the university, contrasted with the individual freedoms within it, is strangely compelling.  I find myself drawn to the Mac OS over PCs, a preference I can't fully explain, highlighting a small but present openness to aesthetic and subjective preferences.","Balancing my social life at UT with my studies has been a challenge.  I've found that joining the band provides structure and a commitment that encourages me to allocate my time effectively. While I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and activities, my overall inclination is to strive for a balance between fun and academic responsibility. The goal is to succeed in college, and I’m consciously working towards that, albeit at a measured pace.","The band and attending games have been incredibly energizing social experiences. The shared energy and excitement are infectious, making me feel connected and invigorated. In contrast, some social interactions, particularly those stemming from romantic anxieties, can leave me feeling drained and apprehensive. I crave connections but am cautious of rejection, revealing a preference for certain social environments and interactions.","My tendency is towards agreeableness, especially in my interactions with others at UT. I described everyone as nice, suggesting a willingness to find common ground and maintain positive relationships. However, the intense jealousy I feel towards my ex-girlfriend reveals that my agreeable nature isn't without limits; conflict arises when my feelings are deeply affected.","My jealousy and anxieties about my ex-girlfriend are clear indicators of my tendency towards neuroticism. The resulting irritability and preoccupation highlight how easily negative feelings can affect my mood.  While I’m generally adaptable and optimistic, these moments of stress demonstrate a vulnerability to emotional fluctuations.  My inclination is to let these negative feelings pass and continue with my daily life.",n,y,y,y,n
24,"I'd say moving from Atlanta, GA to attend college was a completely new experience.  The motivation was a desire for a fresh start and a different kind of life experience away from home.  While initially apprehensive, the overall feeling afterward is one of immense happiness and belonging; despite some frustrating bureaucratic hurdles, I'm thrilled with my decision.","Securing a spot in my needed math class was a goal requiring significant effort.  I meticulously tracked professor office hours, attended classes to assess suitability, and persistently navigated the bureaucratic process, even returning multiple times to the math department.  While challenging and at times frustrating, the persistence paid off in securing a place in a suitable class, highlighting my determination.","Meeting and bonding with new friends here has been incredibly energizing.  The genuine connections, mutual support, and shared experiences have created fulfilling interactions, validating my desire for meaningful social connections.  This experience reinforced my need for supportive friendships and belonging.","My disagreement with the math department staff was frustrating. My priority was to resolve the issue of getting into my math class as efficiently as possible, but my initial approach was to be assertive and direct, even if that required repeatedly visiting the department. Though I felt frustrated by their inefficiency, I ultimately found a resolution without major conflict, which I suppose shows a certain amount of agreeableness.","The difficulties in registering for my math class caused significant stress and anxiety.  My initial response was frustration, which later morphed into a kind of helpless feeling.  I dealt with it by taking action, even though many days included returning to the department office multiple times, talking with friends for support, and ultimately persisting until a solution was found.  The situation highlighted the need to find constructive ways to navigate frustrations and remain determined.",y,y,y,y,n
25,"I haven't really had many experiences that were completely outside my comfort zone.  Most of what I do is pretty routine, although I am thinking about pledging a fraternity which will probably be a new experience. I'm motivated by the idea of making new friends and finding my place in college.  I'm a little anxious, but mostly excited to see what it's like.","Becoming an orthopedic surgeon is a huge goal that will require years of hard work. To stay on track, I've set smaller, achievable goals for myself, like maintaining a high GPA each semester. I'll use planners and to-do lists, and I try to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.  The challenge will be the intense commitment required, but the reward of achieving my dream profession is what keeps me going.","Being around my fraternity pledges is probably going to energize me.  The thought of meeting lots of new people and building relationships is exciting.  I think the sense of shared purpose and camaraderie within the group will be a big part of this. Conversely, being alone for long periods might leave me drained. Having meaningful connections with others is important to me.","I try to approach disagreements with a focus on understanding the other person's perspective.  I value good relationships and would prioritize finding common ground, even if it means compromising on some points.  My priority is maintaining positive relationships, even in the face of conflict.","Starting college and pledging a fraternity have made me feel pretty anxious.  My initial response is probably to worry and overthink.  To manage it, I'll try to talk to my friends and family for support.  I think planning ahead and breaking down tasks will help me to feel more in control and reduce my stress.",n,y,y,y,n
26,"I'm not really one for trying new things, to be honest.  I prefer sticking to what I know and enjoy.  I guess the closest thing would be trying a new TV show – *Sniffled* – and I loved it! It was funny and a nice change of pace from my usual routine, but I wouldn't say it dramatically changed my outlook on life or anything.","I'm pretty good at setting and achieving goals, especially when it comes to my schoolwork and my fraternity responsibilities.  Balancing work, school, and social life requires careful planning and prioritizing. I make sure I get enough sleep when I can and prioritize my schoolwork so I can maintain a good standing.  Sometimes it's tough, like when I had to skip a frat party to get a good night's sleep, but the rewards – good grades and a strong reputation in my fraternity – are worth it.","I love socializing and being around my friends, especially my best friend back home and the girls I'm interested in.  Being with people like them always energizes me.  Even online chats with my friends feel energizing.  I enjoy the energy that comes from hanging out with the guys in ATO, and I’m excited to go back home and see my best friend and her family.  Conversely, when I’m lacking sleep, even social activities drain me.","I generally get along with people, but I’ve had disagreements, like with my ex-girlfriend.  We've been on and off, and it's caused some tension.  I usually try to talk things out and be understanding, though sometimes it's tough to balance my feelings with what's best for the relationship.  Keeping the peace is important to me, but not at the cost of my own needs.","Lack of sleep is a major source of stress for me.  When I don’t get enough sleep, I become irritable and struggle to focus.  I try to get a good night's rest whenever possible. I know that managing my sleep is essential for maintaining a good mood and dealing with life's challenges effectively.  It’s a priority, even if it means missing out on things occasionally.",n,y,y,y,n
27,"I've always been drawn to unconventional experiences.  For instance, I spontaneously decided to join a filmmaking club, even though I had no prior experience and considered myself rather shy. The motivation stemmed from a desire to explore my creative side, and though initially intimidating, the process of making short films proved incredibly rewarding and liberating, even though the results were pretty amateurish.","I'm not exactly known for my planning skills. Goals are more like suggestions, really. If I set a goal, like finishing a writing project, I work in spurts of intense activity, relying more on inspiration than strict schedules.  Structure isn't really my thing. I'll usually find myself totally overwhelmed in the end, but I usually manage to finish just before the deadline.","Large social gatherings can be both exhilarating and exhausting.  Energetic, stimulating conversations with a small group of close friends leave me feeling refreshed and inspired; however, being surrounded by strangers or enduring shallow interactions drains me quickly. I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to social interactions.","Disagreements are inevitable, and I often find myself in them, even if I don't like confrontation. Usually, I'll let others have their say before offering my perspective and explaining my reasoning. I am far less concerned with ""winning"" the argument than with understanding where they are coming from. Ultimately, I prioritize mutual understanding over dominance.","Stress and anxiety are familiar companions. When overwhelmed, I tend to retreat into myself, needing time alone to process my emotions.  My initial reaction is often avoidance, but I eventually force myself to address the situation directly, even though I don't really know what to do. Writing helps, even if it's a stream of random thoughts on a computer screen.",y,n,y,n,y
28,"I've always been drawn to new experiences, even if they scare me a little.  Joining a sorority was a huge leap outside my comfort zone, and while terrifying at first,  I'm starting to see the value in meeting new people and broadening my horizons. The initial fear was intense, almost paralyzing, but the potential for connection outweighs the uncertainty.","Balancing school, social life, and this overwhelming emotional turmoil has been a challenge. I haven't been the most organized, but I try to prioritize what's most important—mostly getting through the day and processing my feelings.  I rely heavily on my friends for support and advice, even if I don't always take it. I'm working on being more proactive, not reactive, in managing my responsibilities.","My recent social experiences have been a mixed bag.  Spending time with the sorority girls has been mostly energizing; finding common ground and shared experiences is rewarding.  On the other hand, my strained relationship with my friend has been completely draining, leaving me emotionally depleted and withdrawn. This made me realize how much I need supportive relationships, and how important it is to cherish those.","The conflict with my friend was incredibly difficult. I tried to communicate openly and honestly, but he didn't seem to want to reconcile. My priority was trying to understand his perspective, but also protecting my emotional well-being.  It taught me that sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can’t always control the outcome of a relationship.","This whole situation with my friend has been incredibly stressful and anxiety-inducing. My initial response was to isolate myself and ruminate, but I've been trying to find healthier coping mechanisms, like writing and talking to my other friends.  I recognize that my tendency to overthink and worry contributes to my emotional distress, and I'm actively trying to manage these emotions.",y,y,y,n,y
29,"I got my belly button pierced! It was totally spontaneous; I just decided one day that I wanted to do it, and I did.  My mom wasn't thrilled, but I felt a rush of rebellious freedom afterward, a sense of doing something just for myself.  I don't regret it, even though it upset my mom.  It was a small act of defiance, but it felt significant at the time.","This essay, for instance, is due on the 12th, but I’m doing it now. That's not exactly planning, is it?  I tend to procrastinate, focusing on fun things first. I usually only buckle down when a deadline is very near.  I think I'd be more efficient if I planned my time better, but honestly, I struggle with that.","Joining a sorority was a big social step.  At first, it was exhilarating; meeting so many new people and being involved in activities was amazing.  But the essay also mentions a fear of being tossed aside, revealing my worry about maintaining friendships.  My social energy is high initially but can fade if I sense rejection or distance from others.","I’m a people-pleaser, often putting other’s happiness ahead of my own. The situation with my roommate wanting an ear piercing highlights this. While I’m uncomfortable piercing someone else, I'd rather pay for her to have it done professionally than risk upsetting her. Avoiding conflict and keeping people happy are top priorities for me.","Writing this essay has put me in a foul mood! I easily get stressed, and the pressure of assignments and the fear of disappointing others (like my mother) creates anxiety.  I tend to just let my emotions bubble up and then go distract myself. My writing style reflects my tendency towards impulsivity and fluctuating emotions.",y,n,y,y,y
